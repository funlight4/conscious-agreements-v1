# SECTION 10: PROSECUTION REALITY CHECK

## Why Criminal Prosecution Is Rare

### Systemic Barriers
1. **Regulatory Capture** - Prosecutors won't bite the hand
2. **Complexity** - Most don't understand money creation
3. **Resources** - Banks have unlimited legal funds
4. **Systemic Risk** - "Too big to fail" mentality

### Your Leverage Points
1. **Threat of prosecution** - Creates settlement pressure
2. **Public exposure** - Media and political pressure
3. **Multiple complaints** - Volume creates momentum
4. **Civil lawsuits** - Don't need prosecutor

---

# SECTION 11: COMBINED STRATEGY EXAMPLES

## Maximum Pressure Approach

1. **File criminal complaints** (all applicable statutes)
2. **File civil RICO** (triple damages)
3. **File 18 USC 1595** (slavery civil action)
4. **Public records** (affidavits and notices)
5. **Media campaign** (expose the fraud)
6. **Political pressure** (contact representatives)

## Stealth Approach

1. **Quiet title action** (burden on bank)
2. **Discovery demands** (expose fraud in litigation)
3. **Settlement negotiations** (use criminal statutes as leverage)
4. **Non-disclosure agreement** (they pay for silence)

## Defensive Counter-Attack

1. **Wait for foreclosure suit**
2. **Raise all defenses** (lack of consideration)
3. **File counterclaims** (all violations)
4. **Demand jury trial** (educate jurors)
5. **Settlement before trial** (they can't risk exposure)
