# The Violation Roadmap: From Your Signature to Their Crimes
*A Visual Guide to Banking Law Violations in the Mortgage Process*

## The Foundation: Understanding Your Power

**Critical Fact**: In our current monetary system, ALL currency consists of promissory notes. Federal Reserve Notes are simply standardized promises to pay. Therefore, when you sign a promissory note, you ARE providing payment in the recognized currency of the realm.

## THE VIOLATION TIMELINE

### ✅ MOMENT ZERO: The Legal Transaction
**You Sign Promissory Note for $300,000**
- You create a negotiable instrument (UCC 3-104)

- House is legally PAID at this moment
- Bank receives $300,000 asset

**Status**: ✅ Legal, valid, complete transaction

## THE PROTECTION RACKET

- Judges assume banks lend money

**Layer 2: Capture**
- DOJ won't prosecute banks
- Regulators are former bankers
- Judges have mortgages too

**Layer 3: Systemic Risk**
- "Too big to fail"
- Would expose entire system
- Economic collapse fears

**Layer 4: Procedural Blocks**
- Standing requirements
- Judicial notice doctrine
- "Frivolous" dismissals

## YOUR POWER POINTS

### Where You Have Maximum Leverage:

1. **At Original Fraud** (Violation Point 1)
   - Demand proof of consideration
   - They can't provide it

2. **At Credit Reporting** (Violation Point 3)
   - Dispute with agencies
   - Claim peonage/slavery

3. **Before Foreclosure** (Violation Point 6)
   - File criminal complaints
   - Demand prosecution

4. **In Court** (Violation Point 7)
   - Raise criminal violations
   - Demand discovery

---

## THE CRITICAL REALIZATION

Every step after your signature is a criminal violation because:
1. **You already paid** with your promissory note
2. **Bank gave no consideration** for further payments
3. **Entire process is extortion** without legal basis
4. **System operates through organized crime** (RICO)

**Your promissory note WAS the payment. Everything else is theft.**
