## 🎯 NEGOTIATION SCRIPT

### Initial Approach:

"I'm facing financial hardship and cannot continue making payments. Rather than going through costly foreclosure proceedings, I'm willing to deed the property back to you in exchange for full satisfaction of the debt and specific protections we can negotiate."

### Key Points to Make:

1. **Mutual Benefit**
   - "This saves you foreclosure costs"
   - "Property maintained better"
   - "Faster resolution for both"

2. **Your Needs**
   - "I need time to relocate"
   - "I need moving assistance"
   - "I need credit protection"

3. **Leverage**
   - "I've documented loan origination issues"
   - "Foreclosure will be contested"
   - "Property may deteriorate in foreclosure"

### Responses to Pressure:

- **"Sign today or deal's off"**
  → "I need time for attorney review"

- **"We can't waive deficiency"**
  → "Then I'll defend foreclosure"

- **"Take it or leave it"**
  → "I'll explore other options"
