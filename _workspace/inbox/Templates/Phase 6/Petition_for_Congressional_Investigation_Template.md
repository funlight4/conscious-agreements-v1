## ⚠️ URGENT: MILLIONS OF AMERICANS FACING ILLEGAL FORECLOSURE

---

## TO THE HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS

We, the undersigned citizens of the United States of America, hereby petition Congress to immediately initiate a comprehensive investigation into systemic fraud in mortgage lending, the deceptive practices of money creation by banks, and the resulting illegal foreclosures affecting millions of American families.

**WHEREAS,** Federal Reserve publications including "Modern Money Mechanics" openly admit that banks do not lend depositors' money but instead create new money through accounting entries when making loans; and

**WHEREAS,** the Bank of England has confirmed in official publications that "Whenever a bank makes a loan, it simultaneously creates a matching deposit in the borrower's bank account, thereby creating new money"; and

**WHEREAS,** banks systematically fail to disclose to borrowers that their promissory notes are recorded as assets and used to create the very money allegedly "lent" to them; and

**WHEREAS,** this practice violates fundamental contract law requiring consideration, as banks provide nothing of value they possessed before the transaction; and

**WHEREAS,** 12 U.S.C. § 411 still requires Federal Reserve Notes to be "redeemed in lawful money on demand," creating a legal paradox since the abandonment of the gold standard in 1971; and

**WHEREAS,** millions of American families have lost their homes through foreclosures based on fraudulent claims of debt that may be legally void for lack of consideration; and

**WHEREAS,** the securitization of mortgages has created multiple fraudulent claims on the same properties, with notes being sold multiple times in violation of basic property law; and

**WHEREAS,** former Federal Reserve attorney Walker F. Todd has provided sworn testimony that what banks call "loans" are actually purchases of promissory notes through bookkeeping entries, not loans of pre-existing money;

## THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE ANSWERS

For too long, the American people have been deceived about the nature of money and debt. We have been told we are borrowers when we are actually the creators of money through our signatures. We have been threatened with foreclosure for failing to repay "loans" that were never loans at all.

This is not a partisan issue. This affects Democrats, Republicans, and Independents alike. Every American with a mortgage has been deceived. Every American who has lost their home to foreclosure may have been illegally dispossessed.

The evidence is clear, documented in the Federal Reserve's own publications and confirmed by banking insiders. What is lacking is the political will to confront this massive fraud. We call upon Congress to fulfill its constitutional duty to regulate money and protect the American people from systematic exploitation.
