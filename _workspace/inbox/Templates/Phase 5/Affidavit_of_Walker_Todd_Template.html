            <div class="numbered-item" data-number="1">
                <p>I am over 18 years of age and competent to testify. I have personal knowledge of the matters stated herein.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="numbered-item" data-number="2">
                <p>I worked as an attorney for the Federal Reserve System for over 20 years, including positions at the Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland (1985-1994) and New York (1994-1998).

        <div class="section">
            <h2>EXPERT OPINION ON MONEY CREATION</h2>
            
            <div class="numbered-item" data-number="4">
                <p><strong>Banks Do Not Lend Their Own Money or Depositors' Money.</strong> It is a common misconception that banks lend out their depositors' money or their own capital. This is categorically false. When a bank makes a loan, it creates new money through accounting entries.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="numbered-item" data-number="5">
                <p><strong>The Loan Creation Process.</strong> When a borrower signs a promissory note, the bank does the following:</p>
                <ol style="margin-left: 20px;">
                    <li>Records the promissory note as an asset on its books</li>
                    <li>Creates a matching deposit liability in the borrower's account</li>
                    <li>The deposit is new money that did not exist before</li>
                    <li>No money is transferred from any existing account</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            
            <div class="numbered-item" data-number="6">
                <p><strong>Federal Reserve Confirmation.</strong> The Federal Reserve has publicly acknowledged this process. In their publication "Modern Money Mechanics," they state: <em>"Of course, banks do not really pay out loans from the money they receive as deposits. If they did this, no additional money would be created."</em></p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="numbered-item" data-number="7">
                <p><strong>No Consideration Provided.</strong> In the traditional sense of contract law, the bank provides no consideration for the borrower's promissory note. The bank does not give up anything of value that it possessed before the transaction. Instead, it monetizes the borrower's promise to pay.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>THE BORROWER'S PROMISSORY NOTE</h2>
            
            <div class="numbered-item" data-number="8">
                <p><strong>The Note as the Source of Funds.</strong> The borrower's promissory note is not merely evidence of a debt. It is the actual source of the funds that appear to be "loaned" to the borrower. The borrower's signature creates the value.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="numbered-item" data-number="9">
                <p><strong>Accounting Treatment.</strong> Under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), the bank must record the promissory note as an asset. Simultaneously, it creates a deposit liability. This is not a loan in any traditional sense - it is an exchange of assets.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="numbered-item" data-number="10">
                <p><strong>The Deception.</strong> Banks do not disclose to borrowers that:</p>
                <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                    <li>The borrower's signature creates the money</li>
                    <li>No pre-existing money is lent</li>
                    <li>The bank risks nothing of its own</li>
                    <li>The promissory note will be sold or securitized</li>
                    <li>The transaction is an exchange, not a loan</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>LEGAL IMPLICATIONS</h2>
            
            <div class="numbered-item" data-number="11">
                <p><strong>Lack of Full Disclosure.</strong> The failure to disclose the true nature of the transaction constitutes a material omission that voids informed consent. Borrowers cannot make informed decisions without understanding that they are creating the money, not borrowing it.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="numbered-item" data-number="12">
                <p><strong>Consideration in Contract Law.</strong> A valid contract requires consideration - something of value given by each party. Since the bank gives nothing of value that it possessed before the transaction, there is arguably no valid consideration, which would void the contract.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="numbered-item" data-number="13">
                <p><strong>RICO Implications.</strong> The systematic nature of this deception across the banking industry, combined with the use of mail and wire communications to perpetrate it, potentially constitutes a pattern of racketeering activity under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>SECURITIZATION AND MERS</h2>
            
            <div class="numbered-item" data-number="14">
                <p><strong>Separation of Note and Mortgage.</strong> It is a fundamental principle of mortgage law that the note and mortgage must remain together. When banks securitize loans through MERS (Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems) or otherwise, they often separate the note from the mortgage, which voids the security interest.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="numbered-item" data-number="15">
                <p><strong>Multiple Sales.</strong> Through securitization, the same promissory note is often sold multiple times to different investors. This is securities fraud and creates competing claims that cloud title.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="numbered-item" data-number="16">
                <p><strong>Destruction of Original Notes.</strong> To hide the multiple sales and the true nature of the transactions, original promissory notes are routinely destroyed. Banks then claim the notes are "lost" when challenged to produce them.</p>

            <h2>FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS</h2>
            
            <div class="numbered-item" data-number="17">
                <p><strong>The Discount Window.</strong> Banks can take borrowers' promissory notes to the Federal Reserve's discount window and exchange them for Federal Reserve Notes (currency). This proves that promissory notes have monetary value and are treated as money by the Federal Reserve System.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="numbered-item" data-number="18">
                <p><strong>Fractional Reserve Lending.</strong> Through fractional reserve banking, banks can lend many times more than their deposits. A promissory note for $100,000 can result in the creation of $900,000 or more in new money through the multiplier effect.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="numbered-item" data-number="19">
                <p><strong>Interest on Created Money.</strong> Banks charge interest on money they create from nothing. The borrower must repay not only the principal (which the borrower created) but also interest, which requires obtaining money created by other borrowers' debts. This makes systemic debt mathematically inevitable.</p>

            <h2>SPECIFIC CASE APPLICATION</h2>
            
            <div class="numbered-item" data-number="20">
                <p>Based on my review of the documents in this case involving <input type="text" class="form-field" placeholder="Your Name" style="width: 200px;"> and <input type="text" class="form-field" placeholder="Bank Name" style="width: 200px;">, it is my expert opinion that:</p>
                <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                    <li>The bank provided no lawful consideration for the promissory note</li>
                    <li>The money was created from the borrower's signature</li>
                    <li>The true nature of the transaction was not disclosed</li>
                    <li>The mortgage/deed of trust is void for lack of consideration</li>
                    <li>The bank cannot demonstrate any actual loss if the loan is not repaid</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="numbered-item" data-number="21">
                <p><strong>Industry-Wide Practice.</strong> These practices are not unique to this bank. They represent standard operating procedure throughout the banking industry. This systemic fraud has resulted in the largest transfer of wealth in human history.</p>

            <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
            
            <div class="numbered-item" data-number="22">
                <p>It is my professional opinion, based on my decades of experience within the Federal Reserve System and my extensive study of banking practices, that what is commonly called a "loan" is not a loan at all. It is the purchase of a promissory note by creating bookkeeping entries. The borrower is the creditor, and the bank is the debtor in the initial transaction.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="numbered-item" data-number="23">
                <p>The entire mortgage system, as currently practiced, is based on deception, lack of disclosure, and absence of real consideration. Courts that allow foreclosures without requiring proof of consideration are enabling this fraud.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="numbered-item" data-number="24">
                <p>I am available to testify in court regarding these matters and to answer any questions about banking practices, money creation, and the Federal Reserve System.</p>
