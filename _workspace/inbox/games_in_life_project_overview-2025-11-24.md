# Games in Life Project - Comprehensive Overview
## A Framework for Understanding Societal Systems Through Game Theory

---

## Project Mission

To research, document, and educate about the multiple "games" operating in human society - particularly legal/lawful systems - enabling conscious participation through understanding rather than unconscious subjection through ignorance.

---

## Core Thesis

Human society operates through multiple overlapping "games," each with distinct:
- **Rules** (laws, codes, customs)
- **Players** (citizens, officials, entities)
- **Language** (terminology with game-specific meanings)
- **Entry/Exit Points** (how one enters or leaves each game)
- **Hierarchies** (which games override others)

Most people participate unconsciously in games they don't understand, using language they think they comprehend, bound by rules they never learned, creating obligations they didn't knowingly accept.

---

## The Problem We're Solving

### The Current Situation:
1. **Multiple Games Exist** - Natural law, common law, legal systems, commercial law, etc.
2. **People Don't Know** - Which game they're in or that multiple games exist
3. **Language Barriers** - Same words mean different things in different games
4. **Unconscious Participation** - People enter games without knowing
5. **No Education** - These games aren't taught despite being mandatory
6. **Enforced Ignorance** - Helping others understand can be illegal (unauthorized practice)

### The Result:
- Uninformed consent
- Unconscious obligations
- Surprise consequences
- System advantages for the informed
- Perpetual confusion

## Key Principles

### 1. Truth Seeking
- We seek truth ABOUT law/games, not truth IN them
- Objective observation over subjective interpretation
- Documentation over speculation
- Patterns over anecdotes

### 2. Open Source Approach
- Transparent research methods
- Shared findings
- Collaborative verification
- Community contribution
- Public benefit focus

### 3. Safety First
- Education before action
- Understanding before implementation
- Low-risk testing only
- Clear risk assessment
- Harm prevention priority

### 4. Role Clarity
We operate as:
- **Researchers** - Investigating how games work
- **Educators** - Teaching what we learn
- **Translators** - Converting between game languages
- **Documentarians** - Recording patterns and outcomes

We do NOT operate as:
- Legal advisors
- Representatives
- Advocates
- Guarantors

## Game Hierarchy Model

```
REALITY LAYERS:

Physical Reality (Natural Laws - Gravity, Thermodynamics)
    ↓
Natural Law (Universal Principles - Inherent Rights)
    ↓
Common Law (Cultural Customs - Traditions, Precedents)
    ↓
Constitutional (Foundational Agreements - Basic Framework)
    ↓
Legal System (Statutory Rules - Legislative Enactments)
    ↓
Administrative (Regulatory Details - Agency Rules)
    ↓
Contract Law (Private Agreements - Individual Contracts)
```

**Key Principle**: Lower games cannot legitimately override higher games

---

## Current Focus Areas

### 1. The Person/Individual Distinction
- How different games define identity
- Entry points through identity assumptions
- Legal person vs natural person dynamics

### 2. Consent Mechanisms
- Informed vs uninformed consent
- Presumed consent through action
- Silent consent through non-objection
- Consent defects and remedies

### 3. Language Translation
- Common English vs Legalese
- Context-dependent definitions
- Historical meaning evolution
- Cross-game terminology

### 4. Jurisdiction Triggers
- What creates jurisdiction
- How games claim authority
- Overlapping jurisdictions
- Jurisdiction challenges

### 5. Entry/Exit Points
- Common entry triggers
- Unconscious entry patterns
- Exit possibilities
- Status corrections

## Final Thought

*"The truth about law isn't that it doesn't apply - it's understanding how, when, why, and by what authority it applies, and what choices that understanding reveals."*

By mapping the games, translating the languages, and documenting the patterns, we enable conscious participation in the systems that govern our lives. This is not about winning or losing, but about understanding the games we're already playing.
