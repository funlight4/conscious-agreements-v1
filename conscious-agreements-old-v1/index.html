                <h2>The Core Reframe</h2>

                <p>What appears as immutable "law" is often <strong>agreement</strong>. Statutes, regulations, contracts, citizenship, jurisdiction — nearly all of it rests on some form of consent, whether explicit or implied, conscious or unconscious.</p>

                <p>The problem isn't that agreements exist. The problem is that most people don't know they're in them.</p>

                    <p>This framework is for <strong>education and awareness</strong>, not legal advice. Understanding agreements doesn't mean escaping all obligations. The goal is <strong>conscious choice</strong> — knowing what you've agreed to and having clarity about your options.</p>

                <p>If you're new to this framework, begin with <a href="/foundation/">Foundation</a>. Read through the core concepts before exploring specific domains or practical pathways. The reframe needs to land first — then everything else becomes navigable.</p>
