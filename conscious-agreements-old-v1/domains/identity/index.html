                <h2>Why Identity Matters</h2>

                <p>Agreements require parties. Before you can be bound by an agreement, there must be clarity about who "you" are in that agreement. The legal system has specific definitions that may differ from common understanding:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>"Person"</strong> often includes corporations and entities, not just humans</li>
                    <li><strong>"Individual"</strong> in some contexts means a type of business entity</li>
                    <li><strong>Your name</strong> may refer to a legal entity separate from you</li>
                    <li><strong>Citizenship</strong> determines which jurisdiction's laws apply</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="important-box">
                    <div class="important-box__title">A Word of Caution</div>
                    <p>The identity framework presented here includes theories that have had mixed reception in courts. Some judges accept aspects of these arguments; many dismiss them as "sovereign citizen" theories.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">The value is in <strong>understanding</strong> — seeing how the system defines and addresses you — rather than assuming these concepts will automatically succeed as legal defenses.</p>

                <h2>Foundation Concepts</h2>

                <p>Before exploring Identity, ensure you understand:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><a href="/foundation/what-is-agreement.html">What Is an Agreement?</a> — The elements required</li>
                    <li><a href="/foundation/conscious-unconscious.html">Conscious vs. Unconscious</a> — How agreements form</li>
                    <li><a href="/reference/terminology.html">Terminology</a> — Key legal definitions</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Identity connects to Commerce through <a href="/domains/commerce/signatures-and-liability.html">signatures and liability</a> — how you sign determines which "you" is obligated.</p>
