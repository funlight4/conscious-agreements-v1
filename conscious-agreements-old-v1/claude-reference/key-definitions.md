# Key Definitions

Critical terms from Black's Law Dictionary 4th Edition that differ significantly from common usage. Reference this before making assumptions about meaning.

## Most Critical Terms

### PERSON
**Common usage:** A human being, an individual  
**Legal meaning:** A legal entity; may refer to a natural person (human) OR artificial person (corporation, trust, etc.). Often used to mean the legal fiction/status rather than the living man or woman.

> "A 'person' is such, not because he is human, but because rights and duties are ascribed to him."

When a statute or document uses "person," verify whether it means human being or legal entity.

---

### CITIZEN
**Common usage:** Inhabitant, resident, member of society  
**Legal meaning:** One who owes allegiance to a government and is entitled to its protection. Implies a reciprocal relationship with duties attached.

> "Citizens are members of a political community who, in their associated capacity, have established or submitted themselves to the dominion of a government for the promotion of their general welfare and the protection of their individual as well as their collective rights."

Citizenship is an agreement with obligations, not merely a geographic fact.

---

### RESIDENT
**Common usage:** Where someone lives  
**Legal meaning:** One who has a residence in a place; implies certain jurisdictional connections and potentially tax status. Different from domicile.

> "The place where a man's habitation is fixed, without any present intention of removing therefrom."

Claiming residence may create jurisdictional hooks you didn't intend.

---

### UNDERSTAND
**Common usage:** To comprehend, to grasp meaning  
**Legal meaning:** To "stand under" — can imply submission to authority or agreement to jurisdiction.

> "Do you understand the charges against you?" may be asking: "Do you stand under this court's authority?"

Be cautious with this word in legal contexts. "I comprehend" or "I am aware of your position" may be safer.

---

### MUST
**Common usage:** Mandatory requirement  
**Legal meaning:** Often means "may" — particularly in statutory language. Context determines whether mandatory or permissive.

> "When used in a statute, the word 'must' is not always imperative and may be construed as merely directory."

Don't assume "must" means "must" in legal documents.

---

### INCLUDES / INCLUDING
**Common usage:** Contains, encompasses (expansive)  
**Legal meaning:** Often limiting — may mean "is limited to" rather than "contains but is not limited to"

> "The terms 'includes' and 'including' do not exclude things not enumerated which are in the same general class."

BUT: In definitions, "includes" often limits rather than expands. "The term 'person' includes corporations" may mean person = corporations (for this statute's purposes), not person = humans + corporations.

---

### CONSIDERATION
**Common usage:** Thought, contemplation  
**Legal meaning:** Something of value exchanged between parties to a contract. Essential for valid contract.

> "The inducement to a contract. The cause, motive, price, or impelling influence which induces a contracting party to enter into a contract."

No consideration = no valid contract. One-sided "agreements" are not enforceable contracts.

---

### CONSENT
**Common usage:** Agreement, permission  
**Legal meaning:** Agreement to something proposed by another. Can be express or implied. Implied consent is created through action or inaction.

> "A concurrence of wills. Consent is an act of reason, accompanied with deliberation, the mind weighing as in a balance the good and evil on each side."

Silence can be construed as consent. Behavior can imply consent. This is how unconscious agreements form.

---

### JURISDICTION
**Common usage:** Area or domain  
**Legal meaning:** The authority to act; the power of a court or government entity to affect rights and obligations.

> "The power and authority constitutionally conferred upon a court or judge to pronounce the sentence of the law."

Jurisdiction requires establishment. Without proper jurisdiction, authority doesn't properly exist. This can be challenged (though carefully).

---

## Other Important Terms

### STATUTE
An act of legislature declaring, commanding, or prohibiting something. Statutes apply to those within their jurisdiction who have agreed (consciously or not) to their application.

### CODE
A systematic collection of laws. Not necessarily the same as law itself — may be administrative rules applicable to specific classes.

### OBLIGATION
A duty to do or not do something. In contract, arises from the agreement of parties. Question whether obligation arose from valid agreement.

### LIABILITY
The state of being bound in law and justice to do something. Requires valid basis — often a contract or tort.

### LEGAL
Conforming to law; according to law. "Legal" doesn't mean "lawful" — legal refers to system compliance; lawful refers to natural law/rights.

### LAWFUL
In accordance with law; not forbidden by law; permitted by law. Broader than "legal" — includes natural law considerations.

### TITLE
The means whereby the owner of lands has the just possession of his property. Title is not the same as property itself — it's the evidence of ownership.

### TRUST
A right of property, real or personal, held by one party for the benefit of another. Many legal structures operate through trust mechanisms.
