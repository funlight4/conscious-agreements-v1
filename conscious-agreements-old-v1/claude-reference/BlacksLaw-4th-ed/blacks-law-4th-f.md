belief in it. Crabbe, Syn. The word implies fraud or false-
hood; a false or fraudulent concoction, knowing it to be
wrong. L, R. 10 Q.B. 162.

cumstances or indicia, after the fact committed, with the
purpose of using them as evidence, and of deceitfully mak-
ing them appear as if accidental or undesigned; to devise
falsely or contrive by artifice with the intention to deceive.
Such evidence may be wholly forged and artificial, or it
may consist in so warping and distorting real facts as to
create an erroneous impression in the minds of those who
observe them and then presenting such impression as true
and genuine.

## FABRICATED EVIDENCE

coincide, as "face" is used in contradistinction to

indictment and the verdict. Jones v. State, 58 Ga.App. 374,
198 S.E. 566.

## FACT

A thing done; an action performed or an
incident transpiring; an event or circumstance;
an actual occurrence. An actual happening in
time or space or an event mental or physical.
Fowler-Curtis Co. v. Dean, 203 App.Div. 317, 196
N.Y.S. 750, 754; German-American Ins. Co. v.

sler, 267 App.Div. 686, 49 N.Y.S.2d 97, 99. That
which has taken place, not what might or might
626, 182 P. 368, 371.
A fact is either a state of things, that is, an existence, or
a motion, that is, an event. 1 Benth.Jud.Ev. 48.
Fact (factum, fait) stands in lawbooks for : 1. An act;
2. For a completed and operative transaction brought
about by sealing and executing a certain sort of writing,
and so for the instrument itself, a deed (factuin); 3. As
designating what exists, in contradistinction to what should
exist (de facto as contrasted with de jure); 4. As indicat-
ing things, events, actions, conditions, as happening, exist-
ing, really taking place. Thayer, Evid. 190.
"Fact" was formerly used almost exclusively in the sense
of "action" or "deed." This usage survives in phrases
such as "accessory before the fact."
As used in statute providing that malice shall be pre-
sumed from publication of matter not privileged, unless
the "fact" and the testimony rebut such presumption,
means the act, the thing done, the circumstance, the pub-
lication itself. Reininger v. Prickett, 192 Okl. 486, 137 P.2d
595, 597.
As used in statute requiring statement of facts constitut-
ing cause of action, "facts" mean narrative of events, acts,
and things done which show legal liability of defendant to
plaintiff. Rhoads v. Columbia Fire Underwriters' Agency,
128 Neb. 710, 260 N.W. 174.
"Facts" to which Supreme Court is limited on certiorari
to quash Court of Appeals' decision for conflict comprise
record before Court of Appeals, evidence, documentary and
oral, and instructions and pleadings. State ex rel. Hors-
pool v. Haid, 328 Mo. 327, 40 S.W.2d 611, 613.
Good reputation of an accused when proved is a "fact".
State v., Fenimore, 3 Terry 183, 29 A.2d 170, 171. Intent is
a "fact". Majestic Securities Corporation v. Commissioner
of Internal Revenue, C.C.A.8, 120 F.2d 12, 14. "Knowl-
edge" is a "fact", and an "assertion of knowledge", when
knowledge does not exist, is an assertion not in accordance
with the facts. Eastern States Petroleum Co. v. Universal
Oil Products Co., 24 Del.Ch. 11, 3 A.2d 768, 775. Represen-
tations as to boundaries of land are representations of
"fact". Algee v. Hillman Inv. Co., 12 Wash.2d 672, 123
P.2d 332, 334. Where knowledge is possible, one who repre-
sents a mere belief as knowledge misrepresents a "fact",
Sovereign Pocohontas Co. v. Bond, 74 App.D.C. 175, 120
F.2d 39, 40.
Law and Fact as Distinguishable
"Fact" is very frequently used in opposition or
contrast to "law."
Thus, questions of fact are for the jury; questions of
law for the court. So an attorney at law is an officer of the
courts of justice; an attorney in fact is appointed by the
written authorization of a principal to manage business
affairs usually not professional. Fraud in fact consists in
an actual intention to defraud, carried into effect; while
fraud imputed by law arises from the man's conduct in its
necessary relations and consequences.
A "fact", as distinguished from the "law", may be taken
as that out of which the point of law arises, that which is
asserted to be or not to be, and is to be presumed or
proved to be or not to be for the purpose of applying or
refusing to apply a rule of law. Hinckley v. Town of
Barnstable, 311 Mass. 600, 42 N.E.2d 581, 584.
Law is a principle; fact is an event. Law is conceived;
fact is actual. Law is a rule of duty; fact is that which
has been according to or in contravention of the rule. The
distinction Is well illustrated in the rule that the existence
of foreign laws is matter of fact. Within the territory of
its jurisdiction, law operates as an obligatory rule which
judges must recognize and enforce; but, in a tribunal out-
side that jurisdiction, it loses its obligatory force and its
claim to judicial notice. The fact that it exists, if impor-
tant to the rights of parties, must be alleged and proved
the same as the actual existence of any other institution.
Abbott.
Law of Evidence
A circumstance, event or occurrence as it actual..
ly takes or took place; a physical object or ap-
pearance, as it actually exists or existed. An ac-
tual and absolute reality, as distinguished from
mere supposition or opinion; a truth, as distin-
guished from fiction or error. Burrill, Circ.Ev. 218.
"Circumstances" are but minor facts, Scott v. State, 57
Ga.App. 489, 195 S.E. 923, 924. Facts admitted upon trial
of cause become "evidence". American Extension School
of Law v. Ragland, 232 Mo.App. 763, 112 S.W.2d 110, 113.
Facts judicially noticed are equivalent to evidence. Zicke-
foose v. Thompson, 347 Mo. 579, 148 S.W.2d 784, 792.
"Facts" and "evidence" are sometimes used interchange-
ably. Mackey v. First Nat. Bank, Mo.App., 293 S.W. 66, 71.
But the terms are not really synonymous; evidence,
broadly defined, being means from which an inference may
logically be drawn as to existence of a fact. Tjernstrom
v. Ford Motor Co., 285 Mich. 450, 280 N.W. 823, 825. Yet,
although "facts" and the "evidence" are quite different, it
sometimes may happen that they constitute one and the
same thing. Gates v. Haw, 150 Ind. 370, 50 N.E. 299.
Hypothetical question propounded to plaintiff's witness in
which an assumed fact was that a test made by another
expert had a specified result referred to a "fact" and not an
"opinion" of the expert. Cody v. Toiler Drug Co., 232
Iowa 475, 5 N.W.2d 824, 828.
In rule 41(b), providing for motion for dismissal at close
of plaintiff's evidence in nonjury case on ground that upon
the facts and the law plaintiff has shown no right to relief,
the "facts" referred to are the prima facie facts shown by
plaintiff's evidence viewed in light most favorable to him.
Schad v. Twentieth Cehtury-Fox Film Corporation, C.C.A.
Pa., 136 F.2d 991, 993.
Ownership of property is, generally, a "fact" to which
a witness may testify. Diamond v. Grath, 46 Cal.App.2d
443, 116 P.2d 114, 116.
Statement that cause of death was a gunshot wound was
a statement of "fact" but further statements ,,that such
wound was self-inflicted and that death was suicide were
mere expressions of "opinion". Kentucky Home Mut. Life
Ins. Co. v. Watts, 298 Ky. 471, 183 S.W.2d 499, 502.
Where person states matter which might otherwise be
only an "opinion" as an existing fact material to the
transaction, the statement clearly becomes a statement of
"fact". Fidelity & Casualty Co. of New York v. J. D. Pitt-
man Tractor Co., 244 Ala. 354, 13 So.2d 669, 672.
Words "facts" and "circumstances" are used inter-
changeably in the phrase circumstantial evidence. Pulliam
v. State, 196 Ga. 782, 28 S.E.2d 139, 147.
Workmen's compensation claimant's testimony that he
was well related to a "fact" and not to an "opinion".
Texas Employers Ins. Ass'n v. Griffis, Tex.Civ.App., 141
S.W.2d 687, 690.
Truth and Fact Distinguished
The terms "fact" and "truth" are often used in
common parlance as synonymous, but, as em-
ployed in reference to pleading, they are widely
different. A fact in pleading is a circumstance,
act, event, or incident; a truth is the legal princi-
ple which declares or governs the facts and their
operative effect. Admitting the facts stated in a
complaint, the truth may be that the plaintiff is not
entitled, upon the face of his complaint, to what he
claims. The mode in which a defendant sets up
that truth for his protection is a demurrer. Drake
v. Cockroft, 4 E. D. Smith, N.Y., 37.

dentiary Facts," "Finding of Fact," "Immaterial

agency. Neild v. District of Columbia, 71 App.D.C. 306, 110
F.2d 246, 259.

agency is a limited one. Falls Rubber Co. v. La Fon, Tex.
Civ.App., 256 S.W. 577, 579.
An agent employed to sell goods for principal, The Robin

Broker and Factor Distinguished
A factor differs from a "broker" in that he is in-
trusted with the possession, management, and con-
trol of the goods, (which gives him a special prop-
erty in them,) ; while a broker acts as a mere in-
termediary without control or possession of the
property. A factor may buy and sell in his own
name, as well as in that of the principal, while a
broker, as such, cannot ordinarily buy or sell in
his own name. Commercial Inv. Trust v. Stewart,
235 Mich. 502, 209 N.W. 660, 661; Sutton &
Cummins v. Kiel Cheese & Butter Co., 155 Ky.

Tobacco Co. v. Corry, 103 Fla. 217, 137 So. 255, 257.
A factor or commission merchant has a lien
upon the goods for his charges, advances, and
commissions, while the broker has no control of
the property and is responsible only for bad faith.
McCornick & Co., Bankers v. Tolmie Bros., 42
Idaho 1, 243 P. 355, 358.
A factor or commission merchant is one who has the
actual or technical possession of goods or wares of another
for sale. A "merchandise broker" is one who negotiates
the sale of merchandise without having it in his possession
or control. He is simply an agent with very limited pow-
ers, J. M. Robinson, Norton & Co. v. Cotton Factory, 124
Ky. 435, 99 S.W. 305, 102 S.W. 869, 8 L.R.A.,N.S., 474.
Commission Merchants and Factors
as Synonymous
Factors are also frequently called "commission
merchants;" and it is said that there is no dif-
ference in the meaning of these terms, the latter
being perhaps more commonly used in America.
Thompson v. Woodruff, 7 Cold. 410; Duguid v.
Edwards, 50 Barb., N.Y., 288; Lyon v. Alvord, 18
Conn. 80. See, also, Commission Merchant.
Domestic and Foreign Factors
Factors are called "domestic" or "foreign" ac-
cording as they reside and do business in the same
state or country with the principal or in a different
state or country.
A domestic factor is sometimes called a "home" factor.
Ruffner v. Hewitt, 7 W.Va. 585; 1 Term 112; 4 Maule & S.
A "foreign factor," as understood in marine matters, was
a person who had charge of the cargo to handle it, dispose
of it, convert it into money, or exchange it for other prop-
erty, but who had nothing to do with the management of
the boat when he sailed thereon, at which time he was
called a "supercargo." Gilchrist Transp. Co. v. Worthing-
ton & Sill, 193 App.Div. 250, 184 N.Y.S. 81, 83; Beawes,
Lex Mere. 44; Liverm.Ag. 69; 1 Domat, b. 1, t. 16, § 3,
art. 2.
Judicial Factor
In Scotch law. A factor appointed by the courts
in certain cases where it becomes necessary to in-
trust the management of property to another
than the owner, as, where the latter is insane or
imbecile or the infant heir of a decedent.
Supercargo as a Factor
Where an owner of goods to be shipped by sea
consigns them to the care of an agent, who sails
on the same vessel, has charge of the cargo on
board, sells it abroad, and buys a return cargo out
of the proceeds, such agent is strictly and properly
a "factor," though in maritime law and usage he
is commonly called a "supercargo." Beawes, Lex
Merc. 44, 47; Liverm.Ag. 69, 70.

## FACTORAGE

The wages, allowance, or commis-
sion paid to a factor for his services. Winne v.
Hammond, 37 Ill. 103; State v. Thompson, 25 S.W.

tached in the hands of a third person. A term

cut. Otherwise termed "trustee process," "gar-
nishment," and process by "foreign attachment."

40 & 41 Vict. c. 39) by which a factor is enabled to
make a valid pledge of the goods, or of any part
thereof, to one who believes him to be the bona
fide owner of the goods. Similar legislation is
not uncommon in the United States.

an act of inevitable necessity. Taylor v. Mason, 9 Wheat.
344, 6 L.Ed. 101. See Stallings v. Thomas, 55 Ark. 326, 18
S.W. 184; Persons v. Hight, 4 Ga. 497; Maestas v. Ameri-
can Metal Co. of New Mexico, 37 N.M. 203, 20 P.2d 924,
The words "fail to comply," however, have in general
the same operation in law as the words "refuse to com-
ply." Ginnochio v. Hydraulic Press Brick Co., D.C.Ohio,
266 F. 564, 569. And an allegation in an indictment that
defendant "failed and refused" to comply with a statute
should not be expanded to carry the implication that there
was a deliberate, intentional, and inexcusable refusal, es-
pecially where the indictment is not good without such ex-
pansion. Mackey v. U. S., C.C.A.Tenn., 290 F. 18, 21.
The term may imply an inopportunity to act. Worthing-
ton Pump & Machinery Corporation v. City of Cudahy, 182
Wis. 8, 195 N.W. 717.

is, the lack of sufficient assets to pay one's debts.

24 Conn. 310, 63 Am.Dec. 163.

cause, it is unable to pay its debts in the ordinary or
usual course of business, Sanders v. Owens, Mo.App., 47
S.W.2d 132, 134; when in state of uncertainty as to
whether it will be able to sustain itself, depending on
favorable or unfavorable contingencies, over which its
officers have no control. Graf v. Allen, 230 Mo.App. 721, 74
S.W.2d 61, 66.

## FAILING OF RECORD

When an action is
brought against a person who alleges in his plea
matter of record in bar of the action, and avers to
prove it by the record, but the plaintiff saith nul
tiel record, viz., denies there is any such record,
upon which the defendant has a day given him
by the court to bring it in, if he fail to do it,
then he is said to fail of his record, and the plain-
tiff is entitled to sign judgment. Termes de la
FAILLITE. In French law. Bankruptcy; fail-
ure; the situation of a debtor who finds himself
unable to fulfill his engagements. Code de Com.
arts. 442, 580; Civil Code La. art. 3556, No. 11; 3

N.E. 783. Lapse. Wilmington Trust Co. v. Wil-
mington Trust Co., 25 Del.Ch. 204, 15 A.2d 830,
834. See, also, Fail.
As used in municipal charter concerning "failure" to fill
certain office by certain methods, the term presupposes
efforts that had proved fruitless, and demands a bona fide

Suitor, 103 Vt. 175, 152 A. 801, 802.
Discontinuance of business from insolvency, bankruptcy,
or the like. State v. Thompson, 333 Mo. 1069, 64 S.W.2d

pare, however, In re Green, 192 Cal. 714, 221 P. 903, 905.
But to constitute a statutory offense, such as the failure
to work on public roads, the term may imply willfulness
and the absence of sufficient excuse. Jones v. State, 7 Ala.
App. 180, 62 So. 306, 307.

## FAILURE OF CONSIDERATION

As applied to
notes, contracts, conveyances, etc., this term
does not mean a want of consideration, but implies
that a consideration, originally existing and good,
has since become worthless or has ceased to exist
or been extinguished, partially or entirely. Shirk
v. Neible, 156 Ind. 66, 59 N.E. 281, 83 Am.St.Rep.
150; Williamson v. Cline, 40 W.Va. 194, 20 S.E.
It means that sufficient consideration was contemplated
by the parties at time contract was entered into, but either
on account of some innate defect in the thing to be given or
nonperformance in whole or in part of that which the
promisee agreed to do or forbear nothing of value can be
or is received by the promisee. Holcomb v. Long Beach
Inv. Co., 129 Cal.App. 285, 19 P.2d 31, 36.
been given without fault of the party contracting to give it.
Edmund D. Cook, Inc. v. Commercial Casualty Ins. Co., 15
N.J.Misc. 256, 190 A. 99, 101.
"Fraud" cannot be pleaded as defense to note on ground
that it amounts to "failure of consideration." Fraud is in.
Its essence a tort, while "failure of consideration" ordi-
narily involves no actionable wrong, but occurs by reason
of accident or mistake. Kothmann v. Southwest Co., Tex.
Civ.App., 92 S.W.2d 272, 276.
Want of consideration as synonymous or distinguishable
"Failure of consideration" is in fact simply a want of
consideration. Farrell v. Third Nat. Bank, 20 Tenn.App.
540, 101 S.W.2d 158, 163.
"Want of consideration" embraces transactions or
instances where no consideration was intended to pass
while "failure of consideration" implies that a valuable
consideration moving from obligee to obligor was con-
templated. In re Conrad's Estate, 333 Pa. 561, 3 A.2d 697,
699; Rauschenbach v. McDaniel's Estate, 122 W.Va. 632,
11 S.E.2d 852, 854.
There is "want of consideration" when nothing of value
has ever been received, and "failure of consideration"
where something of value was originally received which
has since lost its value. Columbia Restaurant v. Sadnovick,
La.App., 157 So. 280, 282.

## FAILURE OF EVIDENCE

Judicially speaking,
a total "failure of evidence" means not only the
utter absence of all evidence, but it also means a
failure to offer proof, either positive or inferen-
tial, to establish one or more of the many facts,
the establishment of all of which is indispensable
to the finding of the issue for the plaintiff. Cole
v. Hebb, 7 Gill & J., Md., 28.

## FAILURE OF GOOD BEHAVIOR

Enumerated
in statute as ground for removal of a civil service
employee means behavior contrary to recognized
standards of propriety and morality, misconduct
or wrong conduct. State ex rel. Ashbaugh v.
Bahr, 68 Ohio App. 308, 40 N.E.2d 677, 680, 682.

## FAILURE OF ISSUE

The failure at a fixed time,
or the total extinction, of issue to take an estate
limited over by an executory devise. A definite
failure of issue is when a precise time is fixed by
the will for the failure of issue, as in the case
where there is a devise to one, but if he dies with-
out issue or lawful issue living at the time of his
death, etc. An indefinite failure of issue is the
period when the issue or descendants of the first
taker shall become extinct, and when there is no
longer any issue of the issue of the grantee, with-
out reference to any particular time or any par-
ticular event. 4 Kent, Comm. 275; Huxford v.
Milligan, 50 Ind. 546; Parkhurst v. Harrower, 142
Pa. 432, 21 A. 826, 24 Am.St.Rep. 507; Woodlief

## FAILURE OF JUSTICE

The defeat of a partic-
ular right, or the failure of reparation for a par-
ticular wrong, from the lack or inadequacy of a
legal remedy for the enforcement of the one or
the redress of the other. The term is also collo-
quially applied to the miscarriage of justice which
occurs when the result of a trial is so palpably
wrong as to shock the moral sense.

## FAILURE OF PROOF

In this phrase, the word
"failure" is of broader significance than either
"want" or "lack." State v. Davis, 154 La. 295, 97
A "failure of proof"' consists in failure to prove the
cause of action or defense in its entire scope and mean-
ing. Breslin-Grifiltt Carpet Co. v. Asadorian, Mo.App., 145
S.W.2d 494, 496.
An omission of a material fact from special finding is
deemed a "failure of proof". Kelley, Glover & Vale v.
Heitman, 220 Ind. 625, 44 N.E.2d 981, 984.
As used in a statute authorizing dismissal of suit with-
out prejudice on account of failure of proof, the term does
not mean failure to convince the court by preponderance
of evidence, but failure to make prima facie case. Crim v.
Thompson, 112 Or. 399, 229 P. 916, 920; Wolke v. Schmidt,
112 Or. 99, 228 P. 921, 923.
Under a statute pertaining to variance, a "failure of
proof" results when the evidence offered so far departs
from the cause of action pleaded that it may be said fairly
that the allegations of the pleading in their general scope
and meaning are unproved. Chealey v. Purdy, 54 Mont.
489, 171 P. 926, 927; Nelson v. Dowgiallo, 73 Or. 342, 143
P. 924, 925.
Where evidence is such as would support either of two
contradictory inferences, or presumptions, respecting the
ultimate facts, there is a "failure of proof". Muesenfechter
v. St. Louis Car Co., Mo.App., 139 S.W.2d 1102, 1106.
Where time is not of essence of offense, showing that
crime, which information alleged was committed "on or
about" certain day, was committed on next day, was not a
failure of proof, even had words "on or about" been omit-
ted. State v. Woodall, Mo., 300 S.W. 712, 713.

## FAILURE OF RECORD

Failure of the defend-
ant to produce a record which he has alleged and

defeated without a trial upon the merits. Kim-
berlin v. Stoley, 49 Ohio App. 1, 194 N.E. 885.

## FAILURE TO ACT

Under statute setting up
system of classification of offices and giving in-
cumbent right to an administrative appeal in case
of any failure to act by officers in charge of the

ferred to duties in connection with classification
of offices. Dolan v. Suffolk County, 310 Mass.
318, 37 N.E.2d 998, 1000.

## FAILURE TO BARGAIN COLLECTIVELY

An
employer's refusal to discuss with union, as em-
ployees' bargaining agency, questions involving
conditions of employment and interpretation of
contract constituted a "failure to bargain collec-
tively" with union. Rapid Roller Co. v. National
Labor Relations Board, C.C.A.7, 126 F.2d 452, 459.

## FAILURE TO COOPERATE

## FAILURE TO LOOK

A failure to see an object
within range of vision is equivalent. Brooks v.
City of Ste. Genevieve, Mo.App., 164 S.W.2d 164,
FAILURE TO MAKE DELIVERY. Misdelivery
is "failure to make delivery". Coos Bay Amuse-
ment Co. v. American Ry. Express Co., 129 Or.
216, 277 P. 107, 109. Nondelivery is "failure to
make delivery". Mt. Arbor Nurseries v. American
Ry. Express Co., 221 Mo.App. 241, 300 S.W. 1051,
1053. This phrase is fully adequate to cover all
cases where delivery has not been made as re-
quired. Kahn v. American Railway Express Co.,
88 W.Va. 17, 106 S.E. 126, 128; Watts v. Southern
Ry. Co., 139 S.C. 516, 138 S.E. 290, 293; Georgia,
F. & A. Ry. Co. v. Blish Milling Co., 241 U.S. 190,
36 S.Ct. 541, 543, 60 L.Ed. 948.

## FAILURE TO MEET OBLIGATIONS

Bank's
failure to pay depositors on demand constitutes
"failure to meet obligations" in most cases. State
of Ohio ex rel. Squire v. Union Trust Co. of Pitts-
burgh, 137 Pa.Super. 75, 8 A.2d 476, 480.
Where bank closed its doors and ceased to transact busi-
ness or make transfers of capital stock, and thereafter

"failure to meet obligations". State of Ohio ex rel. Squire
v. Union Trust Co. of Pittsburgh, 137 Pa.Super. 75, 8 A.2d
476, 480.

## FAILURE TO PERFORM

As regards recipro-
cal promises, allegation of defendant's "failure to
perform" when demanded is equivalent to allega-
tion of "refusal to perform," unless performance
by plaintiff is condition precedent to cause of ac-
tion. Brooks v. Scoville, 81 Utah 163, 17 P.2d 218,
FAILURES IN REVENUE. Terms "casual de-
ficits" and "failures in revenue," within provision
authorizing Legislature to contract debt to meet
such deficits, are synonymous. State Budget

## FAIR

In English law. A greater species of
market; a privileged market. Cowell; Cunning-
ham, Law Dict. It is an incorporeal hereditament,
granted by royal patent, or established by pre-
scription presupposing a grant from the crown.
A public mart or place of buying or selling. 1
Bla.Comm. 274.
Though etymologically signifying a market for buying
and selling exhibited articles, it includes a place for the
v. Long, 46 Ohio St. 509, 28 N.E. 1038.
A fair is usually attended by a greater concourse of peo-
ple than a market, for the amusement of whom various
exhibitions are gotten up. McCulloch, Comm.Dict.; Whar-
ton, Dict.
A fair is a franchise which is obtained by a grant from
the crown. 2d Inst. 220; 3 Mod. 123; 1 Ld.Raym. 341; 2
Saund. 172; 1 Rolle, Abr. 106; Tomlin; Cunningham, Law
Dict.
In the earlier English law, the franchise to hold a fair
conferred certain important privileges; and fairs, as
legally recognized institutions, possessed distinctive legal
characteristics. Most of these privileges and character-
istics, however, are now obsolete. In America, fairs, in the
ancient technical sense, are unknown, and, in the modern
and popular sense, they are entirely voluntary and non-
legal, and transactions arising in or in connection with
them are subject to the ordinary rules governing sales, etc.
FAIR, adj. Equitable as a basis for exchange;
reasonable; a fair value. Utah Assets Corpora-
tion v. Dooley Bros. Ass'n, 92 Utah 577, 70 P.2d

## FAIR AND EQUITABLE

A proposed plan to

stock is "fair and equitable", if preferred stock-
holders' rights are transmuted into their equita-
ble equivalents. In re Securities and Exchange
Commission, C.C.A.Del., 142 F.2d 411, 419.
As condition of confirmation under provisions of Bank-
ruptcy Act relating to corporate reorganization, signify
that the final arrangement must conform to principle that
unsecured creditors are entitled to priority over stockhold-
ers to full extent of their debts and that any scaling down
of claims of creditors without fair compensating advantage
to them which is prior to rights of stockholders is inadmis-
sible. Securities and Exchange Commission v. United
States Realty & Improvement Co., 310 U.S. 434, 60 S.Ct.
1044, 1051, 84 L.Ed. 1293; In re Janson Steel & Iron Co.,
D.C.Pa., 47 F.Supp. 652, 655, 656.

713, 87 L.Ed. 892.

In a contract
to purchase a waterworks plant at fair and equita-
ble value, the amount is to be determined not by
capitalization of the earnings nor limited to the
cost of reproducing the plant, but allowance

by connection with and supply of buildings, al-
though the company did not own the connections.
National Waterworks Co. V. Kansas City, Mo.,
62 F. 863.

## FAIR AND FEASIBLE

As test in determining
whether corporate reorganization plan should be
discrimination or destruction of vested rights. In
re Stanley Drug Co., D.C.Pa., 22 F.Supp. 664, 665.
FAIR AND FULL EQUIVALENT FOR LOSS.
The same as a full and perfect equivalent. Fon-
ticello Mineral Springs Co. v. City of Richmond,
147 Va. 355, 137 S.E. 458, 460.
FAIR AND IMPARTIAL JURY means that every
member of the jury must be a fair and impartial
juror. City of San Antonio v. McKenzie Const.

ney or any one else. People v. Nationwide News Service,
16 N.Y.S.2d 277, 279, 172 Misc. 752. One wherein witnesses
of litigants are permitted to testify under rules of court

unanimous verdict of such jury. Baker v. Hudspeth, C.C.A.

reasonable opportunity to prepare for trial. Cruthirds v.
State, 190 Miss. 892, 2 So.2d 145, 146.

ment shall have no fixed opinion concerning the guilt or
innocence of one on trial. Baker v. Hudspeth, C.C.A.Kan.,
129 F.2d 779, 782, 783. There must not only be fair and
impartial jury, and learned and upright judge, but there
should be atmosphere of calm in which witnesses can
deliver their testimony without fear and intimidation, in
which attorneys can assert accused's rights freely and
fully, and in which the truth may be received and given
credence without fear of violence. Raney v. Common-
wealth, 287 Ky. 492, 153 S.W.2d 935, 937, 938.

Johns River Bridge, 108 Fla. 172, 146 So. 99, 100.

## FAIR AND REASONABLE VALUE

true in fact. People v. Hebbard, 96 Misc. 617, 162
N.Y.S. 80, 92. In a privileged communication the
words used, if defamatory and libelous, are ex-
cused, while in "fair comment" the words are not
a defamation and not libelous. Van Lonkhuyzen
v. Daily News Co., 203 Mich. 570, 170 N.W. 93, 99.

estly entertain such opinion, on facts found. Cohalan v.
New York Tribune, 172 Misc. 20, 15 N.Y.S.2d 58, 60, 61.

delightful touches of style going to make article readable,

N.E. 193, 197.

without extraneous evidence. Denny v. Stevens,
52 Wyo. 253, 73 P.2d 308, 310, 113 A.L.R. 1337.
A process fair on its face does not mean that it must
appear to be perfectly regular or in all respects in accord
with proper practice and after the most approved form, but
that it shall apparently be process lawfully issued and such
as the officer may lawfully serve, and a process is fair on
its face which proceeds from a court, magistrate, or body
having authority of law to issue process of that nature and
which is legal in form and on its face contains nothing to
notify or fairly apprise the officer that it is issued without
authority. Brown v. Hadwin, 182 Mich. 491, 148 N.W. 693,
L. R. A. 1915B, 505.

dence. A "clear" preponderance. M. E. Smith
& Co. v. Kimble, 38 S.D. 511, 162 N.W. 162, 163.
triers of fact the conviction that the party upon
whom is the burden has established its case.
Jackson Furniture Co. v. Lieberman, 65 R.1 224,
14 A.2d 27, 32. The greater and weightier evi-
dence, the more convincing evidence. Barbero
v. Pellegrino, 108 N.J.L. 156, 156 A. 765. The
greater weight of the evidence. Belmont Hotel v.
New Jersey Title Guaranty & Trust Co., 22 N.J.
Misc. 261, 37 A.2d 681, 682. Weight, credit, and
value. Chenery v. Russell, 132 Me. 130, 167 A.
857, 858.

anced, verdict should be for defendant. Funk v. Bonham,
204 Ind. 170, 183 N.E. 312, 317.

of its outweighing the evidence on the other side can be
perceived if the whole evidence is fairly considered. Bryan
v. Railroad Co., 63 Iowa, 464, 19 N.W. 295; City Bank's
Appeal, 54 Conn. 274, 7 A. 548. Such evidence as when
weighed with that which is offered to oppose it, has more
convincing power in the minds of the jury. Neely V. De-
troit Sugar Co., 138 Mich. 469, 101 N.W. 665, 666.
The probability of truth; In re Oliver's Will, 126 Misc.
511, 214 N.Y.S. 154, 166; not necessarily the largest num-
ber of witnesses; Verdi v. Donahue, 91 Conn. 448, 99 A.
1041, 1043; Chenery v. Russell, 132 Me. 130, 167 A. 857, 858.
The term conveys the idea of something more than a pre-
ponderance. Bryan v. Chicago, R. I. & P. Ry. Co., 63
Iowa, 464, 19 N.W. 295, 296; De St. Aubin v. Marshall Field
& Co., 27 Colo. 414, 62 P. 199, 201; The term is not a
technical term, but simply means that evidence which out-

judgment against a citizen be accorded credit in the courts

erty, connotes fair market value in dealing with certain
kinds of property, and in certain cases stock exchange
quotations are the best index of value, but bonds of Re-
public of Cuba, secured by apparently adequate pledges
of revenues, should be valued at par rather than market
price in absence of specific showing that Cuba might de-
fault. In re Warren Bros. Co., D.C.Mass., 39 F.Supp. 381,

change, but such a value found after considering all rele-
vant facts as will give the public utility a reasonable re-

to take testimony fairly. Language may be truly, yet un-
fairly, reported; that is, an answer may be truly written
down, yet in a manner conveying a different meaning from

reported, yet not in accordance with strict truth. Law-

restriction. It prescribed that no one could bequeath more
than three-fourths of his property in legacies, and that
the heir should have at least one-fourth of the estate, and
that, should the testator violate this prescript, the heir
may have the right to make a proportional deduction from

ican Accident Ins. Co. v. Tebbs, C.C.A.Utah, 107 F.2d 853,
Court's substitution in charge of term "fraudulent" in
place of term "false" held not misleading. Wood v. Wil-
In law, this word usually means something more than
untrue; it means something designedly untrue and deceit-
ful, and implies an intention to perpetrate some treachery
or fraud. Hatcher v. Dunn, 102 Iowa, 411, 71 N.W. 343, 36
L.R.A. 689; Masofi. v. Association, 18 U.C.C.P. 19; State v.
Leonard, 73 Or. 451, 144 P. 113, 118; State v. Smith, 63 Vt.
201, 22 A. 604. It implies either conscious wrong or
culpable negligence, and signifies knowingly or negligently

Minn., 139 F. 961, 72 C.C.A. 9, 2 L.R.A.,N.S., 185.
The word "false" has two distinct and well-recognized
meanings ; (1) intentionally or knowingly or negligently
untrue; (2) untrue by mistake or accident, or honestly aft-
et the exercise of reasonable care. Metropolitan Life Ins.
Co. v. Adams, D.C.Mun.App., 37 A.2d 345, 350. In jurispru-
dence, "false" and "falsely" are oftenest used to character-
ize a wrongful or criminal act, such as involves an error
or untruth, intentionally or knowingly put forward. A
thing is called "false" when it is done, or made, with
knowledge, actual or constructive, that it is untrue or il-
legal, or is said to be done falsely when the meaning is
that the party is in fault for its error. Fouts v. State,
113 Ohio St. 450, 149 N.E. 551, 554; Monahan v. Mutual
Life Ins. Co. of New York, 192 Wis. 102, 212 N.W. 269, 271.
The word "false" in its juristic use implies something
more than a mere untruth, Dombroski v. Metropolitan Life
Ins. Co., 126 N.J.L. 545, 19 A.2d 678, 680.
The word "false" sometimes connotes an intent to de-
ceive, People v. Wahl, 39 Cal.App.2d Supp. 771, 100 P.2d
550, 551; Salt's Textile Mfg. Co. v. Ghent, 107 Conn. 211,
139 A. 694, 695.
FALSE ACTION, See Feigned Action.

## FALSE AND FRAUDULENT

The phrase "false
and fraudulent" in Food and Drugs Act of 1906
means that the statement must have been made
with actual intent to deceive. United States v.
Dr. David Roberts Veterinary Co., C.C.A.Wis., 104
F.2d 785, 788.
To amount to actionable "false and fraudulent repre-
sentations", they must have been as to existing fact or
known by one making them, from his superior knowledge,
to have been untrue when made. Burlison v. Weis, Mo.
App., 152 S.W.2d 201, 203.

## FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENT

Fail-
ure to state material fact made letter a "false•
and misleading statement" within rule of Secur-
ities and Exchange Commission. Securities and

## FALSE CHECKS

Obtaining money by means
and use of a check upon a bank, in which the
which to meet the same, and which he had no
reason to believe would honor such check upon
presentation at said bank for payment, is obtain-
ing money by use of a false check. Gunther v.
State, 42 Okl.Cr. 129, 276 P. 237, 238.
FALSE CLAIM, in the forest law, was where a
man claimed more than his due, and was amerced
and punished for the same. Manw. c. 25; Tom-
lins.
As used in a statute making it a felony to present to
any state, county, or city board or officer a false or fraudu-
lent claim, a "false claim" is something more than a mere-
ly excessive claim. Burke v. Knox, 59 Utah, 596, 206 P. 711,
714. The act of knowingly making untruthful statements
of material facts in "reasons for refund" of excise taxes,
supported by fictitious copies of letters and cards attached
thereto, constitutes "false claim" against government,
within Criminal Code, § 35 (18 T.JSCA §§ 80, 82-86). Evans
v. U. S., C.C.A.S.C., 11 F.2d 37, 39.

## FALSE DECRETALS

trustworthy nature was demonstrated.

## FALSE DEMONSTRATION

Where description
of person or thing in will is partly true and partly

of "false demonstration." In re Heins' Estate, 132
Cal.App. 131, 22 P.2d 549.

## FALSE ENTRY

An entry in books of a bank or
trust company which is intentionally made to rep-
resent what is not true or does not exist, with
intent either to deceive its officers or a bank ex-
aminer or to defraud the bank or trust company.
Agnew v. U. S., 165 U.S. 36, 17 S.Ct. 235, 41 L.Ed.
624; Fricke v. State, 112 Neb. 767, 201 N.W. 667,

An untrue statement of items of account by written
words, figures, or marks. United States v. Herrig, D.C.
Mont., 204 F. 124, 125. One making an original false entry
makes a false entry in every book which is made up in
regular course from the entry or entries from the original
book of entry. State v. Davidson, 46 N.D. 564, 180 N.W. 31,
Where entry upon books of bank of matter contained in
deposit slip is not true it is a "false entry," Adams v.
State, 179 Ark. 1047, 20 S.W.2d 130, 133.
Entries made by cashier of balance in insurance com-
pany's account after deducting unauthorized withdrawals

C.C.A.Okl., 66 F.2d 870, 873.

## FALSE FACT

In the law of evidence. A
feigned, simulated, or fabricated fact; •a fact not
founded in truth, but existing only in assertion;
the deceitful semblance of a fact.

other falsely, and iri such assumed character to
do any act whereby any benefit might accrue to
the offender or to another person. People v.

## FALSE IMPRISONMENT

See Imprisonment.

## FALSE INSTRUMENT

A counterfeit; one
made in the similitude of a genuine instrument
and purporting on its face to be such. U. S. v.
Howell, 11 Wall. 435, 20 L.Ed. 195; U. S. v. Owens,
C.C.Tenn., 37 Fed. 115; State v. Willson, 28 Minn.
52, 9 N.W. 28.

## FALSE JUDGMENT

In old English law. A
writ which lay when a false judgment had been
pronounced in a court not of record, as a county
court, court baron, etc. Fitzh. Nat. Brev. 17, 18.
In old French law. The defeated party in a
suit had the privilege of accusing the judges of
pronouncing a false or corrupt judgment, where-
upon the issue was determined by his challenging
them to the combat or duellum. This was called
the "appeal of false judgment." Montesq. Esprit
des Lois, liv. 28, c. 27.

## FALSE LATIN

When law proceedings were
written in Latin, if a word were significant though
not good Latin, yet an indictment, declaration, or
fine should not be made void by it; but if the
word were not Latin, nor allowed by the law, and
it were in a material point, it made the whole
vicious. (5 Coke, 121; 2 Nels. 830.) Wharton.

## FALSE LIGHTS AND SIGNALS

Lights and sig-
nals falsely and maliciously displayed for the
purpose of bringing a vessel into danger. See
stat. 24 & 25 Vict. c. 97, § 47; 18 U.S.C.A. § 488.

## FALSE MAKING

An essential element of forg-
ery, where material alteration is not involved.
Term has reference to manner in which writing
is made or executed rather than to its substance
or effect. A falsely made instrument is one that
is fictitious, not genuine, or in some material par-
ticular something other than it purports to be and
without regard to truth or falsity of facts stated
therein. Wright v. U. S., C.A.Ariz., 172 F.2d 310,
FALSE NEWS. Spreading false news, whereby
discord may grow between the queen of Eng-
land and her people, or the great men of the
realm, or which may produce other mischiefs,
still seems to be a misdemeanor, under St. 3 Edw.
I. c. 34. Steph. Cr. Dig. § 95.

## FALSE OATH

To defeat discharge in bank-
ruptcy "false oath" must contain all the elements
involved in "perjury" at common law, namely, an
intentional untruth in matter material to a ma-
terial issue, In re Bergman, D.C.N.Y., 6 F.Supp.
,
898, 901, it must have been knowingly and fraud-
ulently made. In re Stone, D.C.N.H., 52 F.2d
639, 641. See, also, Perjury.

## FALSE OR FRAUDULENT CLAIM

A "false or
fraudulent claim" within meaning of statute pro-
viding for punishment of any one receiving pro-
ceeds of fraudulent audit or payment, since to be
"false or fraudulent," must be a claim for serv-
ices or materials not actually rendered or fur-
nished. People v. Dally, 175 Misc. 680, 24 N.Y.S.2d
692, 695.

## FALSE PAPER

In a statute defining an offense
of willfully and knowingly subscribing to "false
papers" to deceive bank examiners, the term re-
fers not to one which is forged or spurious, but
to a paper duly subscribed by the person purport-
ing to sign it, and containing an untrue statement
in the body of the instrument. State v. Pierson,
101 Wash. 318, 172 P. 236, 238.

## FALSE PERSONATION

acting in the character thus unlawfully assumed,
in order to deceive others, and thereby gain some
profit or advantage, or enjoy some right or priv-

ject him to some expense, charge, or liability. See
4 Steph. Comm. 181, 290.

wealth v. Becker, 151 Pa.Super. 169, 30 A.2d 195, 197.
A pretense is the holding out or offering to others some-
thing false and feigned. This may be done either by words
or actions, which amount to false representations. In fact,
false representations are inseparable from the idea of a
pretense. Without a representation which is false there
can be no pretense. State v. Joaquin, 43 Iowa, 132.
Gist of offense of "obtaining money by false pretenses"

One distinction between "embezzlement" and "false pre-
tenses" is that in the former case the defendant does not
have title to the property, while in the latter, he has.
State v. Serkau, 128 Conn. 153, 20 A.2d 725, 727.
Confidence game distinguished
A "confidence game" is any swindling opera-
tion in which advantage is taken of the confi-
dence reposed by the victim in the swindler. It
consists of gaining the possession of money or
property by means of some trick, device, or swin-
dling operation in which advantage is taken of the
confidence of the victim reposed in the swindler.
In obtaining money by "false pretenses," the false
pretenses used must have been believed and relied
on by the defrauded party and been the means
of inducing the victim to part with his property.
People v. Blume, 345 Ill. 524, 178 N.E. 48, 52.
"Confidence game" is not established by mere proof that
property has been obtained by false pretense. Clark v.
State, 53 Ariz. 416, 89 P.2d 1077, 1080.
Larceny and false pretenses distinguished
In larceny owner has no intention to part with his prop-
erty, although he may intend to part with possession,
while in false pretenses the owner does intend to part
with the property but it is obtained from him by fraud.
People v. Shwartz, 43 Cal.App. 696, 185 P. 686, 687. Roberta
v. State, 181 Ind. 520, 104 N.E. 970, 971.
In larceny owner has no intention to part with title to
and possession of property taken, while in false pretenses
he does so intend, but it is obtained from him by fraud.
Only a very narrow distinction exists between "larceny"
and "false pretense"; the character of the crime depend-
ing on the intention of the parties. Riley v. State, 64 Okl.
Cr. 183, 78 P.2d 712, 716.
The intention of owner of property not to part with ti-
tle when relinquishing possession of property is vital point
to be determined in distinguishing between "larceny by
fraud" and obtaining property by "false pretenses". Dob-
son v. State, 74 Okl.Cr. 341, 126 P.2d 95, 101.
Obtaining money or property by false pretenses
Elements are intent to defraud, actual fraud, false pre-
tense, and fraud resulting therefrom, Simmons v. State,
165 Md. 155, 167 A. 60, 64; false pretenses, that property
was obtained thereby, that false pretenses were made with
intent to cheat and defraud, and that money was paid in
reliance upon and under inducement of false pretenses,
People v. Sloane, 165 Misc. 444, 300 N.Y.S. 1032, 1035.
It is sufficient if false pretenses are a part of the mov-
ing cause, and, without them, the defrauded party would
not have parted with the property. State v. Faulkner, 139
Kan. 665, 33 P.2d 175, 177.
The distinction between "obtaining money by false pre-
tenses" and forgery is that in the former, the acquisition
of the money is the principal thing, while in forgery the
making, altering, uttering, or publishing of the written
instrument is the principal part, and money need not nec-
essarily be obtained. State v. Hobl, 108 Kan. 261, 194 P.
921, 924.
The false representations may be made by implication.
Johnson v. People, 110 Colo. 283, 133 P.2d 789, 792.
The "false pretense" may be the failure to speak when
it was necessary to do so. People v. Etzler, 292 Mich. 489,
290 N.W. 879, 880.
The ‘"false pretense" must relate to existing fact, or to
fact which has theretofore occurred. Jones v. State, 236
Ala. 30, 182 So. 404, 405.

## FALSE RECORD

The Fair Labor Standards Act
prohibiting the making of "false records" refers
to falsification of payroll records customarily
made available to a wage and hour inspector.
United States v. Selman-Reinstein, Inc., D.C.
Minn., 52 F.Supp. 208, 209, 210.

## FALSE REPRESENTATION

A representation
which is untrue, willfully made to deceive an-
other to his injury. See, also, Deceit and Fraud.
A deceitful representation, or one contrary to the fact,
made knowingly and with the design and effect of inducing
the other party to enter into the contract to which it re-
lates; a declaration of present intention, false when made,
to perform act in future, Pease & Elliman v. Wegeman,
223 App.Div. 682, 229 N.Y.S. 398, 400; a representation
known to be false by person making it, or made without
knowledge as a positive statement of known fact upon
which another relied and acted, Platte Valley Bank v.
Lemke, 141 Neb. 218, 3 N.W.2d 396, 399; a representation
of what is true, which nevertheless creates an impression
which is false. Newark Trust Co. v. Lackawanna Inv. Co.,
88 N.J.Eq. 541, 103 A. 168, 169; McClellan v. Tobin, Ind.,
219 Ind. 563, 39 N.E.2d 772, 774; an assertion of knowledge
which in fact one does not have, Tone v. Halsey, Stuart &
Co., 286 Ill.App. 169, 3 N.E.2d 142, 147; an assertion of
something as true which one does not know to be true,
Hargrove v. Henderson, 108 Cal.App. 667, 292 P. 148; such
representations as will deceive persons of ordinary pru-
dence. Union Central Life Ins. Co. v. Kerron, 128 Or. 70,
264 P. 453, 455; Holmberg v. Prudential Savings & Loan
Ass' n, 130 Or. 1, 278 P. 943, 945.
A "false representation" may arise from any conduct
capable of being turned into a statement of fact. Bundesen
v. Lewis, 291 Ill.App. 83, 9 N.E.2d 327, 334.
A "false representation" may be made scienter, so as to
afford a right of action in damages, in any of the following
ways : (1) With actual knowledge of its falsity; (2) with-
out knowledge either of its truth or falsity; or (3) under
circumstances in which the person making it ought to have
104 W.Va. 238, 139 S.E. 737, 738; Sebastian County Bank
v. Gann, 121 Ark. 145, 180 S.W. 754, 755.
A false representation, within Bankruptcy Act not af-
fected by discharge, must involve moral turpitude or inten-
tional wrong. Hisey v. Lewis-Gale Hospital, D.C.Va., 27
F.Supp. 20, 23.
False statements although future in form may be "false
representations" of existing facts and conditions. Nation-
al Theatre Supply Co. v. Rigney, Mo.App., 130 S.W.2d
258, 263.
To maintain an action for damages for "false representa-
tion," the plaintiff, in substance, must allege and must
prove by a preponderance of the evidence the following ele-
ments: (1) What representation was made; (2) that it
was false; (3) that the defendant knew it was false, or else
made it without knowledge as a positive statement of
known fact; (4) that the plaintiff believed the represen-
tation to be true; (5) that the plaintiff relied on and acted
upon the representation; (6) that the plaintiff was thereby
injured; and (7) the amount of the damages. Peterson v.
Schaberg, 116 Neb. 346, 217 N.W. 586, 587.

## FALSE RETURN

See Return.

## FALSE STATEMENT

Under statutory provi-
sion, making it unlawful for officer or director of
corporation to make any false statement in re-
gard to corporation's financial condition, the
phrase means something more than merely un-
true or erroneous, but implies that statement is
designedly untrue and deceitful, and made with
intention to deceive person to whom false' state-
ment is made or exhibited. State v. Johnston,
149 S.C. 138, 146 S.E. 657, 660.
As used in bankruptcy statute provision concerning
discharge, these words denote or connote guilty scienter on
part of bankrupt, In re Krulewitch, D.C.N.J., 60 F.2d 1039,
1041; Wilensky v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., C.C.A.
Mass., 67 F.2d 389, 390. They mean an incorrect statement
made or acquiesced in with knowledge of incorrectness or
with reckless indifference to actual facts and with no
reasonable ground to believe it correct. International Shoe
Co. v. Lewine, C.C.A.Miss., 68 F.2d 517, 518; statement
false to bankrupt's knowledge and made with fraudulent
intent, In re Johnson, D.C.Conn., 1 F.Supp. 649, 651; state-
ment knowingly false, or made recklessly without honest
belief in its truth, and with purpose to mislead or deceive,
Third Nat. Bank v. Schatten, C.C.A.Tenn., 81 F.2d 538,
540; In re Venturella, D.C.Conn., 25 F.Supp. 332. They
mean more than erroneous or untrue and import inten-
tion to deceive, Schapiro v. Tweede Footwear Corporation,
C.C.A.Pa., 131 F.2d 876, 878.
Bank's statement which gives result showing bank sub-
stantially stronger than it is in fact; constitutes "false
statement" within statute defining offense of making or
publishing false statement. Rosenberg v. State, 212 Wis.
434, 249 N.W. 541.

## FALSE SWEARING

The essential elements of
"false swearing" consist in willfully, knowingly,
absolutely and falsely swearing under oath or af-
firmation on a matter concerning which a party
could legally be sworn and on oath 'administered
by one legally authorized to administer it. Smith
v. State, 66 Ga.App. 669, 19 S.E.2d 168, 169.
To constitute "false swearing", it must appear
that matter sworn to was judicially pending or
was being investigated by grand jury, or was
a subject on which accused could legally have
been sworn, or on which he was required to be
sworn. Capps v. Commonwealth, 294 Ky. 743,
172 S.W.2d 610, 611. The oath need not be taken
in a matter judicially pending or any matter ma-
terial to any point in question. Capps v. Com-
monwealth, 294 Ky. 743, 172 S.W.2d 610, 611. See,
also, Perjury.
As used in provision concerning denial of liability under
policy, means false statement willfully made with respect
to a material matter with intention of thereby deceiving
insurer, Sands v. Bankers' Fire Ins. Co., 168 Va. 645, 192
S.E, 617; false statements made knowingly and willfully,
with intent to deceive insurer concerning matter material
to insurance, Buccola v. National Fire Ins. Co. of Hartford,
Conn., 18 La.App. 353, 137 So. 346, 350; knowingly and in-
tentionally stating upon oath what is not true, or state-
ment of a fact as true, which the party does not know to
be true, Harwood v. United States Fire Ins. Co., 136 Me.
223, 7 A.2d 899, 902; knowingly and willfully false swear-
ing to deceive or mislead insurers, Young v. California Ins.
Co., 55 Idaho 682, 46 P.2d 718, 722; misstatement in proofs
of loss willfully made, Palace Cafe v. Hartford Fire Ins.
Co., C.C.A.Ind., 97 F.2d 766, 769; statements which are not
only untrue but knowingly and intentionally made with
knowledge of their untruthfulness or those statements
which are made as the truth when party did not know them
to be true and had no reasonable grounds for believing
them to be true, and statements must be made for purpose
of defrauding insurer, United States Fire Ins. Co. v. Mer-
rick, 171 Md. 476, 190 A. 335, 342; swearing knowingly
and intentionally false and not through mere mistake.
Knight v. Boston Ins. Co., 113 N.J.L. 132, 172 A. 594, 595.
"Perjury" and "false swearing" may be interchangeable.
Ray v. Times Pub. Co., Tex.Com.App., 12 S.W.2d 165, 166.
The misdemeanor committed in English law by a person
who swears falsely before any person authorized to ad-
minister an oath upon a matter of public concern, under
such circumstances that the false swearing would have
amounted to perjury if committed in a judicial proceeding;
as where a person makes a false affidavit under the bills of
sale acts. Steph.Cr.Dig. p. 84. And see O'Bryan v. State,
27 Tex.App. 339, 11 S.W. 443. In Texas, it is not necessary,
to complete the offense, that the affidavit be used for the
purpose for which it was intended. Welch v. State, 71 Tex.
Cr.R. 17, 157 S.W. 946. Under the Texas and Kentucky
statutes, however, "false swearing" is distinct from the
common-law crime of perjury; Commonwealth v. Hinkle,
177 Ky. 22, 197 S.W. 455, 456; Shipp v. State, 81 Tex.Cr.R.
328, 196 S.W. 840, 842; inasmuch as "false swearing" con-
sists in making a false oath on a subject about which the
party could legally be sworn, and before a person legally
authorized to administer the oath; Commonwealth v.
Bradshaw, 210 Ky. 405, 276 S.W. 124, 125; it not being
necessary, as in perjury, that the testimony be material;
Sullivan v. Commonwealth, 158 Ky. 536, 165 S.W. 696, 697.

## FALSE TOKEN

In criminal law. A false docu-
ment or sign of the existence of a fact,—in gen-
eral used for the purpose of fraud. See 3 Term,
98; 2 Starkie, Ev. 563; 1 Bish. Cr. L. 585; People
v. Haynes, 14 Wend., N.Y., 570, 28 Am.Dec. 530;
Smith v. State, 74 Fla. 594, 77 So. 274, 276; State
v. Renick, 33 Or. 584, 56 P. 275, 44 L.R.A. 266.
A written release of fictitious claim was a "false token"
People v. Beilfuss, 59 Cal.App.2d 83, 138 P.2d 332, 339.

## FALSE VERDICT

See Verdict.

False weights and measures
are such as do not comply with the standard pre-
scribed by the state or government, or with the
custom prevailing in the place and business in
which they are used.

## FALSE WITNESS

One who is intentionally
rather than merely mistakenly false. State v.
Weston, 109 Or. 19, 219 P. 180, 189.
FALSE WORDS, which may be eliminated from
descriptions in wills, deeds, etc., are misdescrip-
tions of property that are not applicable to any
property owned or intended to be devised or con-
veyed. Brown v. Ray, 314 Ill. 570, 145 N.E. 676,
679; Armstrong v. Armstrong, 327 III. 85, 158
N.E. 356, 358.

## FALSEDAD

In Spanish law. Falsity; an al-
teration of the truth. Las Partidas, pt. 3, tit. 26,
1. 1.
Deception; fraud. Id. pt. 3, tit. 32, 1. 21.

## FALSEHOOD

A statement or assertion known
to be untrue, and intended to deceive. A willful
act or declaration contrary to the truth. Put-
nam v. Osgood, 51 N.H. 207.
The term is perhaps generally used in the second sense
here given. It is committed either by the wilful act of the
party, or by dissimulation, or by words.
Crabbe thus distinguishes between falsehood and un-
truth: "The latter is an untrue saying, and may be unin-
tentional, in which case it reflects no disgrace on the agent.
A falsehood and a lie are intentional false sayings, differ-
ing only in degree of the guilt of the offender; falsehood
being not always for the express purpose of deceiving, but
a lie always for the worst of purposes." See Rosc.Cr.Ev.
362; Deceit; Fraud; Misrepresentation.
A fabrication. Werner v. Southern Cal. Asso-
ciated Newspapers, Cal.App., 206 P.2d 952, 961.
Scotch Law
A fraudulent imitation or suppression of truth, to the
prejudice of another. Bell. "Something used and pub-
lished falsely." An old Scottish nomen juris. "Falsehood
is undoubtedly a nominate crime, so much so that Sir
George Mackenzie and our older lawyers used no other
term for the falsification of writs, and the name 'forgery'
has been of modern introduction." "If there is any dis-
tinction to be made between 'forgery' and 'falsehood,' I
would consider the latter to be more comprehensive than
the former." 2 Broun, 77, 78.

## FALSELY

In a false manner, erroneously, not
truly, perfidiously or treacherously. Dombroski
v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 126 N.J.L. 545, 19 A.
2d 678, 680. Knowingly affirming without prob-
able cause. Hicks v. State, 67 Ga.App. 475, 21 S.E.
2d 113, 118. See, also, False.
As applied to making or altering a writting in order to
make it forgery, implies that the paper or writing is not
genuine; that in itself it is false or counterfeit. People v.
Kramer, 352 Ill. 304, 185 N.E. 590, 591.
The use of the word falsely in a statute (against counter-
feiting) implies that there must be a fraudulent or crim-
inal intent in the act; U. S. v. King, 5 McLean 208, Fed.
Cas.No.15,535. See, also, 4 B. & C. 329; 6 Com.Dig. 58;
Stark, Cr.P1. 86.
The word "falsely", particularly in a criminal statute,
suggests something more than a mere untruth and in-
cludes perfidiously or treacherously or with intent to de-
fraud. United States v. Achtner, C.C.A.N.Y., 144 F.2d 49,
Usually used in the sense of designedly untrue and de-
ceitful, and as implying an intention to perpetrate some
treachery or fraud. Fouts v. State, 113 Ohio St. 450, 149
N.E. 551, 554; State v. Merlo, 92 Or. 678, 173 P. 317, 319;
McDonald v. McNeil, 92 Vt. 356, 104 A. 337, 339; Cro.Eliz.
201; 7 D. & R. 665. But see 1 Den.C.C. 157.

## FALSELY IMPERSONATE

To "falsely imper-
sonate" may mean to pretend to be a particular
person without lawful authority. People v. Hors
kans, 109 Colo. 177, 123 P.2d 824, 826.
FALSELY MAKE, means to make an instrument
which has no original as such and no genuine
maker whose work is copied, although in form
it may resemble a type of recognized security.
Pines v. United States, C.C.A.Iowa, 123 F.2d 825,
FALSI CRIMEN. Fraudulent subornation or con-
cealment, with design to darken or hide the truth,
and make things appear otherwise than they are.
It is committed (1) by words, as when a witness
swears falsely; (2) by writing, as when a person
antedates a contract; (3) by deed, as selling by
false weights and measures. Wharton. See Crim-
en Falsi.

## FALSIFICATION

In equity practice. The show-
ing an item in the debit of an account to be either
wholly false or in some part erroneous. 1 Story,

mutilation or addition; to tamper with; as, to falsify a
record or document. Pou v. Ellis, 66 Fla. 358, 63 So. 721,
To show, as in an accounting before a master in chan-
cery, that a charge has been inserted which is wrong; that
is, either wholly false or in some part erroneous. Pull.
Accts. 162; 1 Story, Eq.Jur. § 525. See Shores-Mueller Co.
v. Bell, 21 Ga.App. 194, 94 S.E. 83, 84; Falsification.
The word "falsify" may be used to convey two distinct
meanings-either that of being intentionally or knowingly
untrue, made with intent to defraud, or mistakenly and ac-
cidentally untrue. Washer v. Bank of America Nat. Trust
& Savings Ass'n, 21 Ca1.2d 822, 136 P.2d 297, 301.

## FALSO RETORNO BREVIUM

In old English.
law. A writ which formerly lay against the sher-

## FALSUS IN UNO, FALSUS IN OMNIBUS

False
in one thing, false in everything. Commonwealth
v. Billings, 97 Mass. 406; Mercer v. Wright, 3 Wis.
645; State v. Williams, 47 N.C. 257; Dawson v.
Bertolini, 70 R.I. 325, 38 A.2d 765, 768.
The doctrine means that, if testimony of a witness on a
material issue is willfully false and given with an inten-
tion to deceive, jury may disregard all the witness' testi-
mony. Hargrave v. Stockloss, 127 N.J.L. 262, 21 A.2d 820,
The maxim deals only with weight of evidence, Metro-
politan Life Ins. Co. v. Wright, 190 Miss. 53, 199 So. 289,
290. It does not relieve jury from passing on credibility of
the whole testimony of a false swearing witness or excuse
jury from weighing the whole testimony. State v. Willard,
346 Mo. 773, 142 S.W.2d 1046, 1052. It is a mere rule of
evidence affirming a rebuttable presumption of fact, under
which the jury must consider all the evidence of the wit-
ness, other than that which is found to be false, and it is
their duty to give effect to so much of it, if any, as is
relieved from the presumption against it and found to be
true. Levine Bros. v. Mantell, 90 W.Va. 166, 111 S.E. 501,
504; Shecil v. United States, C.C.A.Wis., 226 F. 184, 187.
It is not a rule of law and false statement, State v. Stur-
chio, 127 N.J.L. 366, 22 A.2d 235, 237. It is not a rule of
the law of evidence, but is merely an aid in weighing and
sifting of evidence. Dawson v. Bertolini, 70 R.I. 325,
38 A.2d 765, 768. It is particularly applied to the testimony
of a witness who, if he is shown to have sworn falsely in
one detail, may be considered unworthy of belief as to all
the rest of his evidence. Grimes v. State, 63 Ala. 168; Wil-
son v. Coulter, 51 N.Y.S. 804, 29 App. Div. 85; White v.
Disher, 67 Cal. 402, 7 P. 826.
The rule is merely permissive and not mandatory. Bank-
ers' Health & Life Ins. Co. v. Nichols, 44 Ga.App. 536, 162
S.E. 161.
Where a party is clearly shown to have embezzled one
article of property, it is a ground of presumption that he
may have embezzled others also. The Boston, 1 Sumn. 328,
356, Fed.Cas.No.1,673; The Santissima Trinidad, 7 Wheat.
339, 5 L. Ed. 454.

## FAMA

Lat. Fame; character, reputation; re-
port of common opinion.

## FAMA, FIDES ET OCULUS NON PATIUNTUR LUDUM

3 Bulst. 226. Fame, faith, and eyesight
do not suffer a cheat.
FAMA QU1E SUSPICIONEM INDUCIT, ORIRI
DEBET APUD BONOS ET GRAVES, NON QUID-
EM MALEVOLOS ET MALEDICOS, SED PRO-
VIDAS ET FIDE DIGNAS PERSONAS, NON
SEMEL SED SIEPIUS, QUIA CLAMOR MINUIT
ET DEFAMATIO MANIFESTAT. 2 Inst. 52. Re-
port, which induces suspicion, ought to arise from
good and grave men; not, indeed, from malevo-
lent and malicious men, but from cautious and
credible persons; not only once, but frequently;
for clamor diminishes, and defamation manifests.
FAMILIA.
Old English Law. A household; the body of
household servants; a quantity of land, otherwise
called "mansa," sufficient to maintain one family.
Du Cange; Cowell; Cunningham, Law Dict.;
Creasy, Church Hist.
Roman Law. A household; a family. On the
composition of the Roman family, see Agnati;
Cognati; and see Mackeld. Rom. Law, § 144.
Family right; the right or status of being the head of a
family, or of exercising the patria potestas over others.
This could belong only to a Roman citizen who was a "man
in his own right," (homo sui juris.) Mackeld.Rom.Law, §§
133, 144.

## FAMILLE EMPTOR

In Roman law. An inter-
mediate person who purchased the aggregate in-
heritance when sold per ces et libram, in the pro-

mitting the inheritance to the hceres proper.

## FAMILLE ERCISCUNDIE

action for the partition of the aggregate succes-
sion of a familia, where that devolved upon co-
hceredes. It was also applicable to enforce a con-

Where relatives live together because such arrangement
is more convenient or economical, or for reasons of friend-
ship or affection, such relation does not constitute them
"family". Rock Island Bank & Trust Co. v. Lamont, 361
Ill. 432, 198 N.E. 430.
Household
A "family" is a collective body of persons who form
one household under one head and one domestic govern-
ment, Sullivan v. Walburn, 9 N.J.Misc. 280, 154 A. 617, 619;
a collective body of persons forming one household under
one head and domestic government, having reciprocal,
natural and moral duties to care for one another. Hartley
v. Bohrer, 52 Idaho 72, 11 P.2d 616, 618; Krug v. Mills, 159
Md. 670, 152 A. 493, 495; a household, Sullivan v. Wal-
burn, 9 N.J.Misc. 280, 154 A. 617, 619; a household com-
posed of parents or children or other relatives, or domestics
and servants, Sullivan v. Walburn, 9 N.J.Misc. 280, 154 A.
617, 619; all members of the household living together
under the authority of the head thereof, Sullivan v. Wal-
burn, 9 N.J.Misc. 280, 154 A. 617, 619; all persons who
dwell together under a common head as a household, Hoff
v. Hoff, 132 Pa.Super. 431, 1 A.2d 506, 508; an entire House-
hold, Sullivan v. Walburn, 9 N.J.Misc. 280, 154 A. 617, 619;
the immediate members of one's household, as wife, chil-
dren, brothers, and sisters or father and mother. Niemes
v. Niemes, 97 Ohio St. 145, 119 N.E. 503, 506; those who
live in same household subject to general management and
control of the head thereof, McGee v. Crawford, 205 N.C.
318, 171 S.E. 326, 327.
Family and household are substantially synonymous,
Umbarger v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 218
Iowa 203, 254 N.W. 87; the words are often used inter-
changeably, Indemnity Ins. Co. of North America v.
Sanders, 169 Okl. 378, 36 P.2d 271, 273 ; Brovdy v. Jones &
Laughlin Steel Corporation, 145 Pa.Super. 602, 21 A.2d
437, 438; while in a restricted sense the word "family"
may be used interchangeably with "household," there is a
difference in the ideas suggested by the two words, Collins
v. Northwest Casualty Co., 180 Wash. 347, 39 P.2d 986, 989,
97 A.L.R. 1235.
Insane Persons
Under statute providing for support of family of insane
person out of his estate, "family" includes those whom in-
sane person under normal circumstances would be under
legal duty to support, such as wife and children, and under
some circumstances may include others. Woman who had
become insane person's stepmother when he was infant and
had cared for him during his infancy and to whose support
he had contributed during his minority and until he joined
Army held member of his "family" so as to be entitled to
support. In re Freeman's Estate, 171 Miss. 147, 157 So.
Insurance
Accident policy condition that insurer should have op-
portunity to be present at autopsy performed with con-
sent of insured's "family" held to apply to person who, as
surviving wife or husband, or next of kin, had right of
was nearest kin, sister held "family" within such condi-
tion. Sheehan v. Commercial Travelers' Mut. Acc. Ass'n,
283 Mass. 543, 186 N.E. 627, 631, 88 A.L.R. 975.

only those persons whom head of family is bound by
law to support. Town of St. Johnsbury v. Town of Sutton,
102 Vt. 451, 150 A. 133, 135.
Reservation lands
Words "family" and "heirs," within statute providing
for holding of reservation lands by Seneca Indians, mean
family and heirs which Indians themselves recognize.
Woodin v. Seeley, 141 Misc. 207, 252 N.Y.S. 818, 826.
Servants
A family is a body of persons who live in one household
under one head or management; a household including
parents, children and servants, and, as the case may be,
lodgers or boarders. Cleaves v. Funk, D.C.Okl., 3 F.Supp.
804, 805.
Domestic servants, when living in establishment, are in-
cluded in term "family" for purposes of serving summons.
Sullivan v. Walburn, 9 N.J.Misc. 280, 154 A. 617, 619.
Service of Process
A domestic servant may be included in term "family."

but who usually visited in defendant's home during winter
months, held not a member of defendant's "family."
Cleaves v. Funk, C.C.A.Okl., 76 F.2d 828, 829.
The word "family", as used in acts regulating service of
process, is given its restricted meaning and held to include
only a father, a mother, and their children, but the rela-
tionship between the person receiving a 'copy of the sum-
mons and the person on whom service is attempted must
be more confidential and intimate than in most employer
and employee or master and servant relationships in order
that the receipt by the former may be deemed valid serv-
ice on the latter. Moore v. Kasishke, 189 Okl. 336, 117 P.2d
113, 115, 136 A.L.R. 1502.
Support of persons
A "family" is a collection of persons living together un-
der one head, under such circumstances or conditions that
the head is under a legal or moral obligation to support
the other members, and the other members are dependent
upon him for support, Hurt v. Perryman, 173 Tenn. 646, 122
S.W.2d 426, 427; those entitled by law to look to person
for support and protection, In re Fulton's Estate, 15 Cal.
App.2d 202, 59 P.2d 508, 510; those members of the house-
hold who are dependent on the householder to whom he
owes some duty, Brokaw v. Ogle, 170 Ill. 115, 48 N.E. 394;

from him in custody of his divorced wife held person hav-
ing "family dependent on him for support". In re Mc-
Farland, D.C.Wash., 49 F.2d 342, 343.
"Family," within statute imposing liability for articles
going to support of "family," held to include wife as well
as children. Baledes v. Greenbaum, 112 Conn. 64, 151 A.
333, 334.
He upon whom law imposes duty to support growing out
of status and not out of contract, and persons to whom he
owes this duty if dwelling together in a domestic establish-
ment constitute a "family" of which he is the head.
Owens v. Altsheller & Co., 263 Ky. 727, 93 S.W.2d 844, 846.
Householder's sister and her husband living with house-
holder and dependent upon him may constitute "family".
Rock Island Bank & Trust Co. v. Lamont, 361 III. 432, 198
N.E. 430.
Moral duty to support arising from ties of blood or pos-
sibly other similar relations will be sufficient to support
claim that one is head of a family. Owens v. Altsheller &
Sister on whom moral obligation rested to support her
sister and such sister constituted "family." Standard Pav-
ing Co. v. Tolson, Tex.Civ.App., 86 S.W.2d 789, 791.
To constitute "family" within homestead or exemption
provision there must be legal or moral or natural obliga-
tion of one to support other members and corresponding de-
pendence of others. L. E. Whitham & Co. v. Briggs' Es-
tate, Tex.Com.App., 58 S.W.2d 49; Lobban v. Vander Vries
Realty & Mortgage Co., 48 Ariz. 180, 60 P.2d 933, 935;
Wineblood v. Payne, 129 Okl. 103, 263 P. 669, 671.
Town of residence of head of "family" held not liable
to reimburse another town for support furnished step-
children. Town of St. Johnsbury v. Town of Sutton, 102
Vt. 451, 150 A. 133, 135.
Wills
As respects construction of will, the word "family" de-
notes a group of persons related to each other by marriage
or blood living together under a single roof and compris-
ing a household whose head is usually the father or hus-
band, but the word is not one of inflexible meaning and
its significance to a large extent depends upon the context
and the purpose for which it is employed. The word "fam-
ily" includes those who have left father's home and have
married and established their own homes when context
and purpose indicate such significance should be attributed
to the word. Magill v. Magill, 317 Mass. 89, 56 N.E.2d 892,
894, 896, 154 A.L.R. 1406.
Testamentary precatory trust created in favor of any of
testatrix' "family" held to comprehend those who would
take under statute of distribution. Ryder v. Myers, 113 N.
J.Eq. 360, 167 A. 22, 24.
Testatrix in creating trust for benefit of granddaughter
during her life and providing that upon granddaughter's
death without issue principal should go to then living
members of granddaughter's father's "family" did not use
word family to designate those who comprised her son's
household, where testatrix knew when she executed will
that son was dead and that his widow and daughter made
their homes with testatrix and his other children lived
separate from each other. Magill v. Magill, 317 Mass. 89,
56 N.E.2d 892, 894, 896, 154 A.L.R. 1406.
The use of the word "family" disclosed a testamentary
intent to make a gift to a class including those who would
have been distributees of the deceased brothers of testatrix
had such brothers died as of the date of death of testatrix
and included therein the widows of such brothers. In re
Keegan's Estate, Sur., 37 N.Y.S.2d 368, 370, 371.
Under will of widow, providing that "I wish my hus-
band's family to share and share alike the remainder of
my property," the word "family" is equivalent to "heirs,"
In re McCrum's Estate, 97 Cal.App. 576, 275 P. 971, 972.
When the word "family" is used to designate those en-
titled to receive a legacy, the intended meaning of the
word depends upon the context of the will and upon a
showing as to whom were the objects of the testator's
bounty by reason of kinship or friendship. Where a legacy
was to a class, consisting of family of testatrix' deceased
brother who was survived by widow and three children,
each of which children maintained separate households,
"family" included widow and three children. In re Kee-
gan's Estate, Sur., 37 N.Y.S.2d 368, 370, 371.
Where testatrix created trust for benefit of granddaugh-
ter during her life and, knowing that one of granddaugh-
ter's brothers was already dead, provided that any issue
granddaughter might leave should share equally with then
living members of granddaughter's father's "family" in
division of principal of trust and thereafter upon death of
another grandson leaving a widow and two infant children
executed a codicil giving grandson's legacy under another
provision of will to his widow, word "family" was used to
designate lineal descendants of granddaughter's father
where such construction was consistent with provisions of
the will and carried out intention of testatrix. Magill v.
Magill, 317 Mass. 89, 56 N.E.2d 892, 894, 896, 154 A.L.R.

## FAMILY ARRANGEMENT

A term denoting an.
agreement between a father and his children, or
between the heirs of a deceased father, to dispose
of property, or to partition it in a different man-
ner than that which would result if the law alone
directed it, or to divide up property without ad-
ministration. In these cases, frequently, the mere
relation of the parties will give effect to bargains
otherwise without adequate consideration. 1 Chit.
Pr. 67; 1 Turn. & R. 13; Boyd v. Robinson, 93
Tenn. 1, 23 S.W. 72; De Hatre v. De Hatre, 50 Mo.
App. 1.

## FAMILY AUTOMOBILE DOCTRINE

The doc-
trine is that one who owns and maintains an au-
tomobile for the general use of his household
makes use of automobile for such purposes a part
of his business so that any member using automo-
bile for those purposes under general authority to
do so becomes his representative, for whose negli-
gence he is responsible. Durso v. A. D. Cozzolino,
Inc., 128 Conn. 24, 20 A.2d 392, 394.
It is an extension of the principle of respon-
deat superior to the relation created by operation
of family use automobile. Buss v. Wachsmith,
190 Wash. 673, 70 P.2d 417, 421. See, also, Family
Car Doctrine and Family Purpose Doctrine.
It is based on theory that members of family were en-
gaged in a joint enterprise or that child was agent of par-
ents. Paulson v. McMillan, 8 Wash.2d 295, 111 P.2d 983,
If an automobile is owned and maintained by a family
corporation for general use of a family, such as that of
corporation's manager and one of its principal stockholders,
corporation may be held liable under the "family automo-
bile doctrine" to third parties. Durso v. A. D. Cozzolino,
Inc., 128 Conn. 24, 20 A.2d 392, 394.

## FAMILY BIBLE

A Bible containing a record of
the births, marriages, and deaths of the members
of a family. As to its admissibility in evidence,
see Whart. Ev. § 219; Tayl. Ev. 572; 1 Greenl. Ev.
§ 104; L. R. 1 Ex. 255; Greenleaf v. R. Co., 30
Iowa, 301; Southern Life Ins. Co. v. Wilkinson, 53
Ga. 535; Weaver v. Leiman, 52 Md. 709.

## FAMILY CAR

Automobile used to send owner's
children to school was "family car." Coleman v.
Rollo, Tex.Civ.App., 50 S.W.2d 391, 392.

## FAMILY CAR DOCTRINE

The doctrine rests
upon the basis that the automobile is furnished
by the husband in his individual capacity and as
common-law head of the family for the use of the
family, and not as the agent of the community.
Donn v. Kunz, 52 Ariz. 219, 79 P.2d 965. It rests
on theory that operator is husband's agent and
runs automobile in husband's "business," Hart v.
Hogan, 173 Wash. 598, 24 P.2d 99; that wife is
husband's agent in carrying out one of the pur-
poses for which the automobile is purchased and
owned, Moffitt v. Krueger, 11 Wash.2d 658, 120 P.
2d 512, 513.
Under the doctrine, a father furnishing automo-
bile for pleasure and convenience of family makes
the use of automobile by family his business and
any member of family driving automobile with
father's express or implied consent is the father's
agent and the father is liable for the member's
negligence. Donn v. Kunz, 52 Ariz. 219, 79 P.2d
965, 966, 967.
See, alsp, Family Automobile Doctrine and Fam-
ily Purpose Doctrine.
The person upon whom it is sought to fasten liability
under the doctrine must own, provide, or maintain an au-
tomobile for the general use, pleasure, and convenience of
the family. Liability under the doctrine is not confined
to owner or driver. It depends upon control and use. A
widow, wife, or mother may be liable as well as a husband
or father. Hart v. Hogan, 173 Wash. 598, 24 P.2d 99. To
bring a case within doctrine, it must be shown that auto-
mobile was in fact a family pleasure automobile, but auto-
mobile purchased and used for business purposes may come
within the doctrine, where it is also used for family pleas-
ure. ; Dillon v. Burnett, 197 Wash. 371, 85 P.2d 656, 658.

## FAMILY COUNCIL

See Family Arrangement;
Family Meeting; Conseil de Famille.

ing separately from him in custody of his divorced
wife held to have "family dependent on him for
support." In re McFarland, D.C.Wash., 49 F.2d
342, 343.

Purchase price of team of horses used on farm was a
"family expense". Wall v. Crawford, 103 Colo. 66, 82 P.2d
749, 750.
Tuition for education of children of taxpayer held "fami-
ly expense". Channing v. U. S., D.C.Mass., 4 F.Supp. 33,
FAMILY GROUP, within purview of the family
ear doctrine, is not confined to persons related to
the owner, but includes members of the collective
body of persons living in his household for whose
convenience the car is maintained and who have
authority to use it. Smart v. Bissonette, 106 Conn.
447, 138 A. 365, 366; Hart v. Hogan, 173 Wash. 598,
24 P.2d 99. See Family Purpose Doctrine, infra.
The children of trust settlor including an adult son are
members of the settlor's "family group" for income tax
purposes. Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Wilson, C.
C.A.?, 125 F.2d 307, 310.

guished from an ordinary "public hotel", in con-
struction of covenant, is designed primarily for

presided over by a justice or notary, and must consist of
at least five persons, who are put under oath. In re Bot-
hick, 44 La.Ann. 1037, 11 So. 712; Civ. Code La. art. 305.
It corresponds to the "conseil de famille" of French law,
q. v. See Lemoine v. Ducote, 45 La.Ann. 857, 12 So. 939;
Commaux v. Barbin, 6 Mart.La. N.S. 455.

Co., 193 Ky. 499, 236 S.W. 1046, 1047; Thompson
v. Kansas City Rys. Co., 113 Kan. 74, 213 P. 633.
See, also, Family Automobile Doctrine; Family
Car Doctrine; Family Group.

where one maintains an automobile for pleasure or other
use of member of his family. United States Fidelity &
Guaranty Co. v. Brann, 297 Ky. 381, 180 S.W.2d 102, 104;
it is based on theory that each family member in using such
car for own pleasure is carrying out the purpose for which
it is furnished, and is the owner's agent or servant, Behse-
leck v. Andrus, 60 S.D. 204, 244 N.W. 268, 269, 88 A.L.R.
596; Hackley v. Robey, 170 Va. 55, 195 S.E. 689, 692; Ener
v. Gandy, Tex.Civ.App., 141 S.W.2d 772, 775. It is founded

45 Ga.App. 285, 164 S:E. 278, 280; Commonwealth of Ken-
tucky, for Use and Benefit of Kern, v. Maryland Casualty
Co. of Baltimore, Md., C.C.A.Ky., 112 F.2d 352, 356.

ily, but the one who owns or provides the automobile is
liable. McNamara v. Prather, 277 Ky. 754, 127 S.W.2d 160,
161,162. A wife may be held liable for the torts of her

App. 31, 12 S.E.2d 92, 94. Agency is the very genesis of the
doctrine, Vaughn v. Booker, 217 N.C. 479, 8 S.E.2d 603, 604,
605; Grandmother standing in loco parentis to grandson

has been accepted by the courts of about half of the
states. Jacobsen v. Dailey, 36 N.W.2d 711, 228 Minn. 201.
Among those states are Georgia, Nebraska, North Caro-
lina, and Oregon.
On the other han•d, the doctrine has been specifical-
ly rejected, or not adopted, by fully one-half of the
states, including California, Illinois, Mississippi, New
York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Wisconsin. In Min-
nesota it has been held that the doctrine has been su-
perseded by a financial responsibility statute (M.S.A- . §
170.54). Ellingboe v. Guerin, 36 N.W.2d 598, 228 Minn.
211. For a full discussion of the subject, see Blashfield,
Cyc. of Automobile Law and Prac., Perm.Ed., § 3111 et seq.

## FAMILY RELATION

A relationship which may
exist between one taken into the family by the
head of the family, notwithstanding the absence
of blood relationship or of legal adoption. Nelson
v. Poorman's Estate, Mo.App., 215 S.W. 753, 754.
Such relation exists : between two sisters when there
Is moral obligation on part of one to support and care for
the other and when necessity for such care and support
exists, Standard Paving Co. v. Tolson, Tex.Civ.App., 86 S.
W.2d 789, 791; when child, receives from parent services,
maintenance, or gifts reasonably frequent to lead to ex-
pectation of future enjoyment thereof. Gaydos v. Dom-
abyl, 301 Pa. 523, 152 A. 549, 551; Where brother owes
moral obligation to support sister and necessity for such
support exists, Central Life Assur. Soc. (Mutual) v. Gray,

members, and there is dependence upon such members for
support, Standard Paving Co. v. Tolson, Tex.Civ.App., 86
S.W.2d 789, 791.

## FAMILY SERVICE RULE

Under "family-pur-
pose doctrine" or "family-service rule" or "family-
automobile doctrine" or "family-car rule", family
head maintaining automobile for use of family is
liable for injury resulting from negligence of
minor son who is member of family while operat-
ing automobile with knowledge and consent of
family head for comfort or pleasure of family.

406, 407.

which proceeds from inexcusable negligence or ignorance;
it is considered as nearly equal to fraud. The slight fault

able, and for which no responsibility is incurred. Civil

"Faux may be understood in three ways. In its most
extended sense it is the alteration of truth, with or without
intention; it is nearly synonymous with 'lying.' In a less
extended sense, it is the alteration of truth, accompanied
with fraud, mutatio veritatis cum dolo facta. And lastly,
in a narrow*, or rather the legal, sense of the word, when
it is a question to know if the faux be a crime, it is the
fraudulent alteration of the truth in those cases ascer-
tained and punished by the law." Touillier, t. 9, n. 188.
Old English Law. False; counterfeit. Faux ac-
tion, a false action. Litt. § 688. Faux money,

Hunt v. Rousmanier's Adm'r, 8 Wheat. U.S. 195,

## FAVORABILIORES SUNT EXECUTIONES ALIIS PROCESSIBUS QUIBUSCUNQUE

Co.
Litt. 289. Executions are preferred to all other
processes whatever.

## FAVORED BENEFICIARY

Within rule that con-
fidential relations and activity by favored bene-

## FEALTY

In feudal law. Fidelity; allegiance
to the feudal lord of the manor; the feudal ob-
ligation resting upon the tenant or vassal by
which he was bound to be faithful and true to his
lord, and render him obedience and service. See
De Peyster v. Michael, 6 N.Y. 497, 57 Am.Dec.
470; Littleton §§ 117, 131; Wright, Ten. 35;
Termes de la Ley; 1 Washb. R. P. 19; 1 Poll. &
Maitl. 277-287; Stubbs, Const. Hist. § 462 n; Co.
Lit. 67b; 3 Kent 510.
This fealty was of two sorts: that which is general, and
is due from every subject to his prince; the other special,
and required of such only as in respect of their fee are
tied by this oath to their landlords; 1 Bla.Comm. 367;
Cowell.
Fealty signifies fidelity, the phrase "feal and leal" mean-
ing simply "faithful and loyal." Tenants by knights'
service and also tenants in socage were required to take an
oath of fealty to the king or others, their immediate lords;
and fealty was one of the conditions of their tenure, the
breach of which operated a forfeiture of their estates.
Brown.
Although foreign jurists considered fealty and homage as
convertible terms, because in some continental countries
they are blended so as to form one engagement, yet they
are not to be confounded in our country, for they do not
imply the same thing, homage being the acknowledgment
of tenure, and fealty, the vassal oath of fidelity, being the
essential feudal bond, and the animating principle of a
feud, without which it could not subsist. Wharton.
ness of approaching danger.
Apprehension of harm or punishment, as ex-
hibited by outward and visible marks of emotion.
An evidence of guilt in certain cases. See Burrill,
Circ. Ev. 476.
The "fear" which renders evidence of female's utmost
resistance unnecessary to support conviction of "rape" is a
fear of death or great bodily harm, or a fear that so over-
powers female that she dares not resist, or a fear and ter-
ror so extreme as to preclude resistance, or a fear which
renders female's mind well nigh incapable of continuing
her resistance. State v. Hoffman, 228 Wis. 235, 280 N.W.
357, 359, 361.
Statutes defining crime of extortion and providing pun-
ishment therefor must be read together, and "fear," within
statute defining term as obtaining of property from another
with his consent induced by "fear," must be induced by
threats, and hence threat is necessary ingredient of crime.
State v. Anderson, 66 N.D. 522, 267 N.W. 121, 124.

complished. Gilmartin v. D. & N. Transp. Co., 123 Conn.

167 S.W.2d 986, 990; practically possible or capable of be-
ing managed, utilized, or dealt with successfully, In re
Washakie Needles Irr. Dist., 52 Wyo. 518, 76 P.2d 617, 621.
A "feasible method of liquidation", as used in section of
Bankruptcy Act setting out conditions precedent to con-
firmation of agricultural extension proposal, means that
court must be convinced before confirming proposal that
proposal to creditors is one that probably can be carried
out by debtor and result in liquidation to secured creditors
and rehabilitation for farmer, and that it is to best inter-
ests of all creditors. Heldstab v. Equitable Life Assur.
Soc. of United States, C.C.A.Kan., 91 F.2d 655, 659.

of corporate reorganization must be feasible, does not con-

courts, in England, before 1875, were fixed to be-
gin on certain days determined with reference to
the occurrence of four of the chief feasts.

istration.

## FECIALES

Among the ancient Romans, that
order of priests who discharged the duties of am-
bassadors. Subsequently their duties appear to
have related more particularly to the declaring war
and peace. Calvin.; 1 Kent, Comm. 6.
FEDERAL.
American Law. Belonging to the general govern-
ment or union of the states. Founded on or or-
ganized under the constitution or laws of the Unit-
ed States.
The United States has been generally styled, in American
political and judicial writings, a "federal government."
The term has not been imposed by any specific constitu-
tional authority, but only expresses the general sense and
opinion upon the nature of the form of government. In
recent years, there is observable a disposition to employ
the term "national" in speaking of the government of the
Union. Neither word settles anything as to the nature or
powers of the government. "Federal" is somewhat more
appropriate if the government is considered a union of
the states; "national" is preferable if the view is adopted
that the state governments and the Union are two distinct
systems, each established by the people directly, one for
local and the other for national purposes. See United
States v. Cruikshank, 92 U.S. 542, 23 L.Ed. 588; Abbott;
Mills, Representative Government 301; Freeman, Fed.
Gov't.
Constitutional Law. A term commonly used to
express a league or compact between two or more
states, to become united under one central govern-
ment. Montana Auto Finance Corporation v. Brit-
ish & Federal Underwriters of Norwich Union

sion or portion of any state, provided it is taken

Census Bureau of the United States, and approved
and certified by it as the census of that state or
subdivision. In re Cleveland's Claim, 72 Okl. 279,
180 P. 852, 885.
FEDERAL COMMON LAW is a body of decision-
al law developed by the federal courts untram-
meled by state court decisions. O'Brien v. Wes-
tern Union Telegraph Co., C.C.A.Mass., 113 F.2d
539, 541.

## FEDERAL COURTS

States. See Courts of the United States.

## FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

The system of gov-
ernment administered in a state formed by the
union or confederation of several independent or
quasi, independent states; also the composite state
so formed.
In strict usage, there is a distinction between a confeder-
ation and a federal government. The former term denotes
a league or permanent alliance between several states, each
of which is fully sovereign and independent, and each of
which retains its full dignity, organization, and sovereign-
ty, though yielding to the central authority a controlling
power for a few limited purposes, such as external and
diplomatic relations. In this case, the component states
are the units, with respect to the confederation, and the
citizens. In a federal government, on the other hand, the
allied states form a union,—not, indeed, to such an extent
as to destroy their separate organization or deprive them
of quasi sovereignty with respect to the administration of
their purely local concerns, but so that the central power is
erected into a true state or nation, possessing sovereignty
both external and internal,—while the administration of na-
tional affairs is directed, and its effects felt, not by the sep-
arate states deliberating as units, but by the people of all,
in their collective capacity, as citizens of the nation. The
distinction is expressed, by the German writers, by the use
of the two words "Staatenbund" and "Bundesstaat;" the
former denoting a league or confederation of states, and
the latter a federal government, or state formed by means
of a league or confederation.

Estates
Ordinarily, word "fee" or "fee simple" is ap-
plied to an estate in land, but term is applicable
to any kind of hereditament, corporeal or incor-
poreal, and is all the property in thing referred
to or largest estate therein which person may
have. In re Forsstrom, 44 Ariz. 472, 38 P.2d 878,
A freehold estate in lands, held of a superior lord, as a
reward for services, and on condition of rendering some
service in return for it. The true meaning of the word
"fee" is the same as that of "feud" or "fief," and in its
original sense it is taken in contradistinction to "allodi-
urn," which latter is defined as a man's own land, which
he possesses merely in his own right, without owing any
rent or service to any superior. 2 Bl.Comm. 105. See Wen-
dell v. Crandall, 1 N.Y. 491.
In modern English tenures, "fee" signifies an estate of in-
heritance, being the highest and most extensive interest
which a man can have in a feud; and when the term is
used simply, without any adjunct, or in the form "fee-
simple," it imports an absolute inheritance clear of any
condition, limitation, or restriction to particular heirs, but
descendible to the heirs general, male or female, lineal or
collateral. 2 Bl.Comm. 106; Cowell; Termes de la Ley;
1 Washb.R.P. 51; Co.Litt. 1 b; 1 Prest. Est. 420; 3 Kent
Base fee. A determinable or qualified fee; an estate hav-
ing the nature of a fee, but not a fee simple absolute. In
re Douglass' Estate, 94 Neb. 280, ,143 N. W. 299, 302.
Conditional fee. An estate restrained to some particular
heirs, exclusive of others, Blume v. Pearcy, 204 S.C. 409, 29
S.E.2d 673, 674, as to the heirs of a man's body, by which
only his lineal descendants were admitted, in exclusion of
collateral; or to the heirs male of his body, in exclusion of
heirs female, whether lineal or collateral. It was called a
"conditional fee," by reason of the condition expressed or
implied in the donation of it that, if the donee died without
such particular heirs, the land should revert to the donor.
2 Bl.Comm. 110. The term includes a fee that is either
to commence or determine on some condition, 10 Co. 950;
Prest.Est. 476; Fearne, Cont.Rem. 9; and is sometimes
used interchangeably with "base fee," that is, one to de-
termine or be defeated on the happening of some con-
tingent event or act. Citizens' Electric Co. v. Susque-
hanna Boom Co., 270 Pa. 517, 113 A. 559, 561; Glass v.
Johnson, 297 111. 149, 130 N.E. 473, 474.
Determinable fee. Also called a "base" or "qualified"
fee. Stubbs v. Abel, 114 Or. 610, 233 P. 852, 859. One
which has a qualification subjoined to it, and which must
be determined whenever the qualification annexed to it is
at an end. Littleton § 254; Co.Litt. 27a, 220; 1 Prest.Est.
449; 2 Bla.Comm. 109; Cruise, Dig. tit. 1, § 82. An estate
in fee which is liable to be determined by some act or
event expressed on its limitation to circumscribe its con-
tinuaAce, or inferred by law as bounding its extent. 1
Washb. Real Prop. 62; McLane v. Bovee, 35 Wis. 36. An
estate which may last forever is a "fee," but if it may end
on the happening of a merely possible event, it is a
"determinable," or "qualified fee." Reichard v. Chicago,
B. & Q. R. Co., 231 Iowa 563, 1 N.W.2d 721, 727.
Determinable fee or fee simple. Estate created with spe-

gal title in fee simple to active trust estate is by will
placed in trustees who are required to distribute property

Limited fee. An estate of inheritance in lands, which is
clogged or confined with some sort of condition or qualifi-
cation. Such estates are base or qualified fees, conditional
fees, and fees-tail. The term is opposed to "fee-simple."
2 Bl.Comm. 109; Lott v. Wyckoff, 1 Barb., N.Y., 575; Pat-
erson v. Ellis, 11 Wend., N.Y., 259.
Plowman's fee. In old English law, was a species of ten-
ure peculiar to peasants or small farmers, somewhat like
gavelkind, by which the lands descended in equal shares to
all the sons of the tenant.
Qualified fee. In English law. A fee having a qualifica-
tion subjoined thereto, and which must be determined
whenever the qualification annexed to it is at an end; oth-
erwise termed a "base fee." 2 Bl.Comm. 109; 1 Steph.
Comm. 225. An interest which may continue forever, but
is liable to be determined, without the aid of a conveyance,
by some act or event, circumscribing its continuance or
extent. 4 Kent, Comm. 9; Moody v. Walker, 3 Ark. 190;
U. S. v. Reese, 27 Fed.Cas. 744. An interest given to a man
and certain of his heirs at the time of its limitation. • See
Kelso v. Stigar, 75 Md. 397, 24 A. 18.
Quasi fee. An estate gained by wrong. Wharton.
Also, the land which is held in fee.
American Law
An estate of inheritance without condition, be-
longing to the owner, and alienable by him or
transmissible to his heirs absolutely and simply,
and is an absolute estate in perpetuity and the
largest possible estate a man can have, being, in
fact, allodial in its nature. Stanton v. Sullivan,
63 R.I. 216, 7 A.2d 696, 698, 699.
Every estate which is not for life, for years or at will.
Chance v. Weston, 96 Or. 390, 190 P. 155, 157.
Terms "fee," "fee simple," and "fee simple absolute,"
are equivalent. Boon v. Boon, 348 Ill. 120, 180 N.E. 792,
FEE AND LIFE-RENT. In Scotch law, two es-
tates in land—the first of which is the full right
of proprietorship, the second the limited right
of usufruct during life—may be held together, or
may co-exist in different persons at the same
time. See Bell, Prin. § 1712; Ersk. Prin. 420;
Fiar.

## FEE-FARM

A species of tenure, where land is
held of another in perpetuity at a yearly rent,
without fealty, homage, or other services than
such as are specially comprised in the feoffment.
It corresponds very nearly to the "emphyteusis"
of the Roman law. Cowell. Fealty, however,
was incident to a holding in fee-farm, according
to some authors. Spelman; Termes de la Ley.
Fee-farm is where an estate in fee is granted subject to a
rent in fee of at least one-fourth of the value of the lands
at the time of its reservation. Such rent appears to be
considerable a rent is indeed only letting lands to farm in
fee-simple, instead of the usual method of life or years. 2
Bl. Comm. 43; 1 Steph.Comm. 676.
Fee-farms are lands held in fee to render for them an-
nually the true value, or more or less; so called because
a farm rent is reserved upon a grant in fee. Such estates
are estates of inheritance. They are classed among estates
in fee-simple. No reversionary interest remains in the
lessor, and they are therefore subject to the operation of
the legal principles which forbid restraints upon alienation
in all cases where no feudal relation exists between grantor
and grantee. De Peyster v. Michael, 6 N.Y. 497, 57 Am.Dec.

## FEE-FARM RENT

The rent reserved on grant-
ing a fee-farm. It might be one-fourth the value
of the land, according to Cowell; one-third, ac-
cording to other authors. Spelman; Termes de la
Ley; 2 Bl. Comm. 43. Fee-farm rent is a rent-
charge issuing out of an estate in fee; a perpetual
rent reserved on a conveyance in fee-simple. De
Peyster v. Michael, 6 N.Y. 467, 495, 57 Am.Dec.
FEE SIMPLE.
Absolute
A fee simple absolute is an estate limited ab-
solutely to a man and his heirs and assigns for-
ever without limitation or condition. Rathbun v.
State, 284 Mich. 521, 280 N.W. 35, 40.
Conditional
At the common law, an estate in fee simple con-
ditional was a fee limited or restrained to some
particular heirs, exclusive of others. But the stat-
ute "De Donis" converted all such estates into
estates tail. 2 Bl. Comm. 110.
American Law
An absolute or fee-simple estate is one in which
the owner is entitled to the entire property, with
unconditional power of disposition during his life,
and descending to his heirs and legal representa-
tives upon his death intestate. Code Ga. 1882, §
2246 (Civ.Code 1910, § 3657). Friedman v. Steiner,
107 Ill. 131; Woodberry v. Matherson, 19 Fla.
785; Lyle v. Richards, 9 Serg. & R., Pa. 374. Un-
limited as to duration, disposition, and descend-
ibility. Slayden v. Hardin, 257 Ky. 685, 79 S.W.
2d 11, 12.
The estate which a man has where lands are
given to him and to his heirs absolutely without
any end or limit put to his estate. 2 Bl. Comm.
106; Plowd. 557; 1 Prest. Est. 425; Litt. § 1. The
word "fee," used alone, is a sufficient designation
of this species of estate, and hence "simple" is
not a necessary part of the title, but it is added
as a means of clearly distinguishing this estate
from a fee-tail or from any variety of conditional
estates.
Fee-simple signifies a pure fee; an absolute estate of
inheritance clear of any condition or restriction to particu-
lar heirs, being descendible to the heirs general, whether
male or female, lineal or collateral. It is the largest estate
and most extensive interest that can be enjoyed in land.
Haynes v. Bourn, 42 Vt. 686; Powers v. Trustees of Cale-
donia County Grammar School, 93 Vt. 220, 106 A. 836, 841;
Smith v. Smith's Ex'r, 122 Va. 341, 94 S.E. 777, 779. When
a person owns in common with another, he does not own
the entire fee,—a fee-simple; it is a fee divided or shared
with another. Brackett v. Ridlon, 54 Me. 426.
Terms "fee," "fee simple," and "fee simple absolute,"
are equivalent. Boon v. Boon, 348 Ill. 120, 180 N.E. 792,
English Law
A freehold estate of inheritance, absolute and
unqualified. It stands at the head of estates as
the highest in dignity and the most ample in ex-
tent; since every other kind of estate is derivable
thereout, and mergeable therein. It may be en-
joyed not only in land, but also in advowsons,
commons, estovers, and other hereditaments, as
well as in personalty, as an annuity or dignity,
and also in an upper chamber, though the lower
buildings and soil belong to another. Wharton;
Co.Litt. 1 b; 2 Bla. Comm. 106.

## FEE TAIL

A freehold estate in which there is
a fixed line of inheritable succession limited to the
issue of the body of the grantee or devisee, and
in which the regular and general succession of
heirs at law is cut off. Coleman v. Shoemaker,
147 Kan. 689, 78 P.2d 905, 907.
An estate tail; an estate of inheritance given to a man
and the heirs of his body, or limited to certain classes of
particular heirs. It corresponds to the feudum talliatum
of the feudal law, and the idea is believed to have been
borrowed from the Roman law, where, by way of fldei
commissa, lands might be entailed upon children and freed-
men and their descendants, with restrictions as to aliena-
tion. 1 Washb.Real Prop. *66. For the varieties azad
special characteristics of this kind of estate, see Tail,
Estate in.

## FEED

To lend additional support; to strengthen
ex post facto. "The interest when it accrues feeds
the estoppel." Christmas v. Oliver, 5 Mood. &
R. 202. Similarly, a subsequent title acquired
by the mortgagor is said "to feed the mortgage."
The word is used in its ordinary sense with reference to
cattle and hogs which are said to be made marketable by
feeding. Brockway v. Rowley, 66 Ill. 102.
It is also used in the phrase feeding of a cow by and on
the land to signify from the land while there is food on it,
and with hay by the owner of the land at other times; 2
Q. B. Div. 49.

## FEGANGI

In old English law, a thief caught
while escaping with the stolen goods in his pos-
session. Spelman.

## FEHMGERICHTE

The name given to certain
secret tribunals which flourished in Germany
from the end of the twelfth century to the middle
of the sixteenth, usurping many of the functions
of the governments which were too weak to main-
tain law and order, and inspiring dread in all
who came within their jurisdiction. Enc. Brit.
Such a court existed in Westphalia (though with
greatly diminished powers) until finally sup-
pressed by Jerome Bonaparte in 1811. See Bork,
Geschichte der Westphaelischen Vehmgerichte;
Paul Wigand, Das Fehmgericht Westphaleus.

## FEIGNED

Fictitious; pretended; suppositi-
tious; simulated.

## FEIGNED ACCOMPLICE

One who pretends to
consult and act with others in the planning_Dr
commission of a crime, but only for the purpose
of di$covering their plans and confederates and
securing evidence against them. State v. Ver--
ganadis, 50 Nev. 1, 248 P. 900, 903; People v. Bol-
anger, 71 Cal. 17, 11 P. 800.

## FEIGNED ACTION

In- practice, an action
brought on a pretended right, when the plaintiff
has no true cause of action, for some illegal pur-
pose. In a feigned action the words of the writ
are true. It differs from false action, in which
case the words of the writ are false. Co. Litt.

## FEIGNED DISEASES

Simulated maladies. Dis-
eases are generally feigned from one of three
causes,—fear, shame, or the hope of gain.

## FEIGNED ISSUE

An issue framed to try ques-
tions of fact. Miles v. Layton, 8 W.W.Harr. 411,
193 A. 567, 574, 112 A.L.R. 786.
An issue made up by the direction of a court of equity,
(or by consent of parties,) and sent to a common-law court,
for the purpose of obtaining the verdict of a jury on some
disputed matter of fact which the court has not jurisdic-
tion, or is unwilling, to decide. It rests upon a suppositi-
tious wager between the parties. See 3 Bl.Comm. 452.
Under the reformed codes of some states issues may be
framed in certain exceptional cases. In England, the prac-
tice has been disused since the passing of the stat. 8 and 9
Vict. c. 109, s. 19, permitting any court to refer any ques-
tion of fact to a jury in a direct form. The act 21 and 22
Vict. c. 27, provided for trial by jury in the court of chan-
cery.

## FELAGUS

In Saxon law, one bound for an-
other by oath; a sworn brother. A friend bound
in the decennary for the good behavior of an-
other. One who took the place of the deceased.
Thus, if a person was murdered, the recompense
due from the murderer went to the felagus of
the slain, in default of parents or lord. Cun-
ningham; Cowell; Du Cange.

## FELD

A field; in composition, wild. Blount.

## FELE, FEAL

L. Fr. Faithful. See Feal.
FELLATIO, or FELLATION. The offense com-
mitted with the male sexual organ and the mouth.

of; a companion; one with whom we consort;
one joined with another in some legal status or
relation; a member of a college or corporate
body.

## FELLOW-HEIR

inheritance.

## FELLOW SERVANT

One who serves and is
controlled by the same master. Walsh v. Eu-
banks, 183 Ark. 34, 34 S.W.2d 762, 764.
Those engaged in the same common pursuit, under the
same general control. Cooley, Torts 541. Those who derive
authority and compensation from the same common source,
and are engaged in the same general business, though it
may be in different grades or departments of it. 2 Thomp.
Neg. p. 1026, § 31; Southern Ry. Co. v. Taylor, 57 App.D.C.
21, 16 F.2d 517, 519; Brush Electric Light Co. v. Wells, 110
Ga. 192, 35 S.E. 365. When servants are employed and paid
by the same master, and their duties are such as to bring
them into such relation that negligence of one in doing his
work may injure other in performance of his, then they are
engaged in the same common business, and are "fellow
servants." Hercules Powder Co. v. Hammack, 145 Miss.
304, 110 So. 676, 677. But it has been held that an inferior
employee is not a "fellow servant" of a superior employee.
McDonald v. Louisville & N. R. Co., 232 Ky. 734, 24 S.W.2d
585, 587.
Convicts in involuntary servitude, having no power to
refuse to enter upon the service to which they have been
hired out by the state, or to quit it, are not "fellow serv-
ants." Sloss-Sheffield Steel & Iron Co. v. Weir, 179 Ala.
227, 60 So. 851, 853.

## FELLOW-SERVANT RULE

The rule that the
master is not liable for injuries to a servant,
caused by the negligence of a fellow servant en-
gaged in the same general business, where the
master has exercised due care in selection of serv-
ants. Setzkorn v. City of Buffalo, 219 App.Div.
416, 219 N.Y.S. 351, 352.

194 So. 421, 422. One who commits some unlawful or mali-
cious act which results in his own death. Hale, P.C. 411;
4 Bl.Comm. 189; Life Ass'n v. Waller, 57 Ga. 536.

## FELON

But a person who has committed a felony, been con-
victed, served his sentence, and been discharged, may be
deemed, at least for some purposes, to be no longer a
felon; 3 Exch. Div. 352.

## FELONIA

sis or circumlocution. 4 Coke, 39; Co.Litt. 391a; 4
Bl.Comm. 307.

## FELONIOUS

A technical word of law which
means done with intent to commit crime; of the
grade or quality of a felony; such an assault on
the person as, if consummated, would subject

ment of a felony, that is, to imprisonment in the
penitentiary. Hinkle v. State, 94 Ga. 595, 21 S.E.

## FELONIOUS HOMICIDE

Killing of human be-
ing without justification or excuse. State v. Plum-

(G 6) ; Bac.Abr. Indictment (G 1) ; 2 Hale, Pl.Cr. 172, 184;
1 Ben. & H. Lead. Cr.Cas. 154. It is still necessary in
describing a common-law felony, or where its use is pre-
scribed by statute; Whart.Cr.P1. § 260; Bowler v. State,
41 Miss. 570; Cain v. State, 18 Tex. 387.

## FELONY

A crime of a graver or more atro-
cious nature than those designated as misdemean-
ors. Ex parte Ramirez, 49 Cal.App.2d 709, 122 P.
2d 361, 362. Generally an offense punishable by
death or imprisonment in penitentiary. People
v. Pointer, 348 Ill. 277, 180 N.E. 796, 797, or state
prison. State v. Harwood, 206 N.C. 87, 173 S.E.
24, 25. And at common law, an offense occasion-
ing total forfeiture of either land or goods to
which capital or other punishment might be su-
peradded according to degree of guilt. Bell v.
Commonwealth, 167 Va. 526, 189 S.E. 441, 443.
Felony, compounding of. See Compounding
Felony.
Misprision of felony. See Misprision.
Reducible felony. A felony upon conviction of
which the offender may be punished as for a
misdemeanor, upon recommendation of the jury.
Atkins v. State, 154 Ga. 540, 114 S.E. 878.
American Law
The term has no very, definite or precise meaning, except
in some cases where it is defined by statute. In general,
what is felony under the English common law is such under
ours, 1 Bish.Cr.L. § 617; Clark, Cr.L. 33. A crime is not
a felony unless so declared by statute, or it was such at the
common law; State v. Murphy, 17 R.I. 698, 24 A.. 473, 16
L.R.A. 550.
Whether an offense is a "felony" depends on whether the
offense may be punished by confinement in the penitentiary
and not on whether such punishment of necessity follows
conviction of that offense. Lashley v. State, 236 Ala. 1. 1.80
So. 717, 718, 719. Sentence actually given determines
nature of offense. People v. Brown, 52 Cal.App.2d 428, 126
P.2d 406, 408.
Under U. S. Cr. Code, § 335, 18 U.S.C.A. § 1, offenses
punishable by death or imprisonment for a term exceeding
one year are felonies. Joplin Mercantile Co. v. United
States, C.C.A.Mo., 213 F. 926, 935, Ann.Cas.1916C, 470.
English Law
This term meant originally the state of having forfeited
lands and goods to the crown upon conviction for certain
offenses, and then, by transition, any offense upon convic-
tion for which such forfeiture followed, in addition to
capital or any other punishment prescribed by law; as
distinguished from a "misdemeanor," upon conviction for
which no forfeiture followed. All indictable offenses are
either felonies or misdemeanors, but a material part of the
distinction is taken away by St. 33 & 34 Vict. c. 23, which
abolishes forfeiture for felony. Wharton; 4 B1&Comm. 94;
1 Russ.Cr. 78; Co.Litt. 391; 1 Hawk Pl.Cr. c. 37; U. S. v.
Smith, 5 Wheat., U. S., 153, 5 L.Ed. 57; 1 Bish. New Cr.L.
§ 616.
At early common law the term was applied to describe
the more serious offenses cognizable in the royal courts,
conviction for which entailed forfeiture of life, limb and
chattels and escheat of lands to the felon's lord after a year
and a day in the king's hands. Subsequently, however, the
classification was so greatly enlarged that many offenses
not involving moral turpitude were included therein. In re
Donegan, 282 N.Y. 285, 26 N.E.2d 260, 261.
Feudal Law
An act or offense on the part of the vassal, which cost
him his fee, or in consequence of which his fee fell into the
hands of his lord; that is, became forfeited.' (See Felo-
nia.) Perfidy, ingratitude, or disloyalty to a lord.

## FELONY ACT

istrators of the property of felons. Mozley &
Whiteley; 4 Steph. Comm. 10, 459.

## FELONY-MURDER RULE

Any homicide com-
mitted while perpetrating or attempting felony is
first-degree murder. Payne v. State, 406 P.2d 922,
924, 81 Nev. 503; Element of legal malice is sup-
plied from the commission of the felony. Corn. v.
Cater, 152 A.2d 259, 261, 396 Pa. 172.

## FELTING

In the process of "felting," as ap-
plied to the manufacture of fur felt hats, the fur

who have been married, but whose marriage has
been dissolved by death or divorce, and, for most

Del. 213, 30 A. 994.

## FEME SOLE TRADER

In English law, a mar-
ried woman, who, by the custom of London, trades
on her own account, independently of her hus-

The custom was recognized as common law in South
Carolina, but did not extend beyond trading in merchan-
dise; McDaniel v. Cornwell, 1 Hill, S.C., 429; Newbiggin
v. Pillans, 2 Bay, S.C., 164. By statute in several states a
similar custom is recognized, as in Pennsylvania, by act of
Feb. 22, 1718, 48 P.S. § 41. Black v. Tricker, 59 Pa. 13;

LEGITIMA VEL H1EREDITAS PURA. Litt. § 1.
A fee-simple, so called because fee is the same as
inheritance, and simple is the same as lawful or

## FEODUM TALLIATUM, I. e., HIEREDITAS IN QUANDAM CERTITUDINEM LIMITATA

Litt.
§ 13. Fee-tail, e., an inheritance limited in a

bestower was called "feoffator," and the grantee
or feoffee, "feoffatus." 1 Reeve, Hist. Eng. Law,
feoffor; one who gives or bestows a fee; one
who makes a feoffment. Bract. fols. 12b, 81.

In old English law, a feoffee; one
to whom a fee is given, or a feoffment made.
Bract. fols. 17b, 44b.

## FEOFFEE

He to whom a fee is conveyed. Litt.

the same position with reference to a use that a
trustee does to a trust. 1 Greenl. Cruise, Dig. 333.
He answers to the hares fiduciarius of the Roman
law.

## FEOFFMENT

The gift of any corporeal here-
ditament to another (2 Bl. Comm. 310), operat-
ing by transmutation of possession, and requiring,
as essential to its completion, that the seisin be
passed (Watk. Cony. 183), which might be ac-
complished either by investiture or by livery of
seisin. 1 Washb. Real Prop. 33. Thatcher v.
Omans, 3 Pick., Mass., 532; French v. French, 3
N.H. 260. A gift of a freehold interest in land
accompanied by livery of seisin. The essential
part is the livery of seisin, 3 Holdsw. Hist. E. L.
Also the deed or conveyance by which such cor-
poreal hereditament is passed.
A feoffment originally meant the grant of a feud or fee;
that Is, a barony or knight's fee, for which certain services
were due from the feoffee to the feoffor. By custom it
came afterwards to signify also a grant (with livery of
seisin) of a free inheritance to a man and his heirs, refer-
ring rather to the perpetuity of the estate than to the
feudal tenure. 1 Reeve, Eng.Law, 90, 91. It was for ages
the only method (in ordinary use) for conveying the free-
hold of land in possession, but has now fallen in great
measure into disuse, even in England, having been almost
entirely supplanted by some of that class of conveyances
founded on the statute law of the realm. 1 Steph.Comm.
467, 468; Dane, Abr. c. 104; Stearn, Real Act. 2; Green v.
Liter, 8 Cranch, U.S., 229, 3 L. Ed. 545.

## FEOFFMENT TO USES

A feoffment of lands
to one person to the use of another.
In such case the feoffee was bound in conscience to hold
the lands according to the use, and could himself derive no
benefit. Sometimes such feoffments were made to the use
of the feoffer. The effect of such conveyance was entirely
changed by the statute of uses. See Wms.R.P., 6th Ed.,
155; 2 Sand.Us. 13; Watk.Conv. 288.

## FEOFFOR

The person making a feoffment, or
enfeoffing another in fee. 2 Bl. Comm. 310; Litt.
§§ 1, 57.

## FEOH

This Saxon word meant originally cattle,
and thence property or money, and, by a second
transition, wages, reward, or fee. It was probab-
ly the original form from which the words "feod,"
"feudum," "fief," "feu," and "fee" (all meaning a
feudal grant of land) have been derived. Spel-
man, Feuds.
FEONATIO, In forest law, the fawning season
of deer.

speaking, days or seasons during which free-born
Romans suspended their political transactions and

a cessation from labor.
All ferice were thus dies nefasti. All fence were divided
into two classes,—"ferice publicce" and "ferice privatce."
The latter were only observed by single families or individ-
uals, in commemoration of some particular event which had
been of importance to them or their ancestors. Smith,
Diet. Anti q.

Roman empire. In the later Roman empire the single days
occurring at intervals of a week apart, commencing with
the seventh day of the ecclesiastical year, were so called.

Bl.Comm. 117.

## FEUDAL COURTS

In the 12th century a lord
qua lord had the right to hold a court for his
tenants.
In the 13th century, they became of less importance and
for three reasons: The feudal principle would have led to
a series of courts one above the other, and the dominions
of the large landowners were usually scattered, so that
great feudal courts became impossible. The growth of the
jurisdiction of the king's court removed the necessity for
feudal courts. All the incidents of the feudal system came
to be regarded in a commercial spirit-as property. Its
jurisdiction became merely appendant to landowning. 1
Holdsw.Hist.E.L. 64.

## FEUDAL LAW

The body of jurisprudence re-
lating to feuds; the real-property law of the feud-
al system; the law anciently regulating the prop-
erty relations of lord and vassal, and the creation,
incidents, and transmission of feudal estates.
The body of laws and usages constituting the "feudal
law" was originally customary and unwritten, but a com-
pilation was made in the twelfth century, called "Feodarum
Consuetudines," which has formed the basis of later
digests. The feudal law prevailed over Europe from the
twelfth to the fourteenth century, and was introduced into
England at the Norman Conquest, where it formed the
entire basis of the law of real property until comparatively
modern times. Survivals of the feudal law, to the present
day, so affect and color that branch of jurisprudence as to
require a certain knowledge of the feudal law in order to
the perfect comprehension of modern tenures and rules of
real-property law.

## FEUDAL POSSESSION

The equivalent of "sei-
sin" under the feudal system.

## FEUDAL SYSTEM

The system of feuds. A po-
litical and social system which prevailed through-
out Europe during the eleventh, twelfth, and thir-
teenth centuries, and is supposed to have grown,
out of the peculiar usages and policy of the Teu-
tonic nations who overran the continent after the
fall of the Western Roman Empire, as developed
and possibly furthered by notions taken from the
Roman jurisprudence,
It was introduced into England, in its completeness, by
William I., A. D. 1085, though it may have existed in a
rudimentary form among the Saxons before the Conquest.
It formed the entire basis of the real-property law of Eng-
land in medieval times; and survivals of the system,- in
modern days, so modify and color that branch of jurispru-
dence, both in England and America, that many of its
principles require for their complete understanding a
knowledge of the feudal system. The feudal system orig-
inated in the relations of a military chieftain and his fol-
lowers, or king and nobles, or lord and vassals, and espe-
cially their relations as determined by the bond established
by a grant of land from the former to the latter. From
this it grew into a complete and intricate complex of rules
for the tenure and transmission of real estate, and of cor-
related duties and services; while, by tying men to the
land and to those holding above and below them, it created
a close-knit hierarchy of persons, and developed an aggre-
gate of social and political institutions. For an account of
the feudal system in its juristic relations, see 2 Bl.Comm.
44; 1 Steph.Comm. 160; 3 Kent, Comm. 487; Spel.Feuds;
Litt.Ten.; Su11.Lect. ; Spence, Eq.Jur.; 1 Washb.Real.
Prop. 15; Dalr.Feu.Prop. For its political and social rela-
tions, see Hall, Middle Ages; Maine, Anc.Law; Rob. Car.
V.; Montesq. Esprit des Lois, bk. 30; Guizot, Hist.Civili-
zation.

## FEUDAL TENURES

The tenures of real estate
under the feudal system, such as knight-service,
socage, villenage, etc.

## FEUDALISM

The feudal system; the aggregate
of feudal principles and usages.
It is a vague term to describe a congeries of customs and
legal relations by no means uniform throughout Europe
and never static. But feudalism had one basic character-
istic traceable through all its variations: It rested on
relations to land, the primary factor in a relatively primi-
tive agrarian civilization. United States v. Forness, C.C.A.
N.Y., 125 F.2d 928, 933.

## FEUDALIZE

## FEUDORUM LIBER

The book of feuds.
This was a compilation of feudal law, prepared by order
of the emperor Frederick I., and published at Milan in
1170. It comprised five books, of which only the first two
are now extant with fragmentary portions of the others,
printed at the end of modern editions of the Corpus Juris
Civilis. Giannone, b. 13, c. 3; Cruise, Dig. prel. diss. c.
1, 31.
FEUDORUM LIBEL The Books of Feuds pub-
lished during the reign of Henry about the
The particular customs of Lombardy as to feuds began
about the year 1152, to be the standard of authority to
other nations, by reason of the greater refinement with
which that branch of learning had been there cultivated.
This compilation was probably known in England, but does
not appear to have had any other effect than to influence
English lawyers to the more critical study of their own
tenures, and to induce them to extend the learning of real
property so as to embrace more curious matter of similar
kind. 2 Reeves, Hist.Eng.Law, 55.

## FEUDUM

L. Lat. A feud, fief, or fee. A right
of using and enjoying forever the lands of an-
other, which the lord grants on condition that
the tenant shall render fealty, military duty, and
other services. Spelman. It is not properly the
land, but a right in the land.
This form of the word is used by the feudal writers. The
earlier English writers generally prefer the form feodum.
There was an older word feum.
Its use by the Normans is exceedingly obscure. "Feudal"
was not in their vocabulary. Usually it denoted a stretch
of land, rarely a tenure or mass of rights. It came to be
applied to every person who had heritable rights in land.
Maitl.Domesday Book and Beyond 152.

## FICTIO

In Roman law, a fiction; an assumption
or supposition of the law.
"Fictio" in the old Roman law was properly a term of
pleading, and signified a false averment on the part of the
plaintiff which the defendant was not allowed to traverse;
as that the plaintiff was a Roman citizen, when in truth
he was a foreigner. The object of the fiction was to give
the court jurisdiction. Maine, Anc.Law, 25.

## FICTIO CEDIT VERITATI. FICTIO JURIS NON EST UBI VERITAS

Fiction yields to truth.
Where there is truth, fiction of law exists not 11
Co. 51.

## FICTIO EST CONTRA VERITATEM, SED PRO VERITATE HABETUR

truth, but it is to be esteemed truth.

## FICTIO JURIS NON EST UBI VERITAS

## FICTIO LEGIS INIQUE OPERATUR ALICUI DAMNUM VEL INJURIAM

A legal fiction does
not properly work loss or injury. 2 Coke, 35; 3
Coke, 36; Broom, Max. 129; Gilb. 223. Fiction of
law is wrongful if it works loss or injury to any-
one.
law injures no one. 2 Rolle, 502: 3 Bl.Comm. 43;
Low v. Little, 17 Johns. N.Y. 348.

## FICTION

An assumption or supposition of law
that something which is or may be false is true,
or that a state of facts exists which has never
really taken place. New Hampshire Strafford
Bank v. Cornell, 2 N.H. 324; Hibberd v. Smith,
67 Cal. 547, 4 P. 473, 56 Am.Rep. 726; Murphy v.
Murphy, 190 Iowa 874, 179 N.W. 530, 533. An as-
sumption, for purposes of justice, of a fact that
does not or may not exist. Dodo v. Stocker, 74
Colo. 95, 219 P. 222, 223.
A rule of law which assumes as true, and will
not allow to be disproved, something which is
false, but not impossible. Best, Ev. 419.
These assumptions are of an innocent or even beneficial
character, and are made for the advancement of the ends
of justice. They secure this end chiefly by the extension of
procedure from cases to which it is applicable to other cases
to which it is not strictly applicable, the ground of inap-
plicability being some difference of an immaterial char-
acter. Brown.
Fictions are to be distinguished from presumptions of
law. By the former, something known to be false or unreal
is assumed as true ; by the latter, an inference is set up,
which may be and probably is true, but which, at any rate,
the law will not permit to be controverted. It may also
be said that a presumption is a rule of law prescribed for
the purpose of getting at a certain conclusion, though
arbitrary, where the subject is intrinsically liable to doubt
from the remoteness, discrepancy, or actual defect of
proofs.
Fictions are also to be distinguished from estoppels; an
estoppel being the rule by which a person is precluded
from asserting a fact by previous conduct inconsistent
therewith on his own part or the part of those under whom
he claims, or by an adjudication upon his rights which he
cannot be allowed to question.
Best distinguishes legal fictions from presumptions juris
et de jure, and divides them into three kinds,—affirmative
or positive fictions, negative fictions, and fictions by rela-
tion. Best, Pres. p. 27, 24.

## FICTION OF LAW

is assumed to be true. Ryan v. Motor Credit Co.,
130 N.J.Eq. 531, 23 A.2d 607, 621.

43 A.L.R. 46. Feigned, imaginary, not real, false,
not genuine, nonexistent. Bill alleging that
amount of mortgage sought to be canceled was
"fictitious" held to allege that mortgage was with-
out consideration. Kinney v. Kinney, 230 Ala. 558,
161 So. 798, 800. Arbitrarily invented and set up,
to accomplish an ulterior object. West Virginia

## FICTITIOUS NAME

A counterfeit, feigned, or
pretended name taken by a person, differing in
some essential particular from his true name,

mislead. Pollard v. Fidelity F. Ins. Co., 1 S.D. 570,
47 N.W. 1060; Carlock v. Cagnacci, 88 Cal. 600,
26 P. 597; Mangan v. Schuylkill County, 273 Pa.
310, 116 A. 920, 921.

## FICTITIOUS PAYEE

Negotiable instrument is
drawn to fictitious payee whenever payee named
in it has no right to it, and its maker does not in-
tend that such payee shall take anything by it;
whether name of payee used by maker is that of
person living or dead or one who never existed is
immaterial. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. of Cali-
fornia v. Wells Fargo Bank & Union Trust Co.,
1 Cal.App.2d 694, 37 P.2d 483.
"Fictitiousness" depends on the intention to pay,
rather than on the payee's existence. Norton v.
City Bank & Trust Co., C.C.A.Va., 294 F. 839, 844;
Mueller & Martin v. Liberty Ins. Bank, 187 Ky.
44, 218 S.W. 465, 466.

## FICTITIOUS PERSON

named as payee in a check has no right to it or its
proceeds because the drawer of it so intended.

Fla. 228, 9 So.2d 810, 811, 812.

## FICTITIOUS PLAINTIFF

A person appearing
in the writ or record as the plaintiff in a suit, but
who in reality does not exist, or who is ignorant
of the suit and of the use of his name in it. It is
a contempt of court to sue in the name of a ficti-
tious party. See 4 Bl.Comm. 134.

## FICTITIOUS PROMISE

See Promise.

## FIDE-COMMISSARY

A term derived from the
Latin "fidei-commissarius," and occasionally used
by writers on equity jurisprudence as a substitute
for the law French term "cestui, que trust," as
being more elegant and euphonious. See Brown
v. Brown, 83 Hun, 160, 31 N.Y.S. 650.

## FIDEI-COMMISSARIUS

In the civil law, this
term corresponds nearly to our "cestui que trust?'
It designates a person who has the real or bene-
ficial interest in an estate or fund, the title or
administration of whieh is temporarily confided to
another. See Story, Eq.Jur. § 966; 1 Greenl.Cruise,
Dig. 295.
According to Du Cange, the term was some-
times used to denote the executor of a will.

## FIDEI-COMMISSUM

In the civil law, a species
of trust; being a gift of property (usually by will)
to a person, accompanied by a request or direction
of the donor that the recipient will transfer the
property to another, the latter being a person not
capable of taking directly under the will or gift.
In re Courtin, 144 La. 971, 81 So. 457, 459; Suc-
cession of Reilly, 136 La. 347, 67 So. 27, 33; Gor-
tario v. Cantu, 7 Tex. 44.

## FIDE-JUBERE

In the civil law, to order a thing
upon one's faith; to pledge one's self; to become
surety for another. Fide-jubes? Fide-jubeo: Do
you pledge yourself ? I do pledge myself. Inst.
3, 16, L One of the forms of stipulation.
himself as an additional security for another. This
giving security does not destroy the liability of the
principal, but adds to the security of the surety.
Vicat, Voc.Jur.; Hallifax, Annals, b. 2, c. 16, n. 10.

## FIDE-JUSSOR

In Roman law, a guarantor; one
who becomes responsible for the payment of an-
other's debt, by a stipulation which binds him to
discharge it if the principal debtor fails to do so.
Mackeld.Rom.Law, § 452; 3 Bl.Comm. 108. He dif-
fers from a co-obligor in this, that the latter is
equally bound to a debtor, with his principal, while
the former is not liable till the principal has failed
to fulfil his engagement; Dig. 12, 4, 4; 16, 1, 13;
24, 3, 64; 38, 1, 37; 50, 17, 110; 6, 14, 20; Hall,
Pr. 33; Dunl.Adm.Pr. 300; Clerke, Prax. tit. 63.
The obligation of the fide-jussor was an accessory con-
tract; for, if the principal obligation was not previously
contracted, his engagement then took the name of man-

tyship giving the "festuca" or "vadium." 2
Holdsw.Hist.E.L. 73.
served. An agent must not violate the confidence
reposed in him. Story, Ag. § 192; Coolidge v.

## FIDES SERVANDA EST; SIMPLICITAS JURIS GENTIUM PRIEVALEAT

## FU)UCIA

In Roman law, an early form of mort-
gage or pledge, in which both the title and posses-
sion of the property were passed to the creditor by
a formal act of sale, (properly with the solemni-
ties of the transaction known as mancipatio,) there
being at the same time an express or implied
agreement on the part of the creditor to reconvey
the property by a similar act of sale provided the
debt was duly paid; but on default of payment,
,
the property became absolutely vested in the cred-
itor without foreclosure and without any right of
redemption.
In course of time, this form of security gave place to that
known as hypotheca, while the contemporary contract of
*gnus or pawn underwent a corresponding development.
See Mackeld.Rom.Law, § 334; Tomk. & J. Mod.Rom.Law,
182; Hadley, Rom.Law, 201-203; Pothier, Pand. tit.
"Fiducia."

## FIDUCIAL

An adjective having the same mean-
ing as "fiduciary;" as, in the phrase "public or
fiducial office." Ky.St. § 3752; Moss v. Rowlett,
112 Ky. 121, 65 S.W. 153.

## FIDUCIARIUS HIERES

See Fiduciary Heir.

## FIDUCIARIUS TUTOR

In Roman law, the eld-
er brother of an emancipated pupillus, whose fa-

## FIDUCIARY

The term is derived from the Ro-
man law, and means (as a noun) a person holding
the character of a trustee, or a character analo-
gous to that of a trustee, in respect to the trust
and confidence involved in it and the scrupulous
good faith and candor which it requires. Svanoe
v. Jurgens, 144 Ill. 507, 33 N.E. 955; Stoll v. King,
8 How.Prac.,N.Y., 299. A person having duty, cre-
ated by his undertaking, to act primarily for an-
other's benefit in matters connected with such un-
dertaking. Haluka v. Baker, 66 Ohio App. 308, 34
N.E.2d 68, 70. As an adjective it means of the
nature of a trust; having the characteristics of
a trust; analogous to a trust; relating to or
founded upon a trust or confidence.

## FIDUCIARY CAPACITY

One is said to act in
a "fiduciary capacity" or to receive money or con-
tract a debt in a "fiduciary capacity," when the
business which he transacts, or the money or
property which he handles, is not his own or for
his own benefit, but for the benefit of another per-
son, as to whom he stands in a relation implying
and necessitating great confidence and trust on
the one part and a high degree of good faith on
the other part. The term is not restricted to tech-
nical or express trusts, but includes also such of-
guardian, executor, or broker, a director of a
corporation, and a public officer. Templeton v.
Bockler, 73 Or. 494, 144 P. 405, 409; Madison Tp.
v. Dunkle, 114 Ind. 262, 16 N.E. 593. As used in
the Bankruptcy Act, § 17, subd. 4, 11 U.S.C.A. §
35, however, the term imports a technical trust,
actually and expressly constituted, and not such
merely as the law implies, and has no application
to debts or obligations merely because they were
created under circumstances in which trust or
confidence in the popular sense of those terms was
reposed in debtor. Culp v. Robey, Tex.Civ.App.,
294 S.W. 647, 651; American Agricultural Chem-
ical Co. v. Berry, 110 Me. 528, 87 A. 218, 45 L.R.A.,
N.S., 1106, Ann.Cas.1915A, 1293.

## FIDUCIARY CONTRACT

An agreement by
which a person delivers a thing to another on the
condition that he will restore it to him. Cicero,
de Ofjle, lib. 3, cap. 17; Lee. du Dr.Civ.Rom. § 237.
See Chapman v. Forsyth, 2 How., U.S., 202, 11 L.
Ed. 236; Fisk v. Sarber, 6 W. & S., Pa., 18; Mc-
Ginn v. Shaeffer, 7 Watts, Pa., 415.

## FIDUCIARY DEBT

A debt founded on or aris-
ing from some confidence or trust as distinguished
from a "debt" founded simply on contract. Mont-
gomery v. Phillips Petroleum Co., Tex.Civ.App.,
49 S.W.2d 967, 973.

## FIDUCIARY DEBTORS

Only public officers and
trustees, not agents, factors, commission men, and
the like, within the meaning of Bankruptcy Act,
§ 14, subd. 4, 11 U.S.C.A. § 32. Keefauver v. Hey
-enor, 163 App.Div. 531, 148 N.Y.S. 434, 435.

## FIDUCIARY HEIR

The Roman laws called a
fiduciary heir the person who was instituted heir,
and who was charged to deliver the succession to
a person designated by the testament. Merlin,
Rëpert. But Pothier, Pand. vol. 22, says that fidu-
ciarius hceres properly signifies the person to
whom a testator has sold his inheritance under
the condition that he should sell it to another.
FIDUCIARY OR CONFIDENTIAL RELATION.
A very broad term embracing both technical fidu-
ciary relations and those informal relations which
exist wherever one man trusts in or relies upon
another. State v. Gautier, 108 Fla. 390, 147 So.
240, 242. One founded on trust or confidence re-
posed by one person in the integrity and fidelity
of another. Kerrigan v. O'Meara, 71 Mont. 1, 227
P. 819, 821.
The origin of the confidence and the source of the
influence are immaterial. Quinn v. Phipps, 93 Fla. 805, 113
So. 419, 420, 54 A.L.R. 1173. The relations and duties
involved need not be legal but may be moral, social, domes-
tic, or merely personal. Trustees of Jesse Parker Williams
Hospital v. Nisbet, 191 Ga. 821, 14 S.E.2d 64, 76. See also,
Fiduciary Relation.

## FIDUCIARY RELATION

An expression includ-
ing both technical fiduciary relations and those
informal relations which exist whenever one man
trusts and relies upon another. Peckham v. John-
son, Tex.Civ.App., 98 S.W.2d 408, 416. It exists
where there is special confidence reposed in one-
who in equity and good conscience is bound to-
of one reposing the confidence. Neagle v. Mc-
Mullen, 334 Ill. 168, 165 N.E. 605, 608. A relation
subsisting between two persons in regard to a
business, contract, or piece of property, or in re-
gard to the general business or estate of one of
them, of such a character that each must repose
trust and confidence in the other and must exer-
cise a corresponding degree of fairness and good
faith.
Out of such a relation, the law raises the rule that nei-
ther party may exert influence or pressure upon the other,
take selfish advantage of his trust, or deal with the subject-
matter of the trust in such a way as to benefit himself or
prejudice the other except in the exercise of the utmost
good faith and with the full knowledge and consent of that
other, business shrewdness, hard bargaining, and astute-
ness to take advantage of the forgetfulness or negligence
of another being totally prohibited as between persons
standing in such a relation to each other. Examples of
fiduciary relations are those existing between attorney and
client, guardian and ward, principal and agent, executor
and heir, trustee and cestui que trust, landlord and tenant,
etc. Robins v. Hope, 57 Cal. 497; Thomas v. Whitney, 186
Ill. 225, 57 N.E. 808; Central Nat. Bank v. Connecticut Mut.
L. Ins. Co., 104 U.S. 68, 26 L.Ed. 693. The relation need
not be legal, but may be moral, social, domestic, or merely
personal. Miranovitz v. Gee, 163 Wis. 246, 157 N.W. 790,
792; Higgins v. Chicago Title & Trust Co., 312 Ill. 11, 143
N.E. 482, 484. It is one in which, if a wrong arise, the
same remedy exists against the wrongdoer on behalf of the
principal as would exist against a trustee on behalf of a
cestui que trust. Smith v. Smith, 222 Mass. 102, 109 N.E.
830, 832. Sometimes confidential and fiduciary relations are
regarded as synonymous; In re Cover's Estate, 188 Cal.
133, 204 P. 583, 588; but on the other hand, a technical
distinction may be taken between a "fiducial relation"
which is more correctly applicable to legal relationships
between parties, such as guardian and ward, administra-
tor and heirs, and other similar relationships, and a "con-
fidential relation" which includes the legal relationships,
and also every other relationship wherein confidence is
rightfully reposed and is exercised. Roberts v. Parsons,
195 Ky. 274, 242 S.W. 594, 596.

## FIEF

FIEF D'HAUBERT (or D'HAUBERK). Fr. In

Mack, 92 Vt. 103, 102 A. 58, 59; but not a one-
acre lot used for cultivating vegetables; Simons
v. Lovell, 7 Heisk., Tenn., 510. This term might
well be considered as definite and certain a de-
scription as "close," and might be used in law;
but it is not a usual description in legal proceed-
ings. 1 Chit.Gen.Pr, 160.
Armies away from the home base on an opera-
tional, hostile mission are in the "field". In re
Di Bartolo, D,C.N.Y., 50 F.Supp. 929, 933.

Includes the sphere of practical operation, as of an
organization or enterprise; also, the place or ter-
ritory where direct contacts, as with a clientele
may be made or first-hand knowledge may be gain-
ed; sphere of action or place of contest, either
literally or figuratively; hence, any scene of oper-
ations or opportunity for activity. State ex rel.
McPherson v. Snell, 168 Or. 153, 121 P.2d 930, 937,
FIELDAD, In Spanish law, sequestration. This
is allowed in six cases by the Spanish law where
the title to property is in dispute. Las Partidas,
pt. 3, tit. 3, 1. 1.

## FIERDING COURTS

Ancient Gothic courts of
an inferior jurisdiction, so called because four

ment debtor.
FIERI FACIAS DE BONIS ECCLESIASTIC'S.
When a sheriff to a common fi, fa. returns nulla
bona, and that the defendant is a beneficed clerk,
not having any lay fee, a plaintiff may issue a fi.
fa. de bonis ecclesiasticis, addressed to the bishop
of the diocese or to the archbishop, (during the
vacancy of the bishop's see,) commanding him to
make of the ecclesiastical goods and chattels be-
longing to the defendant within his diocese the
sum therein mentioned. 2 Chit.Archb.Pr. (12th
Ed.) 1062.

## FIERI FACIAS DE BONIS TESTATORIS

The
writ issued on an ordinary judgment against an
executor when sued for a debt due by his testator.
If the sheriff returns to this writ nulla bona, and
a devastavit, (q. v.,) the plaintiff may sue out a

goods of the executor himself are seized. Sweet.

## FIERI FECI

Means I have caused to be made.
In practice, the return made by a sheriff or other
officer to a writ of fieri fackts, where he has col-
lected the whole, or a part, of the sum directed to

tually made, is expressed by the word "Satisfied"
indorsed on the writ.

## FIERI NON DEBET, (DEBUIT,) SED FACTUM VALET

It ought not to be done, but [if] done,
it is valid. Shep. Touch. 6; 5 Coke, 39; T.Raym.
58; 1 Strange, 526. A maxim frequently applied
in practice. Nichols v. Ketcham, 19 Johns., N.Y.,

## FIFTEENTHS

In English law, this was origin-
ally a tax or tribute, levied at intervals by act of
parliament, consisting of one-fifteenth of all the
movable property of the subject or personalty in
every city, township, and borough.
Under Edward III., the taxable property was assessed,
and the value of its fifteenth part (then about £29,000) was
recorded in the exchequer, whence the tax, levied on that
valuation, continued to be called a "fifteenth," although as
the wealth of the kingdom increased, the name ceased to
be an accurate designation of the proportion of the tax to
the value taxed. See 1 B1.Comm. 309; Co. 2d Inst. 77; 1
Poll. & Maitl. 604; Cowell.

## FIFTH DEGREE OF KINSHIP

The degree of
kinship between a deceased intestate and the chil-
dren of decedent's first cousin, sometimes desig-
nated as "first cousins once removed", was in the

227, 232.
An encounter, with blows or other personal violence,

P. 1072; Coles v. New York Casualty Co., 87 App. Div. 41,
83 N.Y.S. 1063. The term does not necessarily imply that
both parties, should give and take blows. It is sufficient
that they,voluntarily put their bodies in position with that
intent; State v. Gladden, 73 N.C. 155; Tate v. State, 46 Ga.

## FIGHTWITE

Sax. A mulct or fine for making
also by Cowell "forisfactura pugnce." The
amount was one hundred and twenty shillings.

hibits in courts and offices are fastened or filed
for the more safe-keeping and ready turning to

pers belonging thereto. Jackson v. Mobley, 157
Ala. 408, 47 So. 590.

142 P. 503, 505; Pendrey v. Brennan, 31 Idaho, 54,
169 P. 174, 175. It carries the idea of permanent
preservation as a public record. In re Gubelman,
C.C.A., 10 F.2d 926, 929.
The term "filed" is used to denote the paper placed with
the clerk, and assigned by law to his official keeping. Ex
parte Leifeste, 127 Tex.Cr.R. 445, 77 S.W.2d 675, 676.
"To file" a paper, on the part of a party, is to place it

A distinction was sometimes made, in the civil law,
between "filii" and "liberi;" the latter word including
grandchildren, (nepotes,) the former not. Inst. 1, 14, 5.
But, according to Paulus and Julianus, they were of
equally extensive import. Dig. 50, 16, 84; Id. 50, 16, 201.

from heat. Lavitt v. Hartford County Mut. Fire Ins. Co.,

A chattel attached to realty, In re

cessory to it and part and parcel of it. Farmers
& Merchants Bank v. Sawyer, 26 Ala.App. 520,
163 So. 657. And ordinarily the property of the
owner of the land. Hill.; Atlantic Refining Co. v.
Feinberg, 1 W.W.Harr., Del., 183, 112 A. 685, 687;
Red Diamond Clothing Co. v. Steidemann, 169 Mo.
App. 306, 152 S.W. 609, 617.
A. thing is deemed to be affixed to land when it is at-
tached to it by roots, imbedded in it, permanently resting
upon it, or permanently attached to what is thus perma-
nent, as by means of cement, plaster, nails, bolts, or
screws. Civ.Code Cal. § 660; Big Sespe Oil Co. v. Cochran,
C.C.A.Cal., 276 F. 216, 225.
Ordinarily, requisites are actual annexation to realty,
or something appurtenant thereto, appropriation to use or
purpose of realty, and intention to make article permanent
accession to freehold as gathered from nature of articles
affixed, relation and situation of person making annexa-
tion, structure and mode of annexation, and purpose or
use for which it has been made. Bankers Life Ins. Co. v.
Ohrt, 131 Neb. 858, 270 N.W. 497, 502.
It has been said, however, that a "fixture" formerly
meant any chattel which on becoming affixed to the soil
became a part of the realty; but it now means those things
which formed an exception to that rule and can be re-
moved by the person who affixed them to the soil, L.R. 4
Ex. 328; if they can be taken away without material in-
jury to the realty. Boise Ass'n of Credit Men v. Ellis, 26
Idaho, 438, 144 P. 6, 9, L.R.A.1915E, 917.
It has also been said that it is generally understood to
comprehend any article which a tenant has the power to
remove. Sheen v. Rickie, 5 Mees. & W. 174; Rogers v. Gil-
inger, 30 Pa. 185, 189, 72 Am. Dec. 694.
The general result seems to be that three views have
been taken. One is that "fixture" means something which
has been affixed to the realty, so as to become a part of it;
means something which appears to be a part of the realty,
but is not fully so; it is only a chattel fixed to it, but re-
movable. An intermediate view is that "fixture" means a
chattel annexed, affixed, to the realty, but imports noth-
ing as to whether it is removable; that is to be de-
termined by considering its circumstances and the relation
of the parties. Abbott; New Castle Theater Co. v. Ward,
57 Ind.App. 473, 104 N.E. 526, 527; Review Printing Co.
v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., 133 Minn. 213, 158 N.W. 39, 40.

regarding them is that which is expressed in the maxim,
"accessio cedit principali," "the accessory goes with, and
as part of, the principal subject-matter." Brown.
That which is fixed or attached to something
permanently as an appendage, and not removable.
Webster. Something fixed or immovable. Wor-
cester.

cept that the operation upon the casting, which it is de-
signed to facilitate, is an operation of grooving and plan-
ing, instead of drilling holes. Commonwealth Trust Co.
of Pittsburgh v. Harkins, 312 Pa. 402, 167 A. 278, 280.
Agricultural fixtures. Those annexed for the purpose
of farming. In re Shelar, D.C.Pa., 21 F.2d 136, 138.
Domestic fixtures. All such articles as a tenant attaches
to a dwelling house in order to render his occupation more
comfortable or convenient, and which may be separated
from it without doing substantial injury, such as furnaces,
stoves, cupboards, shelves, bells, gas fixtures, or things
merely ornamental, as painted wainscots, pier and chimney
glasses, although attached to the walls with screws, matble
chimney pieces, grates, beds nailed to the walls, window
blinds and curtains. Wright v. Du Bignon, 40 S.E. 747,
114 Ga. 765, 57 L.R.A. 669.
Trade fixtures. Articles placed in or attached to rented
buildings by the tenant, to prosecute the trade or business
for which he occupies the premises, or to be used in con-
nection with such business, or promote convenience and
efficiency in conducting it. Herkimer County L. & P. Co.
v. Johnson, 37 App.Div. 257, 55 N.Y.Supp. 924; Brown v.
Reno Electric L. & P. Co., C.C.Nev., 55 F. 231; North-
western Lumber & Wrecking Co. v. Parker, 125 Minn. 107,
145 N.W. 964, 965. Such chattels as merchants usually pos-
sess and annex to the premises occupied by them to en-
able them to store, handle, and display their goods, which
are generally removable without material injury to the
premises. Lovett v. Bermingham-Seaman-Patrick Co., 192

that is to say, as by a waiving of the hand for the purpose
of communicating information. Bergfeld v. Kansas City
Rys. Co., 285 Mo. 654, 227 S.W. 106, 110.

## FLOOR

A section of a building between hori-

outer walls. Leominster Fuel Co. v. Scanlon, 243
Mass. 126, 137 N.E. 271, 24 A.L.R. 1459.
The word "floor" may mean the mere bottom plane of an
inclosure or artificial structure, the surface on which we
walk, ride, or travel, or it may mean such surface or plane,
together with the timbers, framework, and materials which
enter into and form part of its construction. So of the
word "flooring," If used without reference to a structure
in its completed form, it would ordinarily convey the idea
of materials suitable for use in constructing a floor, or in
a narrower sense the boards or planks for covering the
framework of a floor. When used with reference to a
completed structure, it may mean either the materials of
which the floor is composed, or the completed floor struc-
ture. When not attempting to speak with technical, exact-
ness, the words "floor" and "flooring" may be, and often
are, used as synonymous or interchangeable terms, Cedar
Rapids & M. C. R. Co. v. City of Cedar Rapids, 173 Iowa
386, 155 N.W. 842; Missouri Pac, R. Co. v. Holt, C.C.A.
Ark. 293 F. 155, 157.
A term used metaphorically, in parliamentary
practice, to denote the exclusive right to address
the body in session.
A member who has been recognized by the chairman,
and who is in order, is said to "have the floor," until his
remarks are concluded. Similarly, the "floor of the house"
means the main part of the hall where the members sit,
as distinguished from the galleries, or from the corridors
or lobbies.
In England, the floor of a court is that part between the
judge's bench and the front row of counsel. Litigants ap-
pearing in person, in the high court or court of appeal, are
supposed to address the court from the floor.

the people in a town or shire.
It appears to have had judicial functions of a limited
nature, and also to have discharged political offices, such
as deliberating upon the affairs of the commonwealth or
complaining of misgovernment, and probably possessed
considerable powers of local self-government. The name
was also given to any sort of a popular assembly. See
Spelman; Manwood; Cunningham.

## FOLC-LAND

In Saxon law, land of the folk or
people. Land belonging to the people or the pub-
lic.
Folc-land was the property of the community. It might
be occupied in common, or possessed in severalty; and, in
the latter case, it was probably parceled out to individuals
in the folc-gemote or court of the district, and the grant
sanctioned by the freemen who were there present. But,
while it continued to be folc-land, it could not be alienated
in perpetuity; and therefore, on the expiration of the term
for which it had been granted, it reverted to the communi-
ty, and was again distributed by the same authority. It
was subject to many burdens and exactions from which
boc-land was exempt. Wharton.

## FOLD-SOKE

A feudal service which consisted
in the obligation of the tenant not to have a fold
of his own but to have his sheep lie in the lord's
fold.
He was said to be consuetus ad foldam, tried to his lord's
fold. The basis of his service is thus expressed by a re-
cent writer : "It is manure that the lord wants; the de-
mand for manure has played a large part in the history of
the human race." Maitland, Domesday Book 76. In East
Anglia the peasants had sheep enough to make this an im-
portant social institution; id. 442.

## FOLDAGE

A privilege possessed in some places
by the lord of a manor, which consists in the right

from this duty. Elton, Com. 45, 46.

## FOLIO

A leaf. In the ancient lawbooks it was
the custom to number the leaves, instead of the
pages; hence a folio would include both sides of
the leaf, or two pages. The references to these
books are made by the number of the folio, the
letters "a" and "b" being added to show which of
the two pages is intended; thus "Bracton, fol.
100a."
A large size of book, the page being obtained
by folding the sheet of paper once only in the bind-
ing. Many of the ancient lawbooks are folios.
When used in connection with legal documents,
it means a certain number of words varying from
72 to 100, but generally in the United States con-
sisting of 100. Reed v. Sackett, 135 Okl. 69, 273
P. 1002, 1004.
In pleading denying allegations of a specified
folio, it refers to a division in a document for pur-
pose of measurement or reference. Mahin v. Ma-

ulated that in consideration of the payment of

sion. Code Civil Proc.Cal. § 1159.
In many states, an entry effected without consent of

cumstances which amount to no more than a mere tres-
pass, is now technically considered "forcible," while a
detainer of the property consisting merely in the refusal to
surrender possession after a lawful demand, is treated as a
"forcible" detainer, the "force" required at common law
being now supplied by a mere fiction. See Vernon's Tex.
Ann.Civ.St. art. 3975; Goldsberry v. Bishop, 2 Duv., Ky.,
144; Wells v. Darby, 13 Mont. 504, 34 P. 1092; Willard

by defendant; the object of the law being to prevent the
disturbance of the public peace by the forcible assertion
of a private right. Gore v. Altice, 33 Wash. 335, 74 P. 556;
Eveleth v. Gill, 97 Me. 315, 54 A. 757; Harris v. Harris,

gery, chemistry, physics, and botany lend their
aid as necessity arises; and in some cases all
these branches of science are required to enable

imitation of another thing, with the intention of

spurious article. To counterfeit or make falsely.
Especially, to make a spurious written instru-
ment with the intention of fraudulently substitut-
ing it for another, or of passing it off as genuine;
or to fraudulently alter a genuine instrument to
another's prejudice; or to sign another person's
name to a document, with a deceitful and fraud-
ulent intent. In re Cross, D.C.N.C., 43 F. 520;
U. S. v. Watkins, 28 Fed.Cas. 445; Johnson v.
State, 9 Tex.App. 251; Longwell v. Day, 1 Mich.
N.P. 290.
To forge (a metaphorical expression, borrowed from the
occupation of the smith) means, properly speaking, no
more than to make or form, but in our law it is always
taken in an evil sense. 2 East, P. C. p. 852, c. 19, § 1.
To forge is to make in the likeness of something else;
to counterfeit is to make in imitation of something else,
with a view to defraud by passing the false copy for gen-
uine or original. Both words, "forged" and "counterfeit-
ed," convey the idea of similitude. State v. McKenzie, 42
Me. 392.
In common usage, however, forgery is almost always
predicated of some private instrument or writing, as a
deed, note, will, or a signature; and counterfeiting denotes
the fraudulent imitation of coined or paper money or some
substitute therefor.

## FORMEDON

An ancient writ in English law
which was available for one who had a right to
lands or tenements by virtue of a gift in tail.
It was in the nature of a writ of right, and was the
highest action that a tenant in tail could have; for he
could not have an absolute writ of right, that being con-
fined to such as claimed in fee-simple, and for that reason
this writ of formedon was granted to him by the statute
de donis, (Westm. 2, 13 Edw. I. c. 1,) and was emphatical-
ly called "his" writ of right. The writ was distinguished
into three species, viz. : Formedon in the descender, in the
remainder, and in the reverter. It was abolished in Eng-
land by St. 3 & 4 Wm. IV. c. 27. See 3 B1.Comm. 191; Co.
Litt. 316; Fitzh.Nat.Brev. 255.

## FORMEDON IN THE DESCENDER

formedon which lay where a gift was made in
tail, and the tenant in tail aliened the lands or
was disseised of them and died, for the heir in
tail to recover them, against the actual tenant
of the freehold. 3 Bl. Comm. 192.

## FORMEDON IN THE REMAINDER

A writ of
formedon which lay where a man gave lands to
another for life or in tail, with remainder to a
third person in tail or in fee, and he who had the
particular estate died without issue inheritable,
and a stranger intruded upon him in remainder,
and kept him out of possession. In this case he
in remainder, or his heir, was entitled to this
writ. 3 Bl. Comm. 192.

## FORMEDON IN THE REVERTER

A writ of
formedon which lay where there was a gift in
tail, and afterwards, by the death of the donee
or his heirs without issue of his body, the re-
version fell in upon the donor, his heirs or as-
signs. In such case, the reversioner had this
writ to recover the lands. 3 Bl. Comm. 192.

ardy," that a man cannot be brought into danger
of his life or limb for the same offense more than
once, is fundamental common law and constitu-

against his being again tried for the same of-
fense, and not against the peril of second punish-
ment. State v. Fredlund, 200 Minn. 44, 273 N.W.
353, 355, 113 A.L.R. 215.

## FORMS OF ACTION

This term comprehends
the various classes of personal action at common
law, viz.: trespass, case, trover, detinue, replevin,
covenant, debt, assumpsit, scire facias, and re-
vivor, as well as the nearly obsolete actions of
account and annuity, and the modern action of
mandamus.
They are now abolished in England by the Judicature
Acts of 1873 and 1875, and in many of the states of the
United States, where a uniform course of proceeding under
codes of procedure has taken their place. But the prin-
ciples regulating the distinctions between the common-law
actions are still found applicable even where the technical
forms are abolished.

## FORMULIE

In Roman law, when the legis ac-
tiones were proved to be inconvenient, a mode of
procedure called "per formulas," (i. e., by means
of formulce,) was gradually introduced, and even-
tually the legis actiones were abolished by the
Lex .Xbutia, B. C. 164, excepting in a very few
exceptional matters.
The formulce were four in number, namely : (1) The
Demonstratio, wherein the plaintiff stated, i. e., showed,
the facts out of which his claim arose; (2) the Intentio,
where he made his claim against the defendant; (3) the
Adjudicatio, wherein the judex was directed to assign or
adjudicate the property or any portion or portions thereof
according to the rights of the parties; and (4) the Condem-
natio, in which the judex was authorized and directed to
condemn or to acquit according as the facts were or were
not proved. These formulae were obtained from the
magistrate, (in jure,) and were thereafter proceeded with
before the judex, (in judicio). Brown. See Mackeld.Rom.
Law, § 204.

## FORMULARIES

persons if the woman is married, whether the
man is married or not. Banks v. State, 96 Ala.

commonly called the "act of God," is meant any accident
produced by physical causes which are irresistible; such
as a loss by lightning or storms, by the perils of the seas,
by inundations and earthquakes, or by sudden death or ill-
ness. By the latter is meant such an interposition of hu-
man agency as is, from its nature and power, absolutely
uncontrollable. Of this nature are losses occasioned by the
inroads of a hostile army, or by public enemies. Story,
Baffin. § 25. In Workmen's Compensation Acts fortuitous
event is accidental happening, or accident that takes place
without design or expectation, or thing that happens from
irresistible cause. The term is expressly defined in several

## FORUM NON CONVENIENS

The doctrine is
patterned upon the right of the court in the exer-
cise of its equitable powers to refuse the imposi-
tion upon its jurisdiction of the trial of cases even
though the venue is properly laid if it appears
that for the convenience of litigants and witness-
es and in the interest of justice the action should
be instituted in another forum where the action
might have been brought. Hayes v. Chicago, R. I.
& P. R. Co., D.C.Minn., 79 F.Supp. 821, 824. The
doctrine presupposes at least two forums in which
the defendant is amenable to process and fur-
nishes criteria for choice between such forums.
Wilson v. Seas Shipping Co., D.C.Pa., 78 F.Supp.
464, 465; Neal v. Pennsylvania R. Co., D.C.N.Y., 77
F.Supp. 423, 424. The application of the doctrine
rests in the sound discretion of the court and the
factors to be considered in the doctrine are the
private interests of the litigant and the interest of
the public. Cullinan v. New York Cent. R. Co., D.
C.N.Y., 83 F.Supp. 870, 871. And a court, either
state or federal, will generally decline to interfere
with or control by injunction or otherwise the
management of internal affairs of a corporation

controversies as to such matters to courts of state
of domicile. Garrett v. Phillips Petroleum Co.,
Tex.Civ.App., 218 S.W.2d 238, 240; Murray v. Un-
ion Pac. R. Co., D.C.Ill., 77 F.Supp. 219; Kelley v.

288 U.S. 123, 53 S.Ct. 295, 77 L.Ed. 652, 89 A.L.R.
The rule is an equitable one embracing the discretionary
power of a court to decline to exercise jurisdiction which it
has over a transitory cause of action when it believes that
the action may be more appropriately and justly tried
elsewhere. Leet v. Union Pac. R. Co., 155 P.2d 42, 44, 25
Ca1.2d 605.
In determining whether doctrine should be applied, court
should consider relative ease of access to sources of proof,
availability of compulsory process for attendance of unwill-
ing witnesses, cost of obtaining attendance of willing wig
nesses, possibility of view of premises, and all other practi-
cal problems that make trial easy, expeditious and inex-
pensive. Di Lella v. Lehigh Val. R. Co., D.C.N.Y., 7 F.R.
D. 192, 193.

This term may mean either (1) the
forum of the defendant, that is, of his residence

in controversy, that is, of the place where the
property is situated. The ambiguity springs from
the fact that rei may be the genitive of either
reus or res.

res fiesta (thing done;) the place where an act
is done, considered as a place of jurisdiction and
remedy. 2 Kent, Comm. 463.

trick for purpose of obtaining service. Shields v.
Shields, 115 Mont. 140, 139 P.2d 528, 530, 531. It
does not necessarily mean physical presence: de-
fendant who, after removal of action for breach
of contract to federal court, entered general ap-
pearance, defended on the merits, and filed coun-
terclaim, was "found" in the district. Freeman v.
Bee Mach. Co., Mass., 319 U.S. 448, 63 S.Ct. 1146,
1149, 87 L.Ed. 1509.
As applied to a corporation it is necessary that

## FOUR CORNERS

The face of a written instru-

That which is contained on the face of a deed (without
any aid from the knowledge of the circumstances under
which it is made) is said to be within its four corners, be-
cause every deed is still supposed to be written on one en-
tire skin, and so to have but four corners.
To look at the four corners of an instrument is to ex-
amine the whole of it, so as to construe it as a whole,
without reference to any one part more than another. 2
Smith, Lead.Cas. 295.

Pol. Ec. 260.

## FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT

The Fourteenth
Amendment of the constitution of the United
States.

ed States, as distinct from that of the states; forbids the
making or enforcement by any state of any law abridging
the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United
States; and secures all "persons" against any state action
which is either deprivation of life, liberty, or property
without due process of law or denial of the equal protec-
tion of the laws.

mann v. Schiermeyer, 111 Mo. 404, 19 S.W. 487.

## FRANCHISE

A special privilege conferred by
government on individual or corporation, and
which does not belong to citizens of country gen-
erally of common right. Elliott v. City of Eugene,
135 Or. 108, 294 P. 358, 360. In England it is de-
fined to be a royal privilege in the hands of a
subject.
A "franchise," as used by Blackstone in defining quo
warranto, (3 Corn. 262 [4th Am. Ed.] 322), had reference
to a royal privilege or branch of the king's prerogative
subsisting in the hands of the subject, and must arise from
the king's grant, or be held by prescription, but today we
understand a franchise to be some special privilege con-
ferred by government on an individual, natural or artificial,
which is not enjoyed by its citizens in general. State v.
Fernandez, 106 Fla. 779, 143 So. 638, 639, 86 A.L.R. 240.
In this country a franchise is a privilege or immunity of
a public nature, which cannot be legally exercised with-
out legislative grant. To be a corporation is a franchise.
The various powers conferred on corporations are fran-
chises. The execution of a policy of insurance by an in-
surance company, and the issuing a bank-note by an in-
corporated bank, are franchises. People v. Utica Ins. Co.,
15 Johns., N.Y., 387, 8 Am.Dec. 243. But it does not em-
brace the property acquired by the exercise of the fran-
chise. Bridgeport v. New York & N. H. R. Co., 36 Conn.
255, 4 Am. Rep. 63. Nor involve interest in land acquired
by grantee. Whitbeck v. Funk, 140 Or. 70, 12 P.2d 1019,
1020. In a popular sense, the political rights of subjects
and citizens are franchises, such as the right of suffrage,
etc. Pierce v. Emery, 32 N.H. 484; State v. Black Dia-
mond Co., 97 Ohio St. 24, 119 N.E. 195, 199, L.R.A.1918E,
Elective Franchise. The right of suffrage; the right or
privilege of voting in public elections.
Exclusive Franchise. See Exclusive Privilege or Fran-
chise.
General and Special. The charter of a corporation is its
"general" franchise, while a "special" franchise consists
in any rights granted by the public to use property for a
public use but with private profit. Lord v. Equitable Life
Assur. Soc., 194 N.Y. 212, 87 N.E. 443, 22 L.R.A.,N.S., 420.
Personal Franchise. A franchise of corporate existence,
or one which authorizes the formation and existence of a
corporation, is sometimes called a "personal" franchise,
as distinguished from a "property" franchise, which au-
thorizes a corporation so formed to apply its property to
some particular enterprise or exercise some special privi-
lege in its employment, as, for example, to construct and
operate a railroad. See Sandham v. Nye, 9 Misc.Rep. 541,
30 N.Y.S. 552.
Secondary Franchises. The franchise of corporate exist-
ence being sometimes called the "primary" franchise of
a corporation, its "secondary" franchises are the special
and peculiar rights, privileges, or grants which it may re-
ceive under its charter or from a municipal corporation,
such as the right to use the public streets, exact tolls,
collect fares, etc. State v. Topeka Water Co., 61 Kan.
547, 60 P. 337; Virginia Canon Toll Road Co. v. People,
22 Colo. 429, 45 P. 398, 37 L.R.A. 711. The franchises of a
corporation are divisible into (1) corporate or general
franchises; and (2) "special or secondary franchises."
The former is the franchise to exist as a corporation, while
the latter are certain rights and privileges conferred upon
existing corporations. Gulf Refining Co. v. Cleveland Trust
Co., 166 Miss. 759, 108 So. 158, 160.
Special Franchises. See Secondary Franchises, supra.

## FRANCHISE TAX

A tax on the franchise of a
corporation, that is, on the right and privilege of
carrying on business in the character of a cor-
poration, for the purposes for which it was creat-
ed, and in the conditions which surround it. In re
Commercial Safe Deposit Co. of Buffalo, 148 Misc.
527, 266 N.Y.S. 626.
Though the value of the franchise, for purposes of taxa-
tion, may be measured by the amount of business done, or
the amount of earnings or dividends, or by the total value
of the capital or stock of the corporation in excess of its
tangible assets, a franchise tax is not a tax on either prop-
erty, capital, stock, earnings, or dividends. Home Ins. Co.
v. New York, 134 U.S. 594, 10 S.Ct. 593, 33 L.Ed. 1025;
Worth v. Petersburg R. Co., 89 N.C. 305; People v. Knight,
174 N.Y. 475, 67 N.E. 65, 63 L.R.A. 87; Greene v. Louis-
ville & I. R. Co., 244 U.S. 499, 37 S.Ct. 673, 678, 61 L.Ed.
1280, Ann.Cas.1917E, 88; American Refining Co. v. Staples,
Tex.Com.App., 269 S.W. 420, 421. Nor a tax on franchise
in technical sense, but on all intangible property of such a
corporation, not otherwise taxed, used in state as compo-
nent part of corporation's entire system. Western Union
Telegraph Co. v. Weaver, D.C.Neb., 5 F.Supp. 493, 497.
It is tax on intangible values inhering to business and
added value given to tangible property, being "ad valorem"
as distinguished from "excise" or "privilege" tax. State
Tax Commission v. Petroleum Exploration, 253 Ky. 119, 68
S.W.2d 777.

In English law, free alms.
A spiritual tenure whereby religious corporations,
aggregate or sole, held lands of the donor to them
and their successors forever.
They were discharged of all other except religious serv-
ices, and the trinoda necessitas. It differs from tenure by
divine service, in that the latter required the performance
of certain divine services, whereas the former, as its name
imports, is free. This tenure is expressly excepted in the
12 Car. II. c. 24, § 7, and therefore still subsists in some
few instances. 2 Broom & H. Comm. 203.

## FRANK BANK

In old English law, free bench.
Litt. § 166; Co. Litt. 110b. See Free-Bench.

## FRANK-CHASE

A liberty of free chase enjoyed
by any one, whereby all other persons having
ground within that compass are forbidden to cut
down wood, etc., even in their own demesnes, to
the prejudice of the owner of the liberty. Cowell.
See Chase.

## FRANK-FEE

Freehold lands exempted from all
services, but not from homage; lands held other-
wise than in ancient demesne. That which a man
holds to himself and his heirs, and not by such
service as is required in ancient demesne, accord-
ing to the custom of the manor. Cowell.

## FRANK FERM

In English law, a species of es-
tate held in socage, said by Britton to be "lands
and tenements whereof the nature of the fee is

manded." Britt. c. 66; 2 Bl.Comm. 80.

## FRANK-MARRIAGE

A species of entailed es-
tates, in English law, now grown out of use, but
still capable of subsisting.
When tenements are given by one to another, together
with a wife, who is a daughter or cousin of the donor, to
hold in frank-marriage, the donees shall have the tene-
ments to them and the heirs of their two bodies begotten,
i. e., in special tail. For the word "frank-marriage,"
ex vi termini, both creates and limits an inheritance, not
only supplying words of descent, but also terms of procre-
ation. The donees are liable to no service except fealty,
and a reserved rent would be void, until the fourth de-
gree of consanguinity be passed between the issues of the
donor and donee, when they were capable by the law of
the church of intermarrying. Litt. § 19; 2 BI.Comm. 115.

## FRANK-PLEDGE

or surety for freemen; that is, the pledge, or

## FRANKING PRIVILEGE

The privilege of send-
ing certain matter through the public mails with-
out payment of postage, in pursuance of a per-
sonal or official privilege.

association organized and carried on for the mu-
tual aid and benefit of its members, not for prof-

istic form of work, and a representative govern-
ment, makes provision for the payment of death
benefits, and (sometimes) for benefits in case of
accident, sickness, or old age, the funds therefor

v. Crow Wing County, 196 Minn. 194, 264 N.W.
779, 780. Any kind of artifice employed by one
person to deceive another. Goldstein v. Equitable
Life Assur. Soc. of U. S., 160 Misc. 364, 289 N.Y.S.

farious means which human ingenuity can devise,
and which are resorted to by one individual to
get advantage over another by false suggestions
or by suppression of truth, and includes all sur-
prise, trick, cunning, dissembling, and any unfair
way by which another is cheated. Johnson v. Mc-

or by silence, by word of mouth, or by look or gesture.
People v. Gilmore, 345 Ill. 28, 177 N.E. 710, 717. Fraud,
as applied to contracts, is the cause of an error bearing
on a material part of the contract, created or continued by
artifice, with design to obtain some unjust advantage to
the one party, or to cause an inconvenience or loss to the
other. Civil Code La. art. 1847. Strauss v. Insurance Co.
of North America, 157 La. 661, 102 So. 861, 865; Jesse
French Piano & Organ Co. v. Gibbon, Tex.Civ.App., 180 S.
W. 1185, 1187.
Fraud, in the sense of a court of equity, properly in-
cludes all acts, omissions, and concealments which in-
volve a breach of legal or equitable duty, trust, or confi-
dence justly reposed, and are injurious to another, or by
which an undue and unconscientious advantage is taken
of another. 1 Story, Eq.Jur. § 187; Howard v. West Jersey
& S. S. R. Co., 102 N.J.Eq. 517, 141 A. 755, 757.
Fraud is either actual or constructive. Actual fraud
consists in deceit, artifice, trick, design, some direct and
active operation of the mind ; it includes cases of the in-
tentional and successful employment of any cunning, de-
ception, or artifice used to circumvent or cheat another;
it is something said, done, or omitted by a person with
the design of perpetrating what he knows to be a cheat or
deception. Constructive fraud consists in any act of com-
mission or omission contrary to legal or equitable duty,
trust, or confidence justly reposed, which is contrary to
good conscience and operates to the injury of another. Or,
as otherwise defined, it is an act, statement or omission
which operates as a virtual fraud on an individual, or
which, if generally permitted, would be prejudicial to the
public welfare, and yet may have been unconnected with
any selfish or evil design. Or, according to Story, construc-
tive frauds are such acts or contracts as, though not origi-
nating in any actual evil design or contrivance to perpe-
trate a positive fraud or injury upon other persons, are
yet, by their tendency to deceive or mislead other persons,
or to violate private or public confidence, or to impair or
injure the public interests, deemed equally reprehensible
with actual fraud. 1 Story, Eq.Jur. § 258. Code Ga.1882, §
3173 (Civ.Code 1910, § 4622) ; People v. Kelly, 35 Barb.,
N.Y., 457; Jackson v. Jackson, 47 Ga. 99; Massachusetts
Ben. L. Ass'n v. Robinson, 104 Ga. 256, 30 S.E. 918, 42 L.R.
A. 261; Allen v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co.,
269 Ill. 234, 109 N.E. 1035, 1038.
Fraud is also classified as fraud in fact and fraud in law.
The former is actual, positive, intentional fraud. Fraud
disclosed by matters of fact, as distinguished from con-
structive fraud or fraud in law. McKibbin v. Martin, 64
Pa. 356, 3 Am.Rep. 588; Cook v. Burnham, 3 Kan.App. 27,
44 P. 447. Fraud in law is fraud in contemplation of law;
fraud implied or inferred by law; fraud made out by con-
struction of law, as distinguished from fraud found by a
jury from matter of fact; constructive fraud (q. v.). See 2
Kent, Comm. 512-532; Delaney v. Valentine, 154 N.Y. 692,
49 N.E. 65; Lovato v. Catron, 20 N.M. 168, 148 P. 490, 492,
L.R.A.1915E, 451; Furst & Thomas v. Merritt, 190 N.C. 397,
130 S.E. 40, 43.
Fraud is also said to be legal or positive. The former is
fraud made out by legal construction or inference, or the
same thing as constructive fraud. Newell v. Wagness, 1 N.
D. 62, 44 N.W. 1014. Positive fraud is the same thing as
actual fraud. Douthitt v. Applegate, 33 Kan. 395, 6 P.
575, 52 Am.Rep. 533; Nocatee Fruit Co. v. Fosgate, C.C.A.
Fla., 12 F.2d 250, 252.
Actionable fraud. See Actionable.
Extrinsic or collateral fraud justifying equitable relief
against a judgment or decree means some intentional act
or conduct by which the prevailing party has prevented the
unsuccessful party from having a fair submission of the
controversy. Farley v. Davis, 10 Wash.2d 62, 116 P.2d 263,
Pious fraud is a subterfuge or evasion considered moral-
ly justifiable on account of the ends sought to be promoted;
particularly applied to an evasion or disregard of the laws
in the interests of religion or religious institutions, such
as circumventing the statutes of mortmain.
Statute of Frauds. This is the common designation of a
very celebrated English statute, (29 Car. II. c. 3,) passed in
1677, and which has been adopted, in a more or less modi-
fied form, in nearly all of the United States. Its chief
characteristic is the provision that no suit or action shall
be maintained on certain classes of contracts or engage-
ments unless there shall be a note or memorandum thereof
in writing signed by the party to be charged or by his
authorized agent. Its object was to close the door to the
numerous frauds and perjuries. It is more fully named as
the "statute of frauds and perjuries." Smith v. Morton,
70 Okl. 157, 173 P. 520, 521; Housley v. Strawn Merchan-
dise Co., Tex.Com.App., 291 S.W. 864, 867; Norman v. Bul-

## FRAUD IN TREATY

Arises where a person is
induced by some fraudulent representation or pre-
tense to execute the very instrument intended to
be executed but under a misrepresentation as to
the contents thereof. Meyers v. Murphy, 181 Md.
98, 28 A.2d 861, 862.

## FRAUD ORDER

A name given to orders issued
by the postmaster general, under Rev.St. §§ 3929,
4041, 39 U.S.C.A. §§ 259, 732, for preventing the use
of the mails as an agency for conducting schemes
for obtaining money or property by means of false
or fraudulent pretences, etc.
They are not restricted to schemes which lack all the ele-
ments of legitimate business, but the statute applies "when
a business, even if otherwise legitimate, is systematically
and designedly conducted upon the plan of inducing its
patrons by means of false representations to part with their
money in the belief that they are purchasing something
different from, superior to, and worth more than, what is
actually sold;" Harris v. Rosenberger, Mo., 145 F. 449, 16
C.C.A. 225, 13 L.R.A.,N.S., 762.
The fraud order is issued to the postmaster of the office
through which the person affected by it receives his mail.
It forbids the post-master to pay any postal money order
to the specified person, and instructs the postmaster to
return all letters to the senders if practicable, or if not, to
the dead letter office, stamped in either case with the word
"fraudulent." The method of testing the validity of the
fraud order is to apply to the federal court for an injunc-
tion to restrain the postmaster from executing it. The de-
cision of the postmaster-general is not the exercise of a
judicial function; if he exceeds his jurisdiction, the party
injured may have relief in equity; Degge v. Hitchcock, 229
U.S. 162, 33 S.Ct. 639, 57 L. Ed. 1135.

## FRAUDARE

general
sense, the transfer of property with an intent to
defraud creditors, lienors, or others. In a particu-
lar sense, the act of an administrator who wastes

## FRAUDULENT CONCEALMENT

The hiding or
suppression of a material fact or circumstance
which the party is legally or morally bound to
disclose. Magee v. Insurance Co., 92 U.S. 93, 23
L.Ed. 699; Small v. Graves, 7 Barb., N.Y., 578.
The test of whether failure to disclose material facts
constitutes fraud is the existence of a duty, legal or
equitable, arising from the relation of the parties ; failure
to disclose a material fact with intent to mislead or de-
fraud under such circumstances being equivalent to an
actual "fraudulent concealment." Newell Bros. v. Hanson,
97 Vt. 297, 123 A. 208, 210.
Fraudulent concealment justifying a rescission of a con-
tract is the intentional concealment of some fact known to
the party charged, which is material for the party injured
to know to prevent being defrauded; the concealment of a
fact which one is bound to disclose being the equivalent
of an indirect representation that such fact does not exist.
Long v. Martin, Tex.Civ.App., 234 S.W. 91, 94.
To suspend running of limitations, it means employment
of artifice, planned to prevent inquiry or escape investiga-
tion and mislead or hinder acquirement of information dis-
closing a right of action, and acts relied on must be of an
affirmative character and fraudulent. McNaughton v.
Rockford State Bank, 261 Mich. 265, 246 N.W. 84, 86.

458; Surratt v. Eskridge, 131 Va. 325, 108 S.E.

obligation incurred, and every judicial proceeding
taken or suffered by any _person unable to pay
his debts as they become due from his own mon-
eys, in favor of any creditor, with a view of giv-
ing such creditor a preference over other credi-
tors, shall be deemed fraudulent and void if the

& 33 Vict. c. 71, § 92.

## FRAUDULENT REPRESENTATION

A false
statement as to material fact, made with intent
that another rely thereon, which is believed by
other party and on which he relies and by which
he is induced to act and does act to his injury,
and statement is fraudulent if speaker knows
statement to be false or if it is made with utter
disregard of its truth or falsity. Osborne v. Sim-
mons, Mo.App., 23 S.W.2d 1102, 1104.
As basis for law action, establishment of rep-
resentation, falsity, scienter, deception, and injury,
is required. Gray v. Shell Petroleum Corporation,
212 Iowa, 825, 237 N.W. 460, 463.
But a promise made without intent to perform
constitutes "fraudulent representation," which
generally affords ground for rescission. Mitchell

Meyer v. Madreperla, 68 N.J.L. 258, 53 A. 477, 96
Am.St.Rep. 536; Smith v. Toth, 61 Ind.App. 42,

230 P. 883, 889.

## FREE AND EQUAL

As used in a constitutional
word "free" means that every one entitled to vote
should have a reasonable opportunity to do so,.
a reasonable manner of doing so, etc., and the
word "equal" means that every vote cast should
have its decisive effect in the selection or choice
to be made at the election. McKinney v. Barker,
180 Ky. 526, 203 S.W. 303, 304, L.R.A.1918E, 581.
The term means that the voter shall not be physi-
cally restrained in the exercise of his right of fran-
chise, by either civil or military authority, and
that every voter shall have the same right as
every other voter. Asher v. Arnett, 280 Ky. 347,
132 S.W.2d 772, 775.
A "free and equal" election is one at which every per-
son entitled to vote may do so if he desires, although it
can hardly be said that, if only a few are prevented from
voting, the election is not free and equal In the constitu-
tional sense. Wallbrecht v. Ingram, 164 Ky. 463, 175 S.W.
1022, 1026.
It is the essence of free elections that the right of suf-
frage be untrammeled and unfettered, and that the ballot
represent and express the electors' own intelligent judg-
ment and conscience, and there can be no "free election"
unless there is freedom of opinion. An election to be free
must be without coercion of any description or any de-
terrent from the elector's exercise of his free will by means
of any intimidation or influence whatever, although there
is no violence or physical coercion. Neelley v. Farr, 61
Colo. 485, 158 P. 458, 467, Ann.Cas.1918A, 23.

## FREE-BENCH

## FREE WHITE PERSONS

"Free white persons"
referred to in Naturalization Act, as amended by
Act July 14, 1870, has meaning naturally given t&
it when first used in 1 Stat. 103, c. 3, meaning all
persons belonging to the European races then
commonly counted as white, and their descend-
ants, including such descendants in other countries
to which they have emigrated.
It includes all European Jews, more or less intermixed
with peoples of Celtic, Scandinavian, Teutonic, Iberian,
Latin, Greek, and Slavic descent. It includes Magyars,
Lapps, and Finns, and the Basques and Albanians. It in-
cludes the mixed Latin, Celtic-Iberian, and Moorish inhab-
itants of Spain and Portugal, the mixed Greek, Latin,
Phoenician, and North African inhabitants of Sicily, and
the mixed Slav and Tarter inhabitants of South Russia.
It does not mean Caucasian race, Aryan race, or Indo-
European races, nor the mixed Indo-European, Dravidian,
Semitic and Mongolian peoples who inhabit Persia. A.
Syrian of Asiatic birth and descent will not be entitled to
become a naturalized citizen of the United States as being
a free white person. Ex parte Shahid, D.C.S.C., 205 F.
812, 813; United States v. Cartozian, D.C.Or., 6 F.2d 919,

ciety. Oney v. Oklahoma City, C.C.A.Okl., 120 F.
2d 861, 865.
FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND OF THE PRESS.
See Liberty.
FREEDOM OF THE CITY, In English law, this
phrase signifies immunity from county juris-
diction, and the privilege of corporate taxation
and self-government held under a charter from
the crown. This freedom is enjoyed of right, sub-
ject to the provision of the charter, and is often
conferred as an honor on princes and other dis-
tinguished individuals. The freedom of a city
carries the parliamentary franchise. Encyc. Dict.
The rights and privileges possessed by the bur-
gesses or freemen of a municipal corporation un-
der the old English law; now of little importance,
and conferred chiefly as a mark of honor. See 11
Chic. L. J. 357.
The phrase has no place in American law, and as fre-
quently used in addresses of welcome made to organiza-
tions visiting an American city, particularly by mayors,
has no meaning whatever except as an expression of good
will.
The form of the grant made by the city of New York
to Andrew Hamilton of Philadelphia as quoted at large in
13 Law Notes 150.

## FREEHOLD

An estate for life or in fee. Inter-
mountain Realty Co. v. Allen, 60 Idaho 228, 90 P.
2d 704, 706, 122 A.L.R. 647.
A "freehold estate" is a right of title to land
Cohn v. Litwin, 311 Ill.App. 55, 35 N.E.2d 410, 413.
An estate in land or other real property, of un-
certain duration; that is, either of inheritance or
which may possibly last for the life of the tenant
at the least, (as distinguished from a leasehold; )
and held by a free tenure, (as distinguished from
copyhold or villeinage.) Nevitt v. Woodburn, 175
Ill. 376, 51 N.E. 593; Railroad Co. v. Hemphill, 35
Miss. 22; Ralston Steel Car Co. v. Ralston, 112
Ohio St. 306, 147 N.E. 513, 516, 39 A.L.R. 334;
Lakeside Irr. Co. v. Markham Irr. Co., 116 Tex.
65, 285 S.W. 593, 596.
An oil and gas lease. Cravens v. Hubble, 375
Ill. 51, 30 N.E.2d 622, 623.
A 99-year lease renewable forever is a "freehold
estate". Baltimore & 0. R. Co. v. Carman, 71 Ohio
App. 508, 50 N.E.2d 358, 359.
Such an interest in lands of frank-tenement as may en-
dure not only during the owner's life, but which is cast
after his death upon the persons who successively represent
him, according to certain rules elsewhere explained. Such
persons are called "heirs," and he whom they thus repre-
sent, the "ancestor." When the interest extends beyond
the ancestor's life, it Is called a "freehold of inheritance,"
and, when it only endures for the ancestor's life, it is a
freehold not of inheritance.
An estate to be a freehold must possess these two qual-
ities ; (1) Immobility, that is, the property must be either
land or some interest issuing out of or annexed to land;
and (2) indeterminate duration, for, if the utmost period of
time to which an estate can endure be fixed and deter-
mined, it cannot be a freehold. Wharton.
Freehold in deed is the real possession of land or tene-
ments in fee, fee-tail, or for life. Freehold in law is the
right to such tenements before entry. The term has also
been applied to those offices which a man holds in fee or
for life. Mozl. & W. Diet. ; 1 Washb. R. P. 71, 637. See
Gage v. Scales, 100 Ill. 221; State v. Ragland, 75 N.C. 12,
L.R. 11 Eq. 454; Liberum Tenementum.
Determinable freeholds are estates for life, which may
determine upon future contingencies before the life for
which they are created expires, as if an estate be granted
to a woman during her widowhood, or to a man until he be
promoted to a benefice. In these and similar cases, when-
ever the contingency happens,—when the widow marries, or
when, the grantee obtains the benefice,—the respective es-
tates are absolutely determined and gone. Yet, while they
subsist, they are reckoned estates for life; because they
may by possibility last for life, if the contingencies upon
which they are to determine do not sooner happen. 2 Bl.
Comm. 121.
Freehold in law is a freehold which has descended to a
man, upon which he may enter at pleasure, but which he
has not entered on. Termes de la Ley.

joyment of all the civil and political rights ac-
corded to the people under a free government.
In the Roman law, it denoted one who was either born
free or emancipated, and was the opposite of "slave." In
feudal law, it designated an allodial proprietor, as dis-
tinguished from a vassal or feudal tenant. (And so in
Pennsylvania colonial law. Fry's Election Case, 71 Pa. 308,
10 Am.Rep. 698.) In old English law, the word described
a freeholder or tenant by free services; one who was not
a villein. In modern legal phraseology, it is the appella-
tion of a member of a city or borough having the right
of suffrage, or a member of any municipal corporation in-
vested with full civic rights.

## FREEMAN'S ROLL

A list of persons admitted
as burgesses or freemen for the purposes of the
rights reserved by the municipal corporation act,
(5 & 6 Wm. IV. c. 76.) Distinguished from the
Burgess Roll. 3 Steph.Comm. 197. The term was
used, in early colonial history, in some of the
American colonies.

## FREIGHT

Freight is properly the price or com-
pensation paid for the transportation of goods by
a carrier, at sea, from port to port. The Bill, D.
C.Md., 55 F.Supp. 780, 783. But the term is also
used to denote the hire paid for the carriage of
goods on land from place to place, (usually by a
railroad company, not an express company,) or
on inland streams or lakes. The name is also ap-
plied to the goods or merchandise transported by
any of the above means. Brittan v. Barnaby, 21
How. 533, 16 L.Ed. 177; Christie v. Davis Coal Co.,
D.C.N.Y., 95 F. 837, 838; Paradise v. Sun Mut. Ins.
Co., 6- La.Ann. 596.

5,424.
The reward, if any, to be paid for its carriage is called
"freightage ;" the person who delivers the freight to the
carrier is called the "consignor ;" and the person to whom
it is to be delivered is called the "consignee." Civil Code
Cal. § 2110; Comp.Laws N.D.1913, § 6197; Comp.Laws S.D.
1929, § 1119.
Property carried is called "freight." Lyman-
Richey Sand & Gravel Co. v. State, 123 Neb. 674,
243 N.W. 891, 893, 83 A.L.R. 1301.
"Dead freight" is money payable by a person who has
chartered a ship and only partly loaded her, in respect of
the loss of freight caused to the ship-owner by the de-
ficiency of cargo. L.R. 2 H.L. Sc. 128; The Rosemary, C.
C.A.Miss., 277 F. 674, 678.

able articles of every kind, character, and descrip-
tion, and a box car while so used is at least tem-
porarily a car carrying freight. State v. Jones,
84 W.Va. 85, 99 S.E. 271, 274.

## FRIVOLOUS

An answer is "frivolous" where it
appears from bare inspection to be lacking in
legal sufficiency, and, where in any view of the
facts pleaded, it does not present a defense. Nee-
fus v. Neefus, 209 Minn. 495, 296 N.W. 579, 581.
Any pleading is called "frivolous" when it is clear-
ly insufficient on its face, and does not contro-
vert the material points of the opposite pleading,
and is presumably interposed for mere purposes
of delay or to embarrass the opponent. Erwin
v. Lowery, 64 N.C. 321; Strong v. Sproul, 53 N.Y.
499; Gray v. Gidiere, 4 Strob., S.C., 442; In re
Beam, 93 N.J.Eq. 593, 117 A. 613, 614; Milberg v.
Keuthe, 98 N.J.L. 779, 121 A. 713, 714.
"Frivolous pleas" are those which are so clear.
ly and palpably bad as to require no argument
to convince the court thereof, and which would be
pronounced by the court indicative of bad faith
in the pleader on a mere inspection. U. S. V.
Delaney, D.C.N.J., 8 F.Supp. 224, 227.
A frivolous demurrer has been defined to be
one which is so clearly untenable, or its insuffi-
ciency so manifest upon a bare inspection of the
pleadings, that its character may be determined
without argument or research. Cottrill v. Cram-
er, 40 Wis. 558.
A "frivolous appeal" is one presenting no justi-
ciable question and so readily recognizable as de-
void of merit on face of record that there is little
prospect that it can ever succeed. Treat v. State
ex rel. Mitton, 121 Fla, 509, 163 So. 883.
A sham plea is good on its face, but false in fact; it
may, to all appearances, constitute a perfect defense, but
is a pretense because false and because not pleaded in good.
faith. A frivolous plea may be perfectly true in its allega-
tions, but yet is liable to be stricken out because totally
insufficient in substance. Andrew v. Bandler, Sup., 56 N.Y.
S. 614; Brown v. Jenison, 1 Code R.N.S., N.Y., 157;
Sheets v. Ramer, 125 Minn. 98, 145 N.W. 787. See, further,
Answer.
FRODMORTEL, or FREOMORTEL. An immun-
ity for committing manslaughter. Mon. Angl. t.
1, p. 173.

## FROM

Implies a starting point, whether it be
of time, place, or condition; and meaning: Hav-
ing a starting point of motion; noting the point
of departure, origin, withdrawal, etc.; out of,
starting at, as, he traveled "from" New York to
Chicago. Silva v. MacAuley, 135 Cal.App. 249, 26
P.2d 887. Word "from" or "after" an event or day
does not have an absolute and invariable mean-
ing, but each should receive an inclusion or ex-
clusion construction according to intention with
which such word is used. Acme Life Ins. Co. v.
White, Tex.Civ.App., 99 S.W.2d 1059, 1060. Words
"from" and "to," used in contract, may be given
meaning to which reason and sense entitles them,
under circumstances of case. Woodruff v. Adams,
134 Cal.App. 490, 25 P.2d 529.
As to whether the word was to be treated as inclusive or
exclusive of a terminus a quo, whether of time or place, a
critical writer formulated a rule that when referring to a
certain point as a terminus a quo, though in vulgar accepta-
tion it were capable of being taken indifferently, either
inclusively or exclusively, yet in law it has obtained a cer-
tain fixed import and is always taken as exclusive of the
terminus a quo. Powell, Powers 449. It generally ex-
cludes the day to which it relates, but the general rule
will yield to the intent of parties; Kendall v. Kingsley,
120 Mass. 94. The views of Lord Mansfield, in Cowp. 714
(overruling his own decision of three years before, id. 189),
was that it is either exclusive or inclusive according to
context and subject-matter, and the court will construe it
to effectuate the intent of parties and not to destroy it.
Lowman v. Shotkoski, 106 Neb. 540, 184 N.W. 107, 108;
Allen v. Effler, 144 Tenn. 685, 235 S.W. 67, 68; Martin v.
Travelers' Ins. Co., 310 Mo. 411, 276 S.W. 380, 382, 41 A.L.
R. 1372; Piatt v. Flaherty, 96 Kan. 42, 149 P. 734.
As to time, after an examination of authorities, Wash-
ington, J., laid down what he considered the settled prin-
ciples to be deduced from them : (1) When time is corn-
puted from an act done, the day of its performance is in-
cluded; (2) when the words are from the date, if a present
interest is to commence, the day is included, if it is a
terminus from which to impute time the day is excluded;
Pearpoint v. Graham, 4 Wash.C.C. 240, Fed.Cas.No.10,877;
where the latter principle was applied to a lease, as it was
90 in Lord Raym. 84; and to a bond; Lysle v. Williams,
15 S. & R., Pa., 135; and the first proposition has been laid
down with reference to the words "from and after the
passage of this act;" Arnold v. U. S., 9 Cra., U.S., 104, 3
L.Ed. 671; U. S. v. Williams, 1 Paine 261, Fed.Cas.No.
16,723; contra, Lorent v. Ins. Co., 1 Nott. & McC., S.C.,
505. See U. S. v. Heth, 3 Cra., U. S., 399, 2 L. Ed. 479.
From is generally held a word of exclusion ; Wilcox v.
Wood, 9 Wend., N.Y., 346; Ordway v. Remington, 12 R.I.
319, 34 Am.Rep. 646. But a promise made November 1st,
1811, and sued November 1st, 1817, was held barred by
statute of limitation; Presbrey v. Williams, 15 Mass. 193.
Where an act was to be done in a given number of days
from the time of the contract, the day on which the con-
tract was made was included; Brown v. Buzan, 24 Ind. 194;
but if the contract merely says in so may days it means so
many days from the day of date, and that is excluded ;
Blake v. Crowninshield, 9 N.H. 304. A fire policy from one
given date to another includes the last day; whether the
first is included was not decided; L.R. 5 Exch. 296. In
most cases when something is required to be done in a
given time from the day on which an event has happened,
that day is excluded, as in case of proving claims against
the estate of a decedent or insolvent; Weeks v. Hull, 19
Conn. 376, 50 Am.Dec. 249; enrolling deeds, after execu-
tion; Seawell v. Williams, 5 Hayw., Tenn., 283; appeal
from arbitrators, afterward; Browne v. Browne, 3 S. &
R., Pa., 496; issuing a scire facias to revive a judgment,
after entry; Appeal of Green, 6 W. & S., Pa., 327; the
time an execution runs, after its date; Homan v. Liswell,
6 Cow., N.Y., 659; redemption from execution sale; id.
518; allowing appeal from a justice; Ex parte Dean, 2
Cow., N.Y., 605, 14 Am.Dec. 521. The principle is thus
well expressed. When time is to be computed from a
particular day or a particular event, as when an act is to be
performed within a specified period from or after a day
named, that day is excluded and the last day included;
Sheets v. Selden, 2 Wall., U.S., 177, 17 L.Ed. 822. But it
was held that in considering the question of barring a writ
of error, the day of the decree is included; Chiles v.
Smith's Heirs, 13 B.Monr., Ky., 460. Six months from
testator's death allowed a legatee to give security not to
marry, are exclusive of that day; 15 Ves. 248.
Whenever they are used with respect to places it is said
that "from," "to," and "at" are taken inclusively accord-
ing to the subject-matter; Union Pac. R. Co. v. Hall, 91
U.S. 343, 23 L.Ed. 428 (fixing the terminus of a railroad
under an act of congress). From an object to an object in
a deed excludes the terminus referred to; Bonney v. Mor-
rill, 52 Me. 252; State v. Bushey, 84 Me. 459, 24 A. 940.
From place to place means from one place in a town to
another in the same town; Com. v. Inhabitants of Cam-
bridge, 7 Mass. 158; Com. v. Waters, 11 Gray, Mass., 81.
From a street means from any part of it according to cir-
cumstances; City of Pittsburg v. Cluley, 74 Pa. 259. From
a town is not always and indeed is seldom exclusive of the
place named; it generally means from some indefinite
place within the town; Chesapeake & 0. Canal Co. v.
Key, 3 Cra.C.C. 599, 606, Fed.Cas.No.2,649. Authority in a
railroad charter to construct a railroad from a city to
another point gives power to construct the road from any
point within the city; Hazlehurst v. Freeman, 52 Ga. 244;
contra North-Eastern R. Co. v. Payne, 8 Rich.L., S.C., 177.
But from a town to another in an indictment for transpor-
tation of liquor does not charge it as done within the town ;
State v. Bushey, 84 Me. 459, 24 A. 940. To construe rea-
sonably the expression a road from a village to a creek
within the same village, in a statute, requires that it be
taken inclusively; Smith v. Helmer, 7 Barb., N.Y., 416.
Sailing from a port means out of it; U. S. v. La Coste, 2
Mass. 129, Fed.Cas.No.15,548.
Descent from a parent cannot be construed to mean
through a parent, it must be immediate, from tithe person
347; but the words from the part of the father include a
descent, either immediately from the father or from any
person in the line of the father; Shippen v. Izard, 1 S. &
R., Pa., 222.
From the loading in a marine policy ordinarily means
that the risk is covered after the goods are on board, but
this meaning may be qualified by any words in the policy
indicating a different intention, 16 East 240; L.R. 7 Q.B.
580, 702.
From day to day, In reference to adjournments, usually
means to the next day but, under a statute authorizing the
adjournment of a sale from day to day, a sale is good if
made by adjournment to a day, certain, which did not
immediately succeed the first, Burns v. Lyon, 4 Watts, Pa.,
36.3. From henceforth in a lease means from the delivery;
5 Co. 1; so also does one from March 25th last past (the
execution being March 25th) ; 4 B. & C. 272; or one from
an impossible date (as February 30th), or no date, but if
it has a sensible date, the word date in other parts of it
means date, not delivery; 4 B. & C. 908.

## FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER

From prem-
ises owned by one person to premises owned by
another person in some legal subdivision or from
one legal subdivision to another. Liquor Trans-
portation Cases, 140 Tenn. 582, 205 S.W. 423, 426;
Ready v. State, 155 Tenn. 15, 290 S.W. 28, 29;
State v. White, 111 Kan. 196, 206 P. 903, 904.

## FROM PERSON

Includes taking from presence
of person assaulted as well as taking of property
in actual contact with person of one robbed. Peo-
ple v. Kubish, 357 Ill. 531, 192 N.E. 543, 545.

## FROM, THROUGH, OR UNDER

The term re-
fers to origin or devolution of property, and un-
less some title to or interest therein has been
derived by assignment or otherwise from party
adverse to decedent's estate, statute barring testi-
mony is inapplicable. In re Iwers' Estate, 225
Iowa 389, 280 N.W. 579, 582.

## FROM TIME TO TIME

Occasionally, at inter-
vals, now and then. Spade v. Hawkins, 60 Ind.
App. 388, 110 N.E. 1010, 1012. See From.

## FRONT

Forepart, as opposed to the back or
rear. State v. Read, 162 Iowa, 572; 144 N.W. 310,
311; Howland v. Andrus, 81 N.J.Eq. 175, 86 A. 391,
Any side or face of a building Is a front, although the
word is more commonly used to denote the entrance side.
In re McInerney, 47 Wyo. 258, 34 P.2d 35, 43. As applied
to a bare lot, it Is that side of lot towards which, in ordi-
nary circumstances, house, when built, will most likely
face, and very general usage of building houses with their
main entrance toward shorter street line results in common
understanding that this is side intended when front of lot
is referred to. Rhinehart v. Leitch, 107 Conn. 400, 140 A.

## FRONT FOOT

As respects assessment, synony-
mous with "abutting foot." Moberly v. Hogan,
131 Mo. 19, 32 S.W. 1014.
The rate of assessment is obtained by having the total

thus substituted for the pre-existing debts is called the
"funded debt." Ketchum v. Buffalo, 14 N.Y. 356; Lawrey
v. Sterling, 41 Or. 518, 69 P. 460. This term is very seldom

claims. State v. Finney, 141 Kan. 12, 40 P.2d 411,
In its narrower and more usual sense, "fund" signifies
"capital," as opposed to "interest" or "income;" as where
we speak of a corporation funding the arrears of interest
due on its bonds, or the like, meaning that the interest is
capitalized and made to bear interest in its turn until it is
repaid. Sweet.

er Co., 193 N.C. 780, 138 S.E. 131, 134, 53 A.L.R.
Those things one specimen of which is as good as
another, as is the case with half-crowns, or pounds of rice
of the same quality. Horses, slaves, and so forth, are non-
fungible things, because they differ individually in value,
and cannot be exchanged indifferently one for another.
Holl.Jur. 88.
Where a thing which is the subject of an obligation
(which one man is bound to deliver to another) must be
delivered in specie, the thing is not fungible; that very
individual thing, and not another thing of the same or
another class, in lieu of it, must be delivered. Where the
subject of the obligation is a thing of a given class, the
thing is said to be fungible; i. e., the delivery of any
object which answers to the generic description will satisfy
the terms of the obligation. Aust.Jur. 483, 484.
