## HABEAS CORPORA JURATORUM

A writ com-
manding the sheriff to bring up the persons of
jurors, and, if need were, to distrain them of their
lands and goods, in order to insure or compel their
attendance in court on the day of trial of a cause.
It issued from the Common Pleas, and served the
same purpose as a distringas juratores in the
King's Bench. It was abolished by the C. L. P.
Act, 1852, § 104. Brown.

## HABEAS CORPUS

Lat. (You have the body.)
The name given to a variety of writs, (of which
these were anciently the emphatic words,) hav-
ing for their object to bring a party before a court
or judge. In common usage, and whenever these
words are used alone, they are understood to mean
the habeas corpus ad sub jiciendum, (see infra.)
Dancy v. Owens, 126 Okl. 37, 258 P. 879, 884; In re
McDevitt, 101 Misc. 588, 168 N.Y.S. 433; U. S. v.

The sole function of the writ is to release from unlaw-
ful imprisonment. People ex rel. Luciano v. Murphy, 160
Misc. 573, 290 N.Y.S. 1011. The office of the writ is not to
determine prisoner's guilt or innocence, and only issue
which it presents is whether prisoner is restrained of his
liberty by due process. Ex parte Presnell, 58 Okl.Cr. 50,
49 P.2d 232.

## HABEAS CORPUS ACT

The English statute of
31 Car. II. c. 2, is the original and prominent ha-
beas corpus act. It was amended and supplement-
ed by St. 56 Geo. III. c. 100. And similar statutes
have been enacted in all the United States. This
act is justly regarded as the great constitutional
guaranty of personal liberty.

legal confinement, called by Sir William Blackstone the
most celebrated writ in the English law, and the great and
efficacious writ in all manner of illegal confinement. 3 Bl.

(q. V.) 1 Tidd, Pr. 348, 349.

## HABEMUS OPTIMUM TESTEM, CONFITENT- EM REUM

1 Phil. Ev. 397. We have the best
witness,—a confessing defendant. "What is tak-
en pro confess° is taken as indubitable truth. The
plea of guilty by the party accused shuts out all
further inquiry. Habemus con fitentem reum is
demonstration, unless indirect motives can be as-
signed to it?' 2 Hagg. Eccl. 315.

## HABENDUM

clause usually following the granting part of the
premises of a deed, which defines the extent of
the ownership in the thing granted to be held and
enjoyed by the grantee. 3 Washb. Real Prop. 437;
New York Indians v. U. S., 170 U.S. 1, 18 S.Ct. 531,
42 L.Ed. 927; Freudenberger Oil Co. v. Simmons,
75 W.Va. 337, 83 S.E. 995, 997, Ann.Cas.1918A,
873; In re Tamargo, 220 N.Y. 225, 115 N.E. 462,
The office of the "habendum" is properly to determine
what estate or interest is granted by the deed, though of-
fice may be performed by the premises, in which case the
habendum may lessen, enlarge, explain, or qualify, but
not totally contradict or be repugnant to, estate granted
in the premises. Claridge v. Phelps, Ind.App., 105 Ind.
App. 344, 11 N.E.2d 503, 504.

HABERE FACIAS SEISINAM. L. Lat. That you
cause to have seisin. The writ of execution in
real actions, directing the sheriff to cause the de-
mandant to have seisin of the lands recovered. It
was the proper process for giving seisin of a free-

lands.

## HABERE FACIAS VISUM

Lat. That you cause
to have a view. A writ to cause the sheriff to take
a view of lands or tenements.

## HABERE LICERE

Lat. In Roman law, to al-
low [one] to have [possession.] This phrase de-

to a general understanding and belief of some-
thing's having happened: thus, by the law of Scot-
land, marriage may be established by "habit and
repute" where the parties cohabit and are at the
same time held and reputed as man and wife.
See Bell. The same rule obtains in some of the
United States.

## HABITABLE REPAIR

A covenant by a lessee
to "put the premises into habitable repair" binds
him to put them into such a state that they may
be occupied, not only with safety, but with rea-
sonable comfort, for the purposes for which they
are taken. Miller v. McCardell, 19 R.I. 304, 33 A.
445, 30 L.R.A. 682; 2 Mood. & R. 186.

## HABITANCY

That fixed place of abode to which
a person intends to return habitually when absent.
Settled dwelling in a given place; fixed and 'per-
manent residence there.
This term is more comprehensive than "domicile," for
one may be domiciled in a given place though he does not
spend the greater portion of his time there, or though he
may be absent for long periods. It is also more compre-
hensive than "residence," for one may reside in a given
place only temporarily or for short periods on the occasion
of repeated visits. But in neither case could he properly be
called an "inhabitant" of that place or be said to have his
"habitancy" there. Atkinson v. Washington & Jefferson
College, 54 W.Va. 32, 46 S.E. 253; Hairston v. Hairston,
27 Miss. 711, 61 Am.Dec. 530; Abington v. North Bridge-
water, 23 Pick., Mass., 170. And see Domicile; Residence.
It is difficult to give an exact definition of "habitancy."
In general terms, one may be designated as an "inhabit-
ant" of that place which constitutes the principal seat of
his residence, of his business, pursuits, connections, at-
tachments, and of his political and municipal relations.
The term, therefore, embraces the fact of residence at a
place, together with the intent to regard it and make it a
home. The act and intent must concur. Lyman v. Fiske,
17 Pick., Mass., 231, 28 Am.Dec. 293.

## HABITANT

Fr. In French and Canadian law,
a resident tenant; a settler; a tenant who kept
hearth and home on the seigniory. A native of
Canada of French descent, particularly of the
peasant or farming class.

## HABITATIO

Lat. In the civil law, the right of
dwelling; the right of free residence in another's
house. Inst. 2, 5; Dig. 7, 8.
HABITATION.
In the civil law. The right of a person to
live in the house of another without preju-
dice to the property. It differed from a usu-
fruct, in this: that the usufructuary might apply
the house to any purpose, as of a store or manu-
factory; whereas the party having the right of
habitation could only use it for the residence of
himself and family. 1 Browne, Civil Law, 184.
In Estates. A dwelling-house; a homestall. 2
Bl.Comm. 4; 4 Bl.Comm. 220; Holmes v. Oregon
& C. R. Co., D.C.Or., 5 F. 527; Nowlin v. Scott, 10
Grat., Va., 65; Harvard College v. Gore, 5 Pick.,
Mass., 372.
In its generic sense, the term denotes a place of abode,
but as used in a restrictive building covenant it may be
synonymous simply with "dwelling." Goodhue v. Fennell,
164 App.Div. 821, 150 N.Y.S. 435, 436.

## HABITUAL

Customary, usual, of the nature of
a habit; its synonyms are customary, common,
regular; while its antonyms are unusual, unwont-
ed, extraordinary, rare. Illinois Bankers Life
Ass'n v. Theodore, 47 Ariz. 314, 55 P.2d 806, 811.
Formed or acquired by or resulting from hab-
it; frequent use or custom. Moore v. State, 111
Tex.Cr.R. 461, 14 S.W.2d 1041. The "habitual" in-
dulgence in violent and ungovernable temper as
a ground for divorce is not synonymous with "fre-
quent." Kellogg v. Kellogg, 93 Fla. 261, 111 So.
637, 638.

## HABITUAL CRIMINAL

By statute in several
states, one who is convicted of a felony, having
been previously convicted of any crime (or twice
so convicted), or who is convicted of a misdemean-
or and has previously (in New York) been five
N.Y. § 510; Rev.St.Utah, 1898, § 4067 (Comp.Laws
1917, § 7907). In a more general sense, one made
subject to police surveillance and arrest on sus-
picion, on account of his previous criminal record
and absence of honest employment.

## HABITUAL CRIMINALS ACT

The statute 32 &
33 Vict. c. 99. By this act power was given to ap-
prehend on suspicion convicted persons holding
license under the penal servitude acts, 1853, 1857,
and 1864. The act was repealed and replaced by
the prevention of crimes act, 1871, (34 & 35 Vict.
c. 112.)

## HABITUAL DRUNKARD

One who has a fixed
habit of frequently getting drunk, though not
oftener drunk than sober, and though sober for
weeks at a time. Patton v. Commonwealth, 273
Ky. 307, 116 S.W.2d 652, 653.
One who frequently and repeatedly becomes intoxicated
by excessive indulgence in intoxicating liquor so as to
acquire a fixed habit and an involuntary tendency to be-
come intoxicated as often as the temptation is presented,
even though he remains sober for days or even weeks at a
time. Leonard v. Leonard, 221 Iowa 722, 266 N.W. 537,
A person given to inebriety or the excessive use of in-
toxicating drink, who has lost the power or the will, by
frequent indulgence, to control his appetite for it. Lud-
wick v. Com., 18 Pa. 174; Gourlay v. Gourlay, 16 R.I. 705,
19 A. 142; McBee v. McBee, 22 Or. 329, 29 P. 887, 29 Am.St.
Rep. 613.
It is not necessary that the person shall have lost his will
power so that he cannot resist stimulants, Lester v.
Sampson, Mo.App., 180 S.W. 419, 421; or that he be in-
toxicated so often as to incapacitate him from attending
to his business for a considerable portion of time. Runkle
v. Southern Pac. Milling Co., 184 Cal. 714, 195 P. 398, 400,
16 A.L.R. 275.
In England, defined by the habitual drunkards act, 1879,
(42 & 43 Vict. c. 19,) which authorizes confinement in a
retreat, upon the party's own application, as "a person
who, not being amenable to any jurisdiction in lunacy, is,
notwithstanding, by reason of habitual intemperate drink-
ing of intoxicating liquor, at times dangerous to himself,
or herself, or others, or incapable of managing himself or
herself, or his or her affairs."
HABITUAL DRUNKENNESS, INTOXICATION,
or INTEMPERANCE. The custom or habit of
getting drunk; the constant indulgence in stim-
ulants, whereby intoxication is produced; not the
ordinary use, but the habitual use of them; the
habit should be actual and confirmed, but need
not be continuous, or even of daily occurrence.
Williams v. Goss, 43 La.Ann. 868, 9 So. 750; Short
v. Morrison, 159 La. 193, 105 So. 286, 288. As a
cause for divorce, the fixed habit of frequently
getting drunk; it does not necessarily imply con-
tinual drunkenness. Moor v. Moor, 211 Ala. 56, 99
So. 316, 318; Holm v. Holm, 44 Utah, 242, 139 P.
937, 938. That degree of intemperance from the
use of intoxicating drinks which disqualifies the
person a great portion of the time from properly
attending to business, or which would reasonably
inflict a course of great mental anguish upon the
innocent party. Rev.Codes Idaho, § 2652 (Code
1932, § 31-608). It has no reference to the exces-
sive or habitual use of drugs. Hayes v. Hayes, 86
Fla. 350, 98 So. 66, 67; Smith v. Smith, 7 Boyce,
Del., 283, 105 A. 833.

## HABITUALLY

tice or use. It does not mean entirely or exclusive-
ly. Stanton v. French, 91 Cal. 274, 27 P. 657, 25

The children or descendants of the deceased.

## HIEREDES REMOTIORES

The kinsmen other than children or descendants.
HiEREDES SUI ET NECESSARII. In Roman
law, own and necessary heirs; e., the lineal de-
scendants of the estate-leaver. They were called
"necessary" heirs, because it was the law that
made them heirs, and not the choice of either the
decedent or themselves. But since this was also
true of slaves (when named "heirs" in the will)
the former class were designated "sui et neces-
sarii," by way of distinction, the word "sui" de-
noting that the necessity arose from their relation-
ship to the decedent. Mackeld. Rom. Law, § 733.

## HLEREDIPETA

Lat. In old English law, a seek-
er of an inheritance; hence, the next heir to lands.
Du Cange.
H1EREDIPETZE SUO PROPINQUO VEL EX-
TRANEO PERICULOSO SANE CUSTODI NUL-
LUS COMMITTATUR. To the next heir, whether
a relation or a stranger certainly a dangerous
guardian, let no one be committed. Co. Litt. 88b.
HZEREDITAS.
In Roman law. The hcereditas was a universal
succession by law to any deceased person, whether
such person had died testate or intestate, and
whether in trust (ex fideicommisso) for another
or not. The like succession according to
torian law was bonorum possessio.
The hcereditas was called "jacens," until the hceres took
it up, i. e., made his aditio hcereditatis; and such hceres,
if a suus hceres, had the right to abstain, (potestas ab-
stinendi,) and, if an extraneus hceres, had the right to con-
sider whether he would accept or decline, (potestas deliber-
andi,) the reason for this precaution being that (prior to
Justinian's enactment to the contrary) a hceres after his
aditio was liable to the full extent of the debts of the de-
ceased person, and could have no relief therefrom, except
in the case of a damnum emergens or damnosa hcereditas,
i. e., an hcereditus which disclosed (after the aditio) some
enormous unsuspected liability. Brown. The theory was
that, though the physical person of the deceased had
perished, his legal personality survived and descended
unimpaired on his heirs in whom his legal identity was
continued.
In Old English Law. An estate transmissible
by descent; an inheritance. Co. Litt. 9.
HIEREDITAS, ALIA CORPORALIS, ALIA IN-
CORPORALIS; CORPORALIS EST, QU1E TANGI
POTEST ET VIDERI; INCORPORALIS QUZE
TANGI NON POTEST NEC VIDERI. Co. Litt. 9.
An inheritance is either corporeal or incorporeal.
Corporeal is that which can be touched and seen;
incorporeal, that which can neither be touched
nor seen.

## HIEREDITAS DAMNOSA

A burdensome inherit-
ance; one which would be a burden instead of a
benefit, that is, the debts to be paid by the heir
would exceed the assets.

## HIEREDITAS EST SUCCESSIO IN UNIVERSUM JUS QUOD DEFUNCTUS HABUERIT

Co. Litt.
237. Inheritance is the succession to every right
which the deceased had.

## HIEREDITAS JACENS

In civil law, a prostrate
or vacant inheritance. The inheritance left to a
voluntary heir was so called so long as he had not
manifested, either expressly or by silence, his ac-
ceptance or refusal of the inheritance. So long as
no one had acquired the inheritance, it was termed
"hcereditas jacens;" and this, by a legal fiction,
represented the person of the decedent. Mackeld.
Rom. Law, § 737. The estate of a person deceased,
where the owner left no heirs or legatee to take
it, called also "caduca;" an escheated estate. Cod.
10, 10, 1; 4 Kent, Comm. 425. The term has also
been used in English law to signify an estate in
abeyance; that is, after the ancestor's death, and
before assumption of heir. Co. Litt. 342b. An in-
heritance without legal owner, and therefore open
to the first occupant. 2 Bl.Comm. 259.

## HIEREDITAS LEGITIMA

A succession or in-
heritance devolving by operation of law (intestate
succession) rather than by the will of the dece-
dent. Mackeld. Rom. Law, § 654.

## HIEREDITAS LUCTUOSA

A sad or mournful in-
heritance or succession; as that of a parent to
the estate of a child, which was regarded as dis-
turbing the natural order of mortality (turbato
ordine mortalitatis.) Cod. 6, 25, 9; 4 Kent, Comm.
397. It was sometimes termed tristis successio.
HIEREDITAS NIHIL ALIUD EST, QUAM SUC-
CESSIO IN UNIVERSUM JUS, QUOD DEFUNC-
TUS HABUERIT. The right of inheritance is
nothing else than the faculty of succeeding to all
the rights of the deceased. Dig. 50, 17, 62.

## HIEREDITAS NUNQUAM ASCENDIT

An in-
heritance never ascends. Glanv. lib. 7, c. 1; 2 Bl.

## HIEREDITAS TESTAMENTARIA

Testamen-
tary inheritance, that is, succession to an estate
under and according to the last will and testament

## HIEREDUM APPELLATIONE VENIUNT WERE- DES HAEREDUM IN INFINITUM

By the title
of heirs, come the heirs of heirs to infinity. Co.
Litt. 9.
ILERES.
In Roman Law. The heir, or universal succes-
sor in the event of death. The heir is he who
actively or passively succeeds to the entire prop-
erty of the estate-leaver. He is not only the suc-
cessor to the rights and claims, but also to the
estate-leaver's debts, and in relation to his estate
is to be regarded as the identical person of the
estate-leaver, inasmuch as he represents him in all
his active and passive relations to his estate. Mac-
keld. Rom. Law, § 651.
The institution of the hceres was the essential character-
istic of a testament: if this was not done, the instrument
was called a codicillus. Mack.C.L. §§ 632, 650.
It should be remarked that the office, powers, and duties
of the hceres, in Roman law, were much more closely as-
similated to those of a modern executor than to those of an
heir at law. Hence "heir" is not at all an accurate trans-
lation of "hceres," unless it be understood in a special,
technical sense.
In Common Law. An heir; he to whom lands,
tenements, or hereditaments by the act of God
and right of blood to descend, of some estate of
inheritance. Co. Litt. 7b.

recognized in the English law. Wms. R. P., 6th
Am. ed. 96.

## HARES NECESSARIUS

In the civil law, a nec-
essary or compulsory heir. This name was given
to the heir when, being a slave, he was named
"heir" in the testament, because on the death of
the testator, whether he would or not, he at once
became free, and was compelled to assume the
heirship. Inst. 2, 19, 1.

The object of the establishment was to facilitate the im-
mediate recourse to arbitration for the settlement of inter-
national differences by providing a permanent court, "ac-
cessible at all times, and acting, in default of agreement to
the contrary between the parties, in accordance with the
rules of procedure inserted in the present convention."
The court is given jurisdiction over all arbitration cases,
provided the parties do not agree to institute a special
tribunal. An international Bureau was likewise established
to serve as a registry for the court and to be the channel of
communications relative to the meetings of the court. The
court, although called "permanent," is really so only in the
fact that there is a permanent list of members from among
whom the arbitrators in a given case are selected. At the
Second Hague Conference of 1907, apart from minor
changes made in the court, it was provided that, of the
two arbitrators appointed by each of the parties, only one
should be a national of the appointing state. 1 Scott, 274-

tered. Crabb, Eng. Law, 26.
It was sometimes used to designate a convention of
citizens in their public hall and was also called folkmote
and halimote. The word halimote rather signifies the
lord's court or a court baron held in a manor in which the
differences between the tenants were determined. Cunn.
L.Dict.; Cowell.
"Furthermore, it seems to have been a common practice
for a wealthy abbey to keep a court, known as a halimote,
on each of its manors, while in addition to these manorial
courts it kept a central court, a libera curia for all its
greater freehold tenants. And we may now and again
meet with courts which are distinctly called courts of hon-
ors. The rule then was not merely this, that the lord of
a manor may hold a court for the manor; but rather this,
that a lord may hold a court for his tenants." 1 Poll. &

other sound when nothing strikes his ear. See

Cooper, C.C.Mich., 13 F. 590; People v. Krist, 168
N.Y. 19, 60 N.E. 1057.
An error, a blunder, a mistake, a fallacy; and

sanity. Foster's Ex'rs v. Dickerson, 64 Vt. 233, 24
A. 253.

has no existence. The conscious recognition of a sensation
of sight, hearing, feeling, taste, or smell which is not due

18. An insult offered in one's own house (insultus

till half dead and then cut down; his entrails cut
out and burnt; his head cut off and his body to be
divided into quarters, which, with his head, were

a code of maritime law, which was known as the
"Laws of the Hanse Towns," or Jus Hanseaticum
Maritimum.
The years 1356 to 1377 marked the zenith
of the league's power. The league gradually

were left alone to preserve the name and small

"Port" is a word of larger import than "harbor," since
it implies the presence of wharves, or at any rate the means
and opportunity of receiving and discharging cargo. See
7 M. & G. 870; Martin v. Hilton, 9 Metc., Mass., 371; 2
B. & Ald. 460. Thus, we have the "said harbor, basin,

improperly. Poll.Torts 275; Wood v. Gale, 10
N.H. 247, 34 Am.Dec. 150; Eells v. People, 4 Scam.,
Ill., 498. It may be aptly used to describe the fur-
nishing of shelter, lodging, or food clandestinely or
with concealment, and under certain circum-
stances, may be equally applicable to those acts
divested of any accompanying secrecy. U. S. v.
Grant, C.C.Or., 55 F. 415.
As used in U. S. Criminal Code, § 42, 18 U.S.C.A. § 1381,
the word "harbor" means to lodge, to care for, after
secreting the deserter. Firpo v. U. S., C.C.A.N.Y., 261 F.
850, 853.
To "harbor" a dog involves the idea of protection, and
of treating it as living at one's house, and undertaking to
control its actions. Hagenau v. Millard, 182 Wis. 544, 195

## HARD CASES

A , phrase used to indicate deci-
sions which, to meet a case of hardship to a party,
are not entirely consonant with the true principle
of the law. It is said of such: Hard cases make
bad law. Hard cases must not make bad equity
any more than bad law; Moore v. Pierson, 6
Iowa 279, 71 Am.Dec. 409. Hard cases are the
quicksands of the law. Metropolitan Nat. Bank of
Kansas City, Mo. v. Campbell Commission Co.,

ject matter of controversy. Bates v. Dana, 345

meaning. construed in one statute as having been employed
in a narrow, restricted sense, and in another to have been

v. Smith, 96 Md. 393, 54 A. 102. Sewall v. Roberts, 115
Mass. 268. He who is born or begotten in lawful wedlock,
and upon whom the law casts the inheritance immediately
upon the death of his ancestor. Moffett v. Conley, 63 Okl.
3, 163 P. 118, 120.
One who would receive his estate under statute
of descent and distribution. Faulkner's Guardian
v. Faulkner, 237 Ky. 147, 35 S.W.2d 6, 7.
Moreover, the term is frequently used in a pop-
ular sense to designate a successor to property
either bly will or by law. Wallace v. Privett, 198
According to many authorities, heir may be
nomen collectivum, as well in a deed as in a will,
and operate in both in the same manner as the
word heirs. 1 Rolle, Abr. 253; Ambl. 453; Cro.
Eliz. 313; 1 Burr. 38. But see 2 Prest.Est. 9, 10.
The word must be construed according to tes-
tator's intention as gathered from whole will.
Fadler v. Gabbert, 333 Mo. 851, 63 S.W.2d 121.
See, also, Heirs.
In the civil law. A universal successor in the
event of death. He who actively or passively suc-
ceeds to the entire property or estate, rights and
obligations, of a decedent, and occupies his place.
The term is indiscriminately applied to all persons who
are called to the succession, whether by the act of the party
or by operation of law. The person who is created uni-
versal successor by a will is called the "testamentary
heir ;" and the next of kin by blood is, in cases of intes-
tacy, called the "heir at law," or "heir by intestacy." The
executor of the common law in many respects corresponds
to the testamentary heir of the civil law. Again, the
administrator in many respects corresponds with the heir
by intestacy. By the common law, executors and adminis-
trators have no right except to the personal estate of the
deceased ; whereas the heir by the civil law is authorized
to administer both the personal and real estate. Story,
Confl. Laws, §§ 57, 508; 1 Brown, Civ. Law, 344.
The term "heir" has several significations. Sometimes it
refers to one who has formally accepted a succession and
taken possession thereof ; sometimes to one who is called
to succeed, but still retains the faculty of accepting or
renouncing, and it is frequently used as applied to one who
has formally renounced. Mumford v. Bowman, 26 La.Ann.
In Scotch law. The person who succeeds to the
heritage or heritable rights of one deceased. 1
Forb.Inst. pt. 3, p. 75. The word has a more ex-
tended signification than in English law, compre-
hending not only those who succeed to lands, but
successors to personal property also. Wharton.
Right heir. This term was formerly used, in
the case of estates tail, to distinguish the prefer-
red heir, to whom the estate was limited, from
the heirs in general, to whom, on the failure of
the preferred heir and his line, the remainder over
was usually finally limited. With the abolition of
estates tail, the term has fallen into desuetude,.
but when still used, in modern law, it has no oth-
er meaning than "heir at law." Brown v. Wads-
worth, 168 N.Y. 225, 61 N.E. 250.

## HEIR APPARENT

An heir whose right of in-
heritance is indefeasible, provided he outlive the
ancestor; as in England the eldest son, or his is-
sue, who must, by the course of the common law,
be heir to the father whenever he happens to die._
2 Bl.Comm. 208; 1 Steph.Comm. 358; Jones v.
Fleming, 37 Hun. (N.Y.) 230. One who, before
the death of the ancestor, is next in the line of
succession, provided he be heir to the ancestor
whenever he happens to die. Reese v. Stires, 87
N.J.Eq. 32, 103 A. 679. See, also, Apparent Heir.

## HEIR AT LAW

He who, after his ancestor dies
intestate, has a right to all lands, tenements, and
hereditaments which belonged to him or of which
he was seised. The same as "heir general." For-
rest v. Porch, 100 Tenn. 391, 45 S.W. 676.
The heir at common law is that person who succeeds to
the real estate in case of intestacy.. Walker v. Walker, 283
111. 11, 118 N.E. 1014, 1019. In its strict sense and technical
import, the person or persons appointed by law to succeed
to the estate in case of intestacy. Albright v. Albright, 116
Ohio St. 668, 157 N.E. 760, 762. In a comprehensive and
popular sense, one who inherits either real or personal
property: Gross v. Hartford-Connecticut Trust Co., 100
Conn. 332, 123 A. 907, 908. Next of kin, Meeker v. Forbes,
84 N.J.Eq. 271, 93 A. 887, 888.
In the term "heir at law," as used in will, suffix "at law"
adds merely expectant feature of one's statutory position
toward an ancestor or source of title who is considered as
still living, whereas word "heir" alone denotes that ances-
tor has already died. In re Ward's Estate, 297 N.Y.S. 16,
19, 162 Misc. 855.
A deceased person's "heirs at law" are those who succeed
to his estate of inheritance under statutes of descent and
distribution, in absence of testamentary disposition, and
not necessarily his_heirs at common law, who are persons
.succeeding to deceased's realty in case of his intestacy. In
re Towndrow's Will, 47 N.M. 173, 138 P.2d 1001, 1003.
HEIRS AT LAW SHALL NOT BE DISINHERIT-
ED BY CONJECTURE, BUT ONLY BY EXPRESS
WORDS OR NECESSARY IMPLICATION.
.Schoul. Wills § 479.

## HEIR BENEFICIARY

In the civil law, one who
has accepted the succession under the benefit of
an inventory regularly made.
Heirs are divided into two classes, according to the man-
ner in which they accept the successions left to them,
to-wit, unconditional and beneficiary heirs. Unconditional
heirs are those who inherit without any reservation, or
without making an inventory, whether their acceptance be
express or tacit. Beneficiary heirs are those who have
accepted the succession under the benefit of an inventory
regularly made. Civ.Code La. art. 883. If the heir appre-
hend that the succession will be burdened with debts
beyond its value, he accepts with benefit of inventory, and
in that case he is respopsible only for the value of the suc-
cession.

## HEIR BY ADOPTION

An adopted child, "who is
in a limited sense made an heir, not by the law,
but by the contract evidenced by the deed of adop-
tion." In re Sessions' Estate, 70 Mich.. 297, 38 N.
W. 249, 14 Am.St.Rep. 500.

## HEIR BY CUSTOM

In English law, one whose
right of inheritance depends upon a particular and
local custom, such as gavelkind, or borough Eng-
lish. Co.Litt. 140.

## HEIR BY DEVISE

One to whom lands are de-
vised by will; a devisee of lands. Answering to
the hceres factus (q. v.) of the civil law.

## HEIR COLLATERAL

One who is not lineally
related to the decedent, but is of collateral kin;
e. g., his uncle, cousin, brother, nephew.

## HEIR CONVENTIONAL

In the civil law, one
who takes a succession by virtue of a contract or
settlement entitling him thereto.

## HEIR EXPECTANT

One whose parents were
living, as respects lots to which parents had title.
Adams v. Adams, 348 Mo. 1041, 156 S.W.2d 610, 616.

## HEIR, FORCED

One who cannot be disinherit-
ed. See Forced Heirs.

## HEIR GENERAL

An heir at law. The ordinary
heir by blood, succeeding to all the lands. For-
HEIR INSTITUTE. In Scotch law, one to whom
the right of succession is ascertained by disposi-
tion or express deed of the deceased. 1 Forb.Inst.
pt. 3, p. 75.

## HEIR, IRREGULAR

In Louisiana, irregular
heirs are those who are neither testamentary nor
legal, and who have been established by law to
take the succession. See Civ.Code La. art. 878.
When there are no direct or collateral relatives
surviving the decedent, and the succession conse-
quently devolves upon the surviving husband or
wife, or illegitimate children, or the state, it is
called an "irregular succession."
HEIR, LEGAL. In the civil law, a legal heir is
one who takes the succession by relationship to
the decedent and by force of law.
This is different from a testamentary or conventional
heir, who takes the succession in virtue of the disposition
of man. See Civ.Code La. arts. 877, 879. The term is also
used in Anglo-American law in substantially the same
sense, that is, the person to whom the law would give the
decedent's property, real and personal, if he should die
intestate. Waller v. Martin, 106 Tenn. 341, 61 S.W. 73, 82
Am.St.Rep. 882. In legal strictness, the term signifies one
who would inherit real estate, but it is also used to indi-
cate one who would take under the statute of distribution.
Morse v. Ward, 92 Conn. 408, 103 A. 119, 120.

## HEIR, MALE

In Scotch law, an heir institute,
who, though not next in blood to the deceased, is
his nearest male relation that can succeed to him.
1 Forb.Inst. pt. 3, p. 76. In English law, the near-
est male blood-relation of the decedent, unless
further limited by the words "of his body," which
restrict the inheritance to sons, grandsons, and
other male descendants in the right line. Jordan
v. Adams, 6 C.B.,N.S., 764; Goodtitle v. Herring,
1 East, 275; Ewan v. Cox, 9 N.J.Law, 14.

## HEIR OF CONQUEST

In Scotch law, one who
succeeds to the deceased in conquest, i. e., lands
or other heritable rights to which the deceased
neither did nor could succeed as heir to his pre-
decessor.

## HEIR OF LINE

In Scotch law, one who succeeds
lineally by right of blood; one who succeeds to
the deceased in his heritage; e., lands and other
heritable rights derived to him by succession as
heir to his predecessor. 1 Forb.Inst. pt. 3, p. 77.

## HEIR OF PROVISION

In Scotch law, one who
succeeds as heir by virtue of a particular provi-
sion in a deed or instrument.

## HEIR OF TAILZIE

In Scotch law, he on whom
an estate is settled that would not have fallen to
him by legal succession. 1 Forb.Inst. pt. 3, p. 75.

## HEIR OF THE BLOOD

An inheritor who suc-
ceeds to the estate by virtue of consanguinity with
the decedent, either in the ascending or descend..
ing line, including illegitimate children, but ex-
cluding husbands, wives, and adopted children.
Hayden v. Barrett, 172 Mass. 472, 52 N.E. 530, 70
Am.St.Rep. 295.

## HEIR OF THE BODY

An heir begotten or borne
by the person referred to, or a child of such heir;
a surviving husband or wife, adopted children,
and collateral relations; bodily heir. Ratliffe v.
Ratliffe, 182 Ky. 230, 206 S.W. 478, 479. Clarkson
v. Hatton, 143 Mo. 47, 44 S.W. 761, 39 L.R.A. 748,
65 Am.St.Rep. 635.
May be used in either of two senses : In their unrestrict-
ed sense, as meaning the persons who from generation to
generation become entitled by descent under the entail;
and in the sense of heirs at law, or those persons who are
descendants of him whom the statute of descent appoints
to take intestate estate. Bunn v. Butler, 300 Ill. 269, 133
N.E. 246, 247. Unless the will discloses an intention to the
contrary, the term "heirs of the body" is not synonymous
with children. Clark v. Cammack, 216 Ala. 346, 113 So. 270,
271. And ordinarily, such words are words of limitation
and not of purchase. Kirby v. Hulette, 174 Ky. 257, 192
S. W. 63, 65; contra: Owen v. Trail, 302 Mo. 292, 258 S. W.
699, 701. The words are sometimes deemed equivalent to
"issue" or "descendants" ; Rhode Island Hospital Trust
Co. v. Bridgham, 42 R.I. 161, 106 A. 149, 152, 5 A.L.R. 185;
and sometimes not; In re English's Estate, 270 Pa. 1, 112
A. 913, 914.

## HEIR PRESUMPTIVE

The person who, if the
ancestor should die immediately, would, in the
present circumstances of things, be his heir, but
whose right of inheritance may be defeated by
the contingency of some nearer heir being born;
as a brother or nephew, whose presumptive suc-
cession may be destroyed by the birth of 'a child.
2 Bl.Comm. 208; 1 Steph.Comm. 358; Jones v.
Fleming, 37 Hun., N.Y., 230.
In Louisiana, the presumptive heir Is he who Is the near-
est relation of the deceased capable of inheriting. This
quality is given to him before the decease of the person
from whom he is to inherit, as well as after the opening of
the succession, until he has accepted or renounced it. La.
Civ.Code, art. 880.

## HEIR SPECIAL

In English law, the issue in
tail, who claims per formam Boni; by the form
of the gift.

## HEIR SUBSTITUTE, IN A BOND

In Scotch law,
he to whom a bond is payable expressly in case
of the creditor's decease, or after his death. 1
Forb.Inst. pt. 3, p. 76.

## HEIR TESTAMENTARY

In the civil law, one
who is named and appointed heir in the testament
of the decedent. This name distinguishes him
from a legal heir, (one upon whom the law casts
the succession,) and from a conventional heir,
(one who takes it by virtue of a previous contract
or settlement.)
HEIR UNCONDITIONAL. In the civil law and in
Louisiana, one who inherits without any reserva-
tion, or without making an inventory, whether his
acceptance be express or tacit. Distinguished
from heir beneficiary. La.Civ.Code, art. 882.

## HEIRDOM

Succession by inheritance.

## HEIRESS

A female heir to a person having an
estate of inheritance. When there are more than
one, they are called "co-heiresses," or "co-heirs."
HEIRLOOMS. Such goods and chattels as, con-
trary to the nature of chattels, shall go by special
custom to the heir along with the inheritance, and
not to the executor. The termination "loom"
(Sax.) signifies a limb or member; so that an
the inheritance. They are generally such things
as cannot be taken away without damaging or dis-
membering the freehold; such as deer in a park,
doves in a cote, deeds and charters, etc. 2 Bl.
Comm. 427.
This word seems to be compounded of heir, and loom,
that is, a frame, viz, to weave in. Some derive the word
loom from the Saxon Loma, or geloma, which signifies
utensils or vessels generally. However, this may be, the
word loom, by time, is drawn to a more general significa-
tion than it bore at the first, comprehending all imple-
ments of household, as tables, presses, cupboards, bed-
steads, wainscots, and which, by the custom of some coun-
tries, having belonged to a house are never inventoried
after the decease of the owner as chattels, but accrue to
the heir with the house itself. Minshew; 2 Poll. & Maitl.

## HEIRS

Technically, those persons designated by
law to succeed to the estate in case of intestacy.
Potter v. Potter, 306 Ill. 37, 137 N.E. 425, 426. See,
also, Heir.
A word used in deeds of conveyance, (either
solely, or in connection with others,) where it is
intended to pass a fee.
It is generally a word of limitation, and is not to be con-
strued as a word of purchase unless there are other control-
ling words showing such intention by the person using it.
McKnight v. Black, 240 Ky. 818, 43 S.W.2d 53, 54.
In the word is comprehended heirs of heirs in infinitum.
Co. Litt. 7b, 9a; Larew v. Larew, 146 Va. 134, 135 S.E. 819,
It may have different meanings, just as under the Eng-
lish law the singular form, "heir," might have different
meanings, but, if there is no context, the word "heirs"
must be held to indicate the indefinite succession by inheri-
tance. .7Etna Life Ins. Co. v. Hoppin, C.C.A., 214 F. 928,
932. Under the terms of particular wills, however, or
under statutes abolishing the rule in Shelley's Case, Men-
ard v. Campbell, 180 Mich. 583, 147 N.W. 556, 558, Ann.Cas.
1916A, 802; it may be a word of purchase, and is fre-
quently deemed synonymous with "children," Cultice v.
Mills, 97 Ohio St. 112, 119 N.E. 200, 201; Williams v. J. C.
Armiger & Bro., 129 Md. 222, 98 A. 542, 544.
A devise or bequest to "heirs" primarily means those
who are heirs at the testator's death, and it is only when a
contrary intention appears that this presumption fails. In
re Bump's Will, 234 N.Y. 60, 136 N.E. 295, 296.
Bodily heirs. In a technical sense, the same as
"heirs of the body." Hartman v. Flynn, 189 N.C.
452, 127 S.E. 517, 519.
Normally, words of limitation, not of purchase. Stamey
v. McGinnis, 145 Ga. 226, 88 S.E. 935, 936. But they may
be used synonymously with "children." Scott v. Scott, 172
Ky. 658, 190 S.W. 143.
Joint heirs. Co-heirs. The term is also applied
to those who are or will be heirs to both of two
designated persons at the death of the survivor
of them, the word "joint" being here applied to
the ancestors rather than the heirs. See Gardiner
v. Fay, 182 Mass. 492, 65 N.E. 825.
Lawful heirs. The same as "heirs." In re
Irish's Estate, 89 Vt. 56, 94 A. 173, 174, Ann.Cas.
1917C, 1154. In a general sense, those whom the
law recognizes as the heirs of a decedent, but in
a special and technical sense, lineal descendants
only. Abbott v. Essex Co., 18 How. 215, 15 L.Ed.
Legitimate heirs. Children born in lawful wed-
lock and their descendants, not including collateral
Beveridge, 58 N.Y. 605; Prindle v. Beveridge, 7
Lans., N.Y., 231. Sometimes synonymous with
"lawful" heir. Corison v. Williams, 58 Cal.App.
282, 208 P. 331, 334.
Lineal heir. See Lineal Heir.
Living heirs. Technically words of description
instead of purchase. Johnson v. Coler, 187 Iowa,
734, 174 N.W. 654, 655.
Under a will giving the testator's wife an estate for life,
at her death all the property to be equally divided between
"our living children or to their living heirs," the words
"living heirs" should be given their technical meaning as
Including all the legal heirs of the deceased children of
testator that died after the death of testator. Potter v.
Potter, 306 Ill. 37, 137 N.E. 425, 427.
Natural heirs. Heirs by consanguinity as dis-
tinguished from heirs by adoption, and also as dis-
tinguished from collateral heirs. Smith v. Pen-
dell, 19 Conn. 112, 48 Am.Dec. 146; children; heirs
of the body, Maynard v. Henderson, 117 Ark. 24,
173 S.W. 831, 832, Ann.Cas.1917A, 1157. Yarring-
ton v. Freeman, 201 Ky. 135, 255 S.W. 1034, 1035.

## HEIRS AND ASSIGNS

Ordinarily words of lim-
itation and not of purchase. In re Knapp's Will, 6
N.Y.S.2d 100, 168 Misc. 487. At common law, the
words were essential to conveyance granting title
in fee simple, and though they are unnecessary
for that or any purpose under statute when used
in wills or deeds, words still have that meaning.
In re Denari's Will, 300 N.Y.S. 1279, 165 Misc. 450.

## HEIRSHIP

The quality or condition of being
heir, or the relation between the heir and his an-
cestor. It is a legal right, regulated by law, to be
enjoyed subject to the provisions of the statute.
Winke v. Olson, 164 Wis. 427, 160 N.W. 164, 166.

## HEIRSHIP MOVABLES

In Scotch law. The
movables which go to the heir, and not to the
executor, that the land may not go to the heir
completely dismantled, such as the best of furni-
ture, horses, cows, etc., but not fungibles. Er-
skine, Inst. 3. 8. 13-17.

lateral paralysis; paralysis of one side of the body,
commonly due to a lesion in the brain, but some-
times originating from the spinal cord, as in
"Brown-Sequard's paralysis," unilateral paralysis
with crossed ancesthesia. In the cerebral form,
ed, that is, occurring on the opposite side of the
body from the initial lesion.
Paralysis of half of the body, as of both legs or of both
arms, or an arm and leg. Gray v. United States, C.C.A.
Ark., 109 F.2d 728. 729. If the disease comes on rapidly or
suddenly, it is called "quick" hemiplegia; if slowly or
gradually, "chronic." The former variety is more apt to
affect the mental faculties than the latter; but, where
hemiplegia is complete, the operations of the mind are gen-
erally much impaired. Baughman v. Baughman, 32 Kan.
538, 4 P. 1003.
HEMOLDBORH, or HELMELBORCH. A title to
possession. The admission of this old Norse
term into the laws of the Conqueror is difficult
to be accounted for; it is not found in any Anglo-
Saxon law extant. Wharton.

## HENCEFORTH

A word of futurity, which, as
employed in legal documents, statutes, and the
like, always imports a continuity of action or con-
dition from the present time forward, but excludes
all the past. Thomson v. American Surety Co.,
170 N.Y. 109, 62 N.E. 1073.

## HENCHMAN

A page; an attendant; servant;
a herald. See Barnes v. State, 88 Md. 347, 41 A.
781. A footman; one who holds himself at the
bidding of another. It has come to mean here a

Act, Feb. 4, 1887. (49 U.S.C.A. §§ 1, 6, 11, 14, 15, 16,
18, 20).

## HEPTARCHY

A government exercised by seven
persons, or a nation divided into seven govern-
ments. In the year 5G0, seven different monarchies
had been formed in England by the German tribes,
namely, that of Kent by the Jutes; those of Sus-
sex, Wessex, and Essex by the Saxons; and those
of East Anglia, Bernicia, and Deira by the Angles.
To these were added, about the year 586, an eighth,
called the "Kingdom of Mercia," also founded by
the Angles, and comprehending nearly the whole
of the heart of the kingdom. These states formed
what has been designated the "Anglo-Saxon Oc-
tarchy," or more commonly, though not so cor-
rectly, the "Anglo-Saxon Heptarchy," from the cus-
tom of speaking of Deira and Bernicia under the
single appellation of the "Kingdom of Northum-
berland." Wharton.

## HERALD

In ancient law, a herald was a dip-
lomatic messenger who carried messages between
kings or states, and especially proclamations of
war, peace, or truce. In English law, a herald is
an officer whose duty is to keep genealogical lists
and tables, adjust armorial bearings, and regu-
late the ceremonies at royal coronations and fun-
erals.

## HERALDRY

The art, office, or science of her-
alds. Also an old and obsolete abuse of buying

## HERALDS' COLLEGE

In England. An ancient
royal corporation, first instituted by Richard III.
in 1483. It comprises three kings of arms, six
heralds, and four marshals or pursuivants of
arms, together with the earl marshal and a sec-
retary. The heralds' books, compiled when prog-
resses were solemnly and regularly made into
every part of the kingdom, to inquire into the
state of families, and to register such marriages
and descents as were verified to them upon oath,
are allowed to be good evidence of pedigrees. The
heralds' office is still allowed to make grants of
arms and to permit change of names. 3 Starkie,
Ev. 843; Wharton.

## HERBAGE

In English law. An easement or
liberty, which consists in the right to pasture cat-
tle on another's ground.

luth, C.C.Minn., 104 F. 837. Illinois Cent. R. Co. v.
Bennett, C.C.A.Miss., 296 F. 436, 437. Its prime
essentials are the right of common enjoyment on
the one hand and the duty of public maintenance
on the other. Hildebrand v. Southern Bell Tele-
phone & Telegraph Co., 219 N.C. 402, 14 S.E.2d 252,
254, 255.
The generic name for all kinds of public ways, whether
carriage-ways, bridle-ways, foot-ways, bridges, turnpike
roads, railroads, canals, ferries or navigable rivers; 6 Mod.
255; Ang.Highw. c. 1; 3 Kent 432; City of St. Louis v.
Bell Place Realty Co., 259 Mo. 126, 168 S.W. 721, 722. As
to streets and alleys, Iowa Telephone Co. v. City of Keo-
kuk, D.C., 226 F. 82, 87; Burns v. Kendall, 96 S.C. 385, 80
S.E. 621, 622. Every public thoroughfare. Oregon Short
Line R. Co. v. Pfost, 53 Idaho 559, 27 P.2d 877. It refers
to roadway or street which can be used for travel, as dis-
tinguished from way upon which road can be or is being
constructed. Allen v. Jones, 47 S.D. 603, 201 N.W. 353.
There is a difference in the shade of meaning conveyed
by two uses of the word. Sometimes it signifies right of
free passage, in the abstract, not importing anything about
the character or construction of the way. Thus, a river
is called a "highway ;" and it has been not unusual for
congress, in granting a privilege of building a bridge, to
declare that it shall be a public highway. Again, it has
reference to some system of law authorizing the taking a
strip of land, and preparing and devoting it to the use of
travelers. In this use it imports a roadway upon the soil,
constructed under the authority of these laws. Abbott.
Commissioners of Highways. Public officers
appointed in the several counties and municipali-
ties, in many states, to take charge of the open-
ing, altering, repair, and vacating of highways

kept by the public, established by regular proceed.
ings for the purpose, or generally used by the pub-
lic for twenty years, or dedicated by the owner of
the soil and accepted by the proper authorities and
for the maintenance of which they are responsible.
State v. Gross, 119 N.C. 868, 26 S.E. 91.
It includes roads, streets, alleys, lanes, courts, places,
trails, and bridges, laid out or erected as such by the pub-
lic, or, if laid out and erected by others, dedicated or aban-
doned to the public, or made such in actions for the parti-
tion of real property. Patterson v. Munyan, 93 Cal. 128, 29
P. 250.
It has been said that if the word "highway" is given
its customary meaning, the phrase "public highway" is an
example of tautology—the needless or useless repetition
of the same idea, of which the law seems to furnish so
many illustrations. See Galloway v. Wyatt Metal & Boiler
Works, 181 So. 187, 189 La. 837; Blashfield, Cyc. of Auto-
mobile Law and Prac., Perm. Ed., § 3.

## HOMAGE

In feudal law. A service (or the cere-
mony of rendering it) which a tenant was bound
to perform to his lord on receiving investiture of
a fee, or succeeding to it as heir, in acknowledg-
ment of the tenure. It is described by Littleton
as the most honorable service of reverence that
a free tenant might do to his lord. The ceremony
was as follows: The tenant, being ungirt and with
bare head, knelt before the lord, the latter sitting,
and held his hands extended and joined between
the hands of the lord, and said: "I become your
man [home] from this day forward, of life and
limb and earthly honor, and to you will be faith-
ful and loyal, and bear you faith, for the tene-
ments that I claim to hold of you, saving the
faith that I owe unto our sovereign lord the king,
so help me God." The tenant then received a kiss
from the lord. Homage could be done only to the
lord himself. Litt. § 85; Glanv. lib. 9, c. 1;1' Bract.
fols. 77b, 78-80; Wharton.
"Homage" is to be distinguished from "fealty," another
incident of feudalism, and which consisted in the solemn
oath of fidelity made by the vassal to the lord, whereas
homage was merely an acknowledgment of tenure. If the
homage was intended to include fealty, it was called "liege
homage ;" but otherwise it was called "simple homage."
Brown.

## HOMAGE ANCESTRAL

In feudal law. Homage
was called by this name where a man and his
ancestors had immemorially held of another and
his ancestors by the service of homage, which
bound the lord to warrant the title, and also to
hold the tenant clear of all services to superior
a tenant by homage, but not by homage ancestral.
Litt. § 143; 2 Bl.Comm. 300.

Technically, and under the modern homestead
laws, an artificial estate in land, devised to pro-

against the claims of his creditors, by withdrawing
the property from execution and forced sale, so
long as the land is occupied as a home. Bucking-
"Family," see that title.
Business Homestead. In Texas, a place or prop-
erty (distinct from the home of a family) used
and occupied by the head of a family as a place
to exercise his calling or business, which is exempt
by law. Spence v. State Nat. Bank of El Paso,
Tex.Civ.App., 294 S.W. 618, 623. A curious mis-
nomer, the word "homestead" in this phrase hav-
ing lost entirely its original meaning, and being
retained apparently only for the sake of its re-
mote and derivative association with the idea of
an exemption.
Homestead Corporations. Corporations organ-
ized for the purpose of acquiring lands in large
tracts, paying off incumbrances thereon, improv-
ing and subdividing them into homestead lots or

place of a family in a city, claimed or set apart

lot, and such lots as are used in connection there-
with, contributing to its enjoyment, comfort, and
convenience. Harris v. Matthews, 36 Tex. 424, 81
S.W. 1204. Nevertheless, property may be located
within the corporate limits of a town or city, and
still constitute a "rural homestead," or it may be
without the corporate limits, and constitute an
"urban homestead." Boerner v. Cicero Smith
Lumber Co., Tex.Civ.App., 293 S.W. 632, 636.

## HOMICIDAL

Pertaining to homicide; relating
to homicide, impelling to homicide; as a homi-
cidal mania. (See Insanity.)
HOMICIDE. The killing of any human creature.
4 Bl.Comm. 177. The killing of one human being
by the act, procurement, or omission of another.
Pen. Code N. Y. § 179. The act of a human being
in taking away the life of another human being.
Sanders v. State, 113 Ga. 267, 38 S.E. 84,2. Hogan
v. State, 127 Tex.Cr.R. 182, 74 S.W.2d 988, 994.
Homicide is not necessarily a crime. It is a necessary
ingredient of the crimes of murder and manslaughter, but
there are other cases in which homicide may be committed
as, where it is done in the lawful execution of a judicial
sentence, in self-defense, or as the only possible means of
arresting an escaping felon. The term "homicide" is
neutral; while it describes the act, it pronounces no judg-
ment on its moral or legal quality. People v. Connors, 35
N.Y.S. 475, 13 Misc. 582.
Classification
Homicide is ordinarily classified as "justifiable," "excus-
able," and "felonious." For the definitions of these terms,
and of some other compound terms, see infra.
Culpable homicide
Described as a crime varying from the very lowest culpa-
bility, up to the very verge of murder. Lord Moncrieff,
Arkley, 72.
Excusable homicide
The killing of a human being, either by misadventure or
in self-defense. U. S. v. King, C.C.N.Y., 34 F. 306. The
name itself imports some fault, error, or omission, so triv-
ial, however, that the law excuses it from guilt of felony,
though in strictness it judges it deserving of some little
degree of punishment. 4 Bl.Comm. 182. It is of two sorts,
—either per infortunium, by misadventure, or se defen-
dendo, upon a sudden affray. Homicide per infortunium is
where a man, doing a lawful act, without any intention of
hurt, unfortunately kills another; but, if death ensue from
any unlawful act, the offense is manslaughter, and not mis-
adventure. Homicide se defendendo is where a man kills
another upon a sudden affray, merely in his own defense,
or in defense of his wife, child, parent, or servant, and not
from any vindictive feeling. 4 BI.Comm. 182.
Felonious homicide
The wrongful killing of a human being, of any age or

Synonyms
In law, there is no difference whatever between the terms
"hotel," "inn," and "tavern," except that in some states a
statutory definition has been given to the word "hotel,"
especially with reference to the grant of licenses to sell
liquor, as, that it shall contain a certain number of sepa-
rate rooms for the entertainment of guests, or the like.
But none of the three terms mentioned will include a
boarding house (because that is a place kept for the enter-
tainment of permanent boarders, while a hotel or inn is
for travelers and transient guests), nor a lodging house
(because the keeper thereof does not furnish food for
guests, which is one of the requisites of a hotel or inn), nor
a restaurant or eating-house, which furnishes food only
and not lodging. Martin v. State Ins. Co., 44 N.J.Law, 485,
43 Am.Rep. 397; Debenham v. Short, Tex.Civ.App., 199
S. W. 1147.

## HUNDRED

Under the Saxon organization of
England, each county or shire comprised an in-
definite number of hundreds, each hundred con-
taining ten tithings, or groups of ten families of
freeholders or frankpledges. The hundred was
governed by a high constable, and had its own
court; but its most remarkable feature was the
corporate responsibility of the whole for the
crimes or defaults of the individual members. The
introduction of this plan of organization into Eng-
land is commonly ascribed to Alfred, but the idea,
as well of the collective liability as of the division,
was probably known to the ancient German peo-
ples, as we find the same thing established in the
Frankish kingdom under Clothaire, and in Den-
mark. See 1 Bl. Comm. 115; 4 Bl. Comm. 411.

in all respects except that in point of territory it
is of greater jurisdiction. These courts have long
since fallen into desuetude. 3 Bl. Comm. 34, 35;

in some of the cases, it should be sufficient to

## HYPOTHEC

In Scotland, the term "hypothec"
is used to signify the landlord's right which, in-
dependently of any stipulation, he has over the
crop and stocking of his tenant. It gives a secur-
ity to the landlord over the crop of each year for
the rent of that year, and over the cattle and
stocking on the farm for the current year's rent,
which last continues for three months after the
last conventional term for the payment of the
rent. Bell.

## HYPOTHECA

"Hypotheca" was a term of the
Roman 'law, and denoted a pledge or mortgage.
As distinguished from the term "pignus," in the
same law, it denoted a mortgage, whether of lands
or of goods, in which the subject in pledge re-
or; whereas in the pignus the mortgagee or credi-
tor was in the possession. Such an hypotheca
might be either express or implied; express, where
the parties upon the occasion of a loan entered
into express agreement to that effect; or implied,
as, e. g., in the case of the stock and utensils of a
farmer, which were subject to the landlord's right
as a creditor for rent; whence the Scotch law of
hypothec.
The word has suggested the term "hypothecate,"
as used in the mercantile and maritime law of
England. Thus, under the factor's act, goods are
frequently said to be "hypothecated;" and a cap-
tain is said to have a right to hypothecate his
vessel for necessary repairs. Brown. See Mac-
keld. Rom. Law, §§ 334-359.

## HYPOTHECARIA ACTIO

Lat. In the civil law.

mortgage.") Civ. Code La. arts. 1433-1443; Code
Prac. La. art. 61.

## HYPOTHECARII CREDITORES

## HYPOTHECARY ACTION

The name of an ac-

Sup.Ct. 1024, 34 L.Ed. 372.
An hypothecary action is a real action, which the creditor
brings against the property which has been hypothecated
to him by his debtor, in order to have it seized and sold
for the payment of his debt. Code Prac.La. art. 61. In the
hypothecary action proper, there is no pursuit of the per-
son; the thing mortgaged is the debtor, and the action is
directed against it. In this sense, the action is real. Wis-
dom v. Parker, 31 La. Ann. 52.

## HYPOTHECATE

To pledge a thing without de-
livering the possession of it to the pledgee. "The
master, when abroad, and in the absence of the
owner, may hypothecate the ship, freight, and
cargo, to raise money requisite for the completion
of the voyage." 3 Kent, Comm. 171. Ogden v.
Lathrop, 31 N.Y.Super.Ct. 651.

## HYPOTHECATION

The term borrowed from the
civil law. In so far as it is naturalized in English
and American law, it means a contract of mort-
gage or pledge in which the subject-matter is not
delivered into the possession of the pledgee or
pawnee; or, conversely, a conventional right ex-
isting in one person over specific property of an-
other, which consists in the power to cause a sale
of the same, though it be not in his possession, in
order that a specific claim of the creditor may be
satisfied out of the proceeds. Whitney v. Peay, 24
Ark. 27.
The term is frequently used in our textbooks and reports,
particularly upon the law of bottomry and maritime liens;
thus a vessel is said to be hypothecated for the demand of
one who has advanced money for supplies.
In the common law, there are but few, if any, cases of
hypothecation, in the strict sense of the civil law; that is,
a pledge without possession by the pledgee. The nearest
approaches, perhaps, are cases of bottomry bonds and
claims of materialmen, and of seamen for wages; but these
are liens and privileges, rather than hypothecations: Story,
Bailm. § 288.

## HYPOTHECATION BOND

A bond given in the
contract of bottomry or respondentia.

## HYPOTHEQUE

In French law. Hypothecation;
a mortgage on real property; the right vested in
a creditor by the assignment to him of real es-
tate as security for the payment of his debt, whe-
ther or not it be accompanied by possession. See
Civ. Code La. art. 3397.
It corresponds to the mortgage of real property in Eng-
lish law, and is a real charge, following the property into
whosesoever hands it comes. It may be Wale, as in the
case of the charge which the state has over the lands of its
accountants, or which a married woman has over those of
her husband; judicicare, when it is the result of a judg-
ment of a court of justice; and conventionelle, when it is
the result of an agreement of the parties. Brown.

## HYPOTHESIS

A supposition, assumption, or
theory; a theory set up by the prosecution, on a
criminal trial, or by the defense, as an explana-
tion of the facts in evidence, and a ground for
inferring guilt or innocence, as the case may be,
or as indicating a probable or possible motive for
the crime.

## HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION

A combination of
assumed or proved facts and circumstances, stat-
ed in such form as to constitute a coherent and
specific situation or state of facts, upon which
the opinion of an expert is asked, by way of evi-
dence on a trial. Howard v. People, 185 Ill. 552,
57 N.E. 441; State v. Smoak, 213 N.C. 79, 195 S.E.
72, 81.
It should be so framed as to recite all the facts in evi-
dence which are relevant to the formation of an opinion
and then, assuming the facts recited to be true, the witness
should be asked whether he is able to form an opinion
therefrom and if so to state his opinion. McMurrey v.
State, 145 Tex.Cr.R. 439, 168 S.W.2d 858, 860.

## HYPOTHETICAL YEARLY TENANCY

The bas-
is, in England, of rating lands and hereditaments
to the poor-rate, and to other rates and taxes that
are expressed to be leviable or assessable in like
manner as the poor-rate.

## HYRNES

In old English law. A parish.

## HYSTERIA

A paroxysmal disease or disorder of
the nervous system, more common in females than
males, not originating in any anatomical lesion,
due to psychic rather than physical causes, and
attended, in the acute or convulsive form, by ex-
traordinary manifestations of secondary effects of
extreme nervousness.
Hysteria is a state in which ideas control the body and
produce morbid changes in its functions. Mcebius. A
special psychic state, characterized by symptoms which
can also be produced or reproduced by suggestion, and
which can be treated by psychotherapy or persuasion,
hysteric and hypnotic states being practically equivalent to
each other. Babinski. A purely psychic or mental disorder
due to hereditary predisposition. Charcot. A state result-
ing from a psychic lesion or nervous shock, leading to
repression or aberration of the sexual instinct. Freud.
Hysteria is much more common in women than in men, and
was formerly thought to be due to some disorder of the
uterus or sexual system; but it is now known that it may
occur in men, in children, and in very aged persons of
either sex.
In the convulsive form of hysteria, commonly called
"hysterics" or "a fit of hysterics," there is nervestorm
characterized by loss or abandonment of self-control in the
expression of the emotions, particularly grief, by parox-
ysms of tears or laughter or both together, sensations of
constriction as of a ball rising in the throat (globes hys-
tericus), convulsive movements in the chest, pelvis, and
abdomen, sometimes leading to a fall with apparent uncon-
sciousness, followed by a relapse into semiunconsciousness
or catalepsy. In the non-convulsive forms, all kinds of
organic paralyses may be simulated, as well as muscular
contractions and spasms, tremor, loss of sensation (anes-
thesia) or exaggerated sensation (hypercesthesia), disturb-
ances of respiration, disordered appetite, accelerated pulse,
hemorrhages in the skin (stigmata), pain, swelling, or even
dislocation of the joints, and great amenability to sugges-
tion.
HYSTERO–EPILEPSY. See Epilepsy.
HYSTEROPOTMOL Those who, having been
thought dead, had, after a long absence in for-
eign countries, returned safely home; or those
who, having been thought dead in battle, had af-
terwards unexpectedly escaped from their enemies
and returned home. These, among the Romans,
were not permitted to enter their own houses at
the door, but were received at a passage opened
in the roof. Enc. Lond.
