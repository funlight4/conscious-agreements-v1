ID CERTUM EST QUOD CERTUM REDDI PO-
TEST, SED ID MAGIS CERTUM EST QUOD DE

## IDEM

Lat. The same. According to Lord Coke,
"idem" has two significations, sc., idem syllabus
seu verbis, (the same in syllabus or words,) and
idem re et sense, (the same in substance and in
sense.) 10 Coke, 124a.
In Old Practice. The said, or aforesaid; said,
aforesaid. Distinguished from "prcedictus" in old
entries, though having the same general significa-
tion. Townsh. P1.15, 16.
IDEM AGENS ET PATIENS ESSE NON POTEST.
Jenk. Cent. 40. The same person cannot be both

2 Inst. 178.
IDEM EST NON ESSE, ET NON APPARERE.
It is the same thing not to be as not to appear.
Jenk. Cent. 207. Not to appear is the same thing

## IDEM EST SCIRE AUT SCIRE DEBERE AUT POTUISSE

To be bound to know or to be able to
know is the same as to know.

## IDEM PER IDEM

## IDEM SEMPER ANTECEDENTI PROXIMO RE- FERTUR

Co. Litt. 685. "The same" is always
referred to its next antecedent.

## IDEM SONANS

Sounding the same or alike;
having the same sound. A term applied to names
which are substantially the same, though slightly
varied in the spelling, as "Lawrence" and "Lawn
ance," and the like. 1 Cromp. & M. 806; 3 Chit.
Gen. Pr. 171; Golson v. State, 15 Ala.App. 420, 73
So. 753.
Two names are said to be "idem sonantes" if the atten-
tive ear finds difficulty in distinguishing them when pro-
nounced, or if common and long-continued usage has by
corruption or abbreviation made them identical in pro-
nunciation. State v. Griffle, 118 Mo. 188, 23 S.W. 878. The
rule of "idem sonans" is that absolute accuracy in spelling
names is not required in a legal document or proceedings
either civil or criminal; that if the name, as spelled in the
document, though different from the correct spelling
thereof, conveys to the ear, when pronounced according to
the commonly accepted methods, a sound practically iden-
tical with the correct name as commonly pronounced, the
name thus given is a sufficient identification of the individ-
ual referred to, and no advantage can be taken of the cleri-
cal error. State v. Hattaway, 180 La. 12, 156 So. 159. But
the doctrine of "idem sonans" has been much enlarged by
modern decisions, to conform to the growing rule that a
variance, to be material, must be such as has misled the
opposite party to his prejudice.

## IDENTICAL

Exactly the same for all practical
purposes. Cam v. Moore, 74 Fla. 77, 76 So. 337,
IDENTIFICATION. Proof of identity; the prov-
ing that a person, subject, or article before the
court is the very same that he or it is alleged,
charged, or reputed to be; as where a witness
recognizes the prisoner at the bar as the same
person whom he saw committing the crime; or
where handwriting, stolen goods, counterfeit coin,
etc., are recognized as the same which once passed
under the observation of the person identifying
them. Hall v. Cotton, 167 Ky. 464, 180 S.W. 779,
781, L.R.A.1916C, 1124.

## IDENTITAS VERA COLLIGITUR EX MULTITU- DINE SIGNORUM

True identity is collected
from a multitude of signs. Bac. Max.

## IDENTITATE NOMINIS

In English law. An an-
cient writ (now obsolete) which lay for one taken
and arrested in any personal action, and commit.
ted to prison, by mistake for another man of the
same name. Fitzh. Nat. Brev. 267.

## IDENTITY

In the Law of Evidence. Sameness;
the fact that a subject, person, or thing before
a court is the same as it is represented, claimed,
or charged to be. Burrill, Circ. Ev. 382, 453, 631,
In Patent Law. Such sameness between two
designs, inventions, combinations, etc., as will con-
stitute the one an infringement of the patent
granted for the other.
To constitute "identity of invention," and therefore
infringement, not only must the result obtained be the
same, but, in case the means used for its attainment is a
combination of known elements, the elements combined in
both cases must be the same, and combined in the same
way, so that each element shall perform the same function:
provided that the differences alleged are not merely color-
able according to the rule forbidding the use of known
equivalents. Electric Railroad Signal Co. v. Hall Railroad
Signal Co., 114 U.S. 87, 5 Sup.Ct. 1069, 29 L. Ed. 96; Latta
v. Shawk, 14 Fed.Cas. 1188. "Identity of design" means
sameness of appearance, or, in other words, sameness of
effect upon the eye,—not the eye of an expert, but of an
ordinary intelligent observer. Smith v. Whitman Saddle
Co., 148 U.S. 674, 13 Sup.Ct. 768, 37 L.Ed. 606.

## IDEO

Lat. Therefore. Calvin.

## IDEO CONSIDERATUM EST

## IDES

A division of time among the Romans.
In March, May, July, and October, the Ides were

months, on the 13th. This method of reckoning
is still retained in the chancery of Rome, and in
the calendar of the breviary. Wharton.
Under the word "Ides" in Bouvier's Law Diet., Rawle's
3d Rev., p. 1486, will be found a complete table of the
calends, nones, and ides.

## IDIOCHIRA

instrument privately executed, as distinguished
from such as were executed before a public officer.
Cod. 8, 18, 11; Calvin.

## IDIOCY, IDIOPATHIC INSANITY

## IDIOPATHIC DISEASE

A morbid state or con-
dition not preceded or occasioned by any other
disease. Christ v. Pacific Mutual Life Ins. Co.,
231 Ill.App. 439.

## IDIOT

A person who has been without under-
standing from his nativity, and whom the law,
therefore, presumes never likely to attain any.
Shelf. Lun. 2. See Insanity. State v. Haner, 186
Iowa, 1259, 173 N.W. 225; Jones v. Commonwealth,
154 Ky. 752, 159 S.W. 568, 569.

## IDIOTA

In the Civil Law. An unlearned, illi-
terate, or simple person. Calvin. A private man;
one not in office.
In Common Law. An idiot or fool,
IDIOTA INQUIRENDO, WRIT DE. This is the
name of an old writ which directs the sheriff to
inquire whether a man be an idiot or not. The
inquisition is to be made by a jury of twelve men.
Fitzh. Nat. Brev. 232. And, if the man were found
an idiot, the profits of his lands and the custody
of his person might be granted by the king to any
subject who had interest enough to obtain them.
1 Bl.Comm. 303.
IDONEUM SE FACERE; IDONEARE SE. To
purge one's self by oath of a crime of which one

solvent person; a good and lawful man. Suffi-
cient; adequate; satisfactory. Idonea cautio, suf-
ficient security.

## IDONIETAS

In old English law. Ability or fit-
ness (of a parson). Artic. Cleri, c. 13.
IF. In deeds and wills, this word, as a rule, im-
plies a condition precedent, unless it be controlled

## IGNITEGIUM

## IGNOMINY

Public disgrace; infamy; reproach;
dishonor. Ignominy is the opposite of esteem.
Wolff, § 145. See Brown v. Kingsley, 38 Iowa
IGNORAMUS. Lat. "We are ignorant;" "We
ignore it." Formerly the grand jury used to write
this word on bills of indictment when, after hav-
ing heard the evidence, they thought the accusa-
tion against the prisoner was groundless, intimat-
ing that, though the facts might possibly be true,
the truth did not appear to them; but now they
usually write in English the words "Not a true
bill," or "Not found," if that is their verdict; but
they are still said to ignore the bill. Brown.

## IGNORANCE

The want or absence of knowl-
edge.
Ignorance of law is want of knowledge or acquaintance
with the laws of the land in so far as they apply to the act,
relation, duty, or matter under consideration. Ignorance
of fact is want of knowledge of some fact or facts constitut-
ing or relating to the subject-matter in hand. Marshall v.
Coleman, 187 Ill. 556, 58 N.E. 628.
Ignorance is not a state of the mind in the sense in
which sanity and insanity are. When the mind is ignorant
of a fact, its condition still remains sound; the power of
thinking, of judging, of willing, is just as complete before
communication of the fact as after ; the essence or texture,
so to speak, of the mind, is not, as in the case of insanity,
affected or impaired. Ignorance of a particular fact con-
sists in this : that the mind, although sound and capable of
healthy action, has never acted upon the fact in question,
because the subject has never been brought to the notice
of the perceptive faculties. Meeker v. Boylan, 28 N.J.Law,
Synonyms
"Ignorance" and "error" or "mistake" are not
convertible terms. The former is a lack of infor-
mation or absence of knowledge; the latter, a
misapprehension or confusion of information, or
a mistaken supposition of the possession of knowl-
edge. Error as to a fact may imply ignorance
of the truth; but ignorance does not necessarily
imply error. Cuibreath v. Culbreath, 7 Ga. 70, 50
Am.Dec. 375.
General
Culpable ignorance is that which results from
a failure to exercise ordinary care to acquire
knowledge, and knowledge which could be ac-
quired by the exercise of ordinary care is by law
imputed to the person and he is held to have con-
structive knowledge. Luck v. Buffalo Lakes, Tex.
Civ.App., 144 S.W.2d 672, 676.
Essential ignorance is ignorance in relation to
some essential circumstance so intimately con-
nected with the matter in question, and which so
influences the parties, that it induces them to act
in the business. Poth. Vente, nn. 3, 4; 2 Kent,
Comm. 367.
Nonessential or accidental ignorance is that
which has not of itself any necessary connection
with the business in question, and which is not the
true consideration for entering into the contract.
Involuntary ignorance is that which does not
proceed from choice, and which cannot be over-
come by the use of any means of knowledge
known to a person and within his power; as the
ignorance of a law which has not yet been prom-
ulgated.
Voluntary ignorance exists when a party might,
by taking reasonable pains, have acquired the
necessary knowledge. For example, every man
might acquire a knowledge of the laws which
have been promulgated. Doct. & Stud. 1, 46;
Plowd. 343.

## IGNORANTIA

Lat. Ignorance; want of knowl-
edge. Distinguished from mistake, (error,) or
wrong conception. Mackeld. Rom. Law, § 178;
Dig. 22, 6. Divided by Lord Coke into ignorantia
facti (ignorance of fact) and ignorantia juris
(ignorance of law). And the former, he adds, is
twofold—lectionis et linquce (ignorance of reading
and ignorance of language). 2 Coke, 3b.

## IGNORANTIA EORUM QUIE QUIS SCIRE TENE- TUR NON EXCUSAT

Ignorance of those things
which one is bound to know excuses not. Hale, P.
C. 42; Broom, Max. 267.

## IGNORANTIA FACTI EXCUSAT

Ignorance of
fact excuses or is a ground of relief. 2 Coke, 3b.
Acts done and contracts made under mistake or
ignorance of a material fact are voidable and re-
lievable in law and equity. 2 Kent, Comm. 491,
and notes.

## IGNORANTIA FACTI EXCUSAT, IGNORANTIA JURIS NON EXCUSAT

Ignorance of the fact
excuses; ignorance of the law excuses not. Every
man must be taken to be cognizant of the law;
otherwise there is no saying to what extent the
excuse of ignorance may not be carried. 1 Coke,
177; Broom, Max. 253.
IGNORANTIA JURIS QUOD QUISQUE TENE-
TUR SCIRE, NEMINE1YI EXCUSAT. Ignorance
of the [or a] law, which every one is bound to
know, excuses no man. A mistake in point of law
is, in criminal cases, no sort of defense. 4 Bl.
Comm. 27; 4 Steph.Comm. 81; Broom, Max. 253;
7 Car. & P. 456. And, in civil cases, ignorance
of the law, with a full knowledge of the facts,
furnishes no ground, either in law or equity, to
rescind agreements, or reclaim money paid, or
set aside solemn acts of the parties. 2 Kent,
Comm. 491, and note.

## IGNORANTIA JURIS SUI NON PRIEJUDICAT JURI

Ignorance of one's right does not preju-
dice the right. Lofft, 552.
IGNORANTIA LEGIS NEMINEM EXCUSAT.
Ignorance of law excuses no one. 4 Bouv. Inst. no.
3828; 1 Story, Eq. Jur. § 111; 7 Watts, 374.

## IGNORANTIA PRIESUMITUR UBI SCIENTIA NON PROBATUR

Ignorance is presumed where
knowledge is not proved. Bouvier.

## IGNORARE LEGIS EST LATA CULPA

To be
ignorant of the law is gross neglect. Bouvier.

## IGNORATIO ELENCHI

Lat. A term of logic,
sometimes applied to pleadings and to arguments
on appeal, which signifies a mistake of the ques-
tion, that is, the mistake of one who, failing to
discern the real question which he is to meet and
answer, addresses his allegations or arguments to
a collateral matter or something beside the point.
Case upon the Statute for Distribution, Wythe
Va. 309.

## IGNORATIS TERMINIS ARTIS, IGNORATUR ET ARS

Where the' terms of an art are unknown,
the art itself is unknown also. Co. Litt. 2a.

## IGNORE

To be ignorant of, or unacquainted
with. To disregard willfully; to refuse to rec-
ognize; to decline to take notice of. Cleburne
County v. Morton, 69 Ark. 48, 60 S.W. 307.
To reject as groundless, false or unsupported by
evidence; as when a grand jury ignores a bill of
indictment.

## IGNOSCITUR EI QUI SANGUINEM SUUM QUALITER REDEMPTUM VOLUIT

The law
holds him excused from obligation who chose to
redeem his blood (or life) upon any terms. What-
ever a man may do under the fear of losing his
life or limbs will not be held binding upon him in
law. 1 Bl.Comm. 131.

## IKBAL

Acceptance (of a bond, etc.). Wilson's
Gloss. Ind.

## IKBAL DAWA

Confession of judgment. Wil-
son's Gloss. Ind.

## IKENILD STREET

One of the four great Roman
roads in Britain; supposed to be so called from
the Iceni.

## IKRAH

Compulsion; especially constraint exer-
cised by one person over another to do an illegal
act, or to act contrary to his inclination. Wilson's
Gloss. Ind.

## IKRAR

Agreement, assent, or ratification. Wil-
son's Gloss. Ind.

## IKRAR NAMA

A deed of assent and acknowl-
edgment. Wilson's Gloss. Ind.

## ILL

In old pleading. Bad; defective in law;
null; naught; the opposite of good or valid.

## ILL FAME

Evil repute; notorious bad character.
Houses of prostitution, gaming houses, and other
such disorderly places are called "houses of ill
fame," and a person who frequents them is a per-
son of ill fame. See Boles v. State, 46 Ala. 206.

## ILLATA ET INVECTA

Lat. Things brought in-
to the house for use by the tenant were so called,
and were liable to the jus hypothecce of Roman
law, just as they are to the landlord's right of
distress at common law.

## ILLEGAL

Not authorized by law; illicit; un-
lawful; contrary to law; Protest of Downing, 164
Okl. 181, 23 P.2d 173.
Sometimes this term means merely that which lacks
authority of or support from law; but more frequently it
imports a violation. Etymologically, the word seems to
convey the negative meaning only. But in ordinary use it
has a severer, stronger signification; the idea of censure or
condemnation for breaking law is usually presented. But
the law implied in illegal is not necessarily an express stat-
ute. Things are called "illegal" for a violation of common-
law principles. And the term does not imply that the act
spoken of is immoral or wicked; it implies only a breach
of the law. Tiedt v. Carstensen, 61 Iowa, 334, 16 N.W. 214.

## ILLEGAL CONDITIONS

All those that are im-
possible, or contrary to law, immoral, or repug-
nant to the nature of the transaction.

## ILLEGAL CONTRACT

An agreement with un-
lawful object and not merely lacking in valid sub-
ject-matter, but made for positively invalid pur-
pose. American-LaFrance & Foamite Industries
v. Arlington County, 169 Va. 1, 192 S.E. 758, 761.

## ILLEGAL INTEREST

Usury; interest at a high-
er rate than the law allows. Parsons v. Babcock,
40 Neb. 119, 58 N.W. 726.

## ILLEGAL TRADE

Such traffic or commerce as
is carried on in violation of the municipal law, or
contrary to the law of nations. See Illicit.

## ILLEGALITY

That which is contrary to the
principles of law, as contradistinguished from
mere rules of procedure. It denotes a complete
defect in the proceedings. Ex parte Davis, 118 Or.
693, 247 P. 809, 811.

## ILLEGITIMACY

The condition before the law,
or the social status, of a bastard; the state or
condition of one whose parents were not inter-
married at the time of his birth.

## ILLEGITIMATE

That which is contrary to raw;
it is usually applied to bastards, or children born
out of lawful wedlock.
The Louisiana Code divided illegitimate children into two
classes : (1) Those born from two persons who, at the
moment when such children were conceived, could have
lawfully intermarried; and (2) those who are born from
persons to whose marriage there existed at the time some
legal impediment. Both classes, however, could be
acknowledged and take by devise. Compton y. Prescott,
12 Rob., La., 56.

## ILLEVIABLE

Not leviable; that cannot or
ought not to be levied. Cowell.

## ILLICENCIATUS

license. Fleta, lib. 3, c. 5, § 12.

fully married, with the implication that they ha-
bitually practice fornication. Thomas v. United
States, D.C.Mass., 14 F.2d 228, 229.

## ILLICIT DISTILLERY

One carried on without
a compliance with the provisions of the laws of
the United States relating to the taxation of spir-
ituous liquor. U. S. v. Johnson, C.C.Ga., 26 F.

## ILLICIT TRADE

Policies of marine insurance
usually contain a covenant of warranty against "il-
licit trade," meaning thereby trade which is for-
bidden, or declared unlawful, by the laws of the
country where the cargo is to be delivered. I Pars.
Mar. Ins. 614.
"It is not the same with 'contraband trade,' although the
words are sometimes used as synonymous. Illicit or pro-
hibited trade is one which cannot be carried on without
a distinct violation of some positive law of the country
where the transaction is to take place."
ILLICITE. Lat. Unlawfully. This word has a
technical meaning, and is requisite in an indict-
ment where the act charged is unlawful; as in
the case of a riot. 2 Hawk. P. C. c. 25, § 96.

## ILLICITUM COLLEGIUM

Lat. An illegal cor-
poration.

## ILLITERATE

ment of such a character as to affect the general
soundness and healthfulness of the system ser-
iously, and not a mere temporary indisposition
which does not tend to undermine or weaken the

America v. Sellers, 54 Ind.App. 326, 102 N.E. 894,
897. Zogg v. Bankers' Life Co. of Des Moines,
Iowa, C.C.A.W.Va., 62 F.2d 575, 578.

## ILLOCABLE

Incapable of being placed out or
hired.

## ILLUD

Lat. That.
ILLUD, QUOD ALIAS LICITUM NON EST,
NECESSITAS FACIT LICITUM; ET NECESSI-
TAS INDUCIT PRIVILEGIUM QUOAD JURA
PRIVATA. Bac. Max. That which is otherwise
not permitted, necessity permits; and necessity
makes a privilege as to private rights.
ILLUD, QUOD ALTERI UNITUR, EXTINGUI-
TUR, NEQUE AMPLIUS PER SE VACARE LI-
CET. Godol. Ecc. Law, 169. That which is united
to another is extinguished, nor can it be any more
independent.

## ILLUSION

In medical jurisprudence. An image
or impression in the mind, excited by some ex-
ternal object addressing itself to one or more of
the senses, but which, instead of corresponding
with the reality, is perverted, distorted, or whol-
ly mistaken, the error being attributable to the
imagination of the observer, not to any defect in
the organs of sense. See Hallucination, and see
"Delusion," under Insanity.

## ILLUSORY

Deceiving by false appearances;
nominal, as distinguished from substantial; falla-
cious; illusive. Bolles v. Toledo Trust Co., 144
Ohio St. 195, 58 N.E.2d 381, 390.

## ILLUSORY APPOINTMENT

Formerly the ap-
pointment of a merely nominal share of the prop-
erty to one of the objects of a power, in order to
escape the rule that an exclusive appointment
could not be made unless it was authorized by the
instrument creating the power, was considered il-
lusory and void in equity. But this rule has been
abolished in England. (1 Wm. IV. c. 46; 37 & 38
Vict. c. 37.) Sweet. Brown v. Fidelity Union
Trust Co., 126 N.J.Eq. 406, 9 A.2d 322.

## ILLUSORY APPOINTMENT ACT

The statute
1 Wm. IV. c. 46. This statute enacts that no ap-
pointment made after its passing, (July 16, 1830,)
in exercise of a power to appoint property, real
or personal, among several objects, shall be in-
valid, or impeached in equity, on the ground that
an unsubstantial, illusory, or nominal share only
was thereby appointed, or left unappointed, to de-
volve upon any one or more of the objects of such
power; but that the appointment shall be valid
in equity, as at law. See, too, 37 & 38 Vict. c. 37.
Wharton.

## ILLUSTRIOUS

The prefix to the title of a prince
of the blood in England.

## IMAGINE

In English law. In cases of treason
the law makes it a crime to imagine the death
of the king. But, in order to complete the crime,
this act of the mind must be demonstrated by
some overt act. The terms "imagining" and "com-
passing" are in this connection synonymous. 4
Bl. Comm. 78.
IMAN, IMAM, or IMAUM. A Mohammedan
prince having supreme spiritual as well as tem-
poral power; a regular priest of the mosque.

## IMBARGO

## IMITATION

The making of one thing in the
similitude or likeness of another; as, counterfeit
coin is said to be made "in imitation" of the gen-
uine. Wagner v. Daly, 67 Hun. 477, 22 N.Y.S. 493.
An imitation of a trade-mark is that which so far resem-
bles the genuine trade-mark as to be likely to induce the
belief that it is genuine, whether by the use of words or
letters similar in appearance or in sound, or by any sign,
device, or other means.
The test of "colorable imitation" is, not whether a dif-
ference may be recognized between the names of two com-
peting articles when placed side by side, but whether the
difference will be recognized by the purchaser with no
opportunity for comparison. The Best Foods v. Hemphill
Packing Co., D.C.Del., 5 F.2d 355, 357.

## IMMATERIAL

Not material, essential, or nec-
essary; not important or pertinent; not decisive;
of no substantial consequence; without weight;
of no significance. State v. Cordaro, 211 Iowa 224,
233 N.W. 51, 53.

## IMMATERIAL AVERMENT

An averment alleg-
ing with needless particularity or unnecessary cir-
cumstances what is material and necessary, and
which might properly have been stated more gen-
erally, and without such circumstances and par-
ticulars; or, in other words, a statement of un-
necessary particulars in connection with and as
descriptive of what is material. Dunlap v. Kelly,
105 Mo.App. 1, 78 S.W. 664; Bulova v. E. L. Bar-
nett, Inc., 111 Misc. 150, 181 N.Y.S. 247, 250.

## IMMATERIAL FACTS

Those which are not es-
sential to the right of action or defense.

## IMMATERIAL ISSUE

In pleading. An issue
taken on an immaterial point; that is, a point not
proper to decide the action. Steph. Pl. 99, 130;
2 Tidd, Pr. 921.

## IMMATERIAL VARIANCE

Discrepancy be-
tween the pleading and proof of a character so
slight that the adverse party cannot say that he
was misled thereby. E. B. Ryan Co. v. Russell,
52 Mont. 596, 161 P. 307, 308.

## IMMEDIATE

Present; at once; without delay;
not deferred by any interval of time.. In this
sense, the word, without any very precise signifi-
cation, denotes that action is or must be taken
either instantly or without any considerable loss
of time. A reasonable time in view of particular
facts and circumstances of case under considera-
tion. Mullins v. Masonic Protective Ass'n, 181 Mo.
App. 394, 168 S.W. 843, 844. George v. Aetna Cas-
ualty and Surety Co., 121 Neb. 647, 238 N.W. 36,
38. Next in line or relation; directly connected;
not secondary or remote. Bunner v. Patti, 343
Mo. 274, 121 S.W.2d 153, 155. Not separated in
respect to place; not separated by the interven-
tion of any intermediate object, cause, relation, or
right. Thus we speak of an action as prosecuted
for the "immediate benefit" of A., of a devise as
made to the "immediate issue" of B., etc.

## IMMEDIATE CAUSE

The last of a series or
chain of causes tending to a given result, and
which, of itself, and without the intervention of
any further cause, .directly produces the result or
event. Deisenrieter v. Kraus-Merkel Malting Co.,
72 N.W. 735, 97 Wis. 279; Longabaugh v. Rail-
road Co., 9 Nev. 271. See, also, Proximate.
A cause may be immediate in this sense, and yet not
"proximate ;" and conversely, the proximate cause (that
which directly and efficiently brings about the result) may
not be immediate. The familiar illustration is that of a
drunken man falling into the water and drowning. His
intoxication is the proximate cause of his death, if it can
be said that he would not have fallen into the water when
sober; but the immediate cause of death is suffocation by
drowning.
IMMEDIATE CONTROL (of motor vehicle upon
approaching or traversing railroad crossing).
Such constant control as would enable driver to
instantly govern vehicle's movements, including
the power to stop within a distance in which such
a vehicle, in good mechanical condition, driven by
a reasonably skillful driver, and traveling at a
'lawful rate of speed, could be stopped. Central of
Georgia Ry. Co. v. Burton, 125 S.E. 868, 33 Ga.
App. 199.

## IMMEDIATE DESCENT

See Descent.

## IMMEDIATE NOTICE

As required by policy as
for proof of loss means within a reasonable time.
Lydon v. New York Life Ins. Co., C.C.A.Mo., 89
F.2d 78, 82.

## IMMEDIATELY

Without interval of time, with-
out delay, straightway, or without any delay or
lapse of time. Drumbar v. Jeddo-Highland Coal
Co., 155 Pa.Super. 57, 37 A.2d 25, 27.
The words, "immediately" and "forthwith" have the
same meaning. They are stronger than the expression
"within a reasonable time" and imply prompt, vigorous ac-
tion without any delay. Alsam Holding Co. v. Consolidat-
ed Taxpayers' Mut. Ins. Co., 4 N.Y.S.2d 498, 505, 167 Mac.

## IMMEMORIAL

Beyond human memory; time
out of mind.

## IMMEMORIAL POSSESSION

Possession of which no man living has seen the
beginning, and the existence of which he has
learned from his elders. Civ.Code La. art. 766.

## IMMEMORIAL USAGE

A practice which has
existed time out of mind; custom; prescription.
Miller v. Garlock, 8 Barb. (N.Y.) 154.

## IMMEUBLES

Fr. These are, in French law, the
immovables of English law. Things are immeu-
bles from any one of three causes: (1) From
their own nature, e. g., lands and houses; (2)
from their destination, e. g., animals and instru-
ments of agriculture when supplied by the land-
lord; or (3) by the object to which they are an-
nexed, e. g., easements. Brown.

## IMMIGRATION

The coming into a country of
foreigners for purposes of permanent residence.
The correlative term "emigration" denotes the act
of such persons in leaving their former country.

## IMMINENT

Near at hand; mediate rather than
immediate; close rather than touching; impend-
ing; on the point of happening; threatening;
menacing; perilous. Furlow v. State, 72 Fla. 464,
73 So. 362; Jaroniec v. C. 0. Hasselbarth, Inc.,
228 N.Y.S. 302, 304, 223 App.Div. 182.

## IMMINENT DANGER

In relation to homicide
in self-defense, this term means immediate dan-
ger, such as must be instantly met, such as cannot
be guarded against by calling for the assistance of
others or the protection of the law. State v.
Smith, 43 Or. 109, 71 P. 973. Or, as otherwise de-
fined, such an appearance of threatened and im-
pending injury as would put a reasonable and
prudent man to his instant defense. State v. Fon-
tenot, 50 La.Ann. 537, 23 So. 634, 69 Am.St.Rep.

## IMMINENTLY DANGEROUS ARTICLE

Kent, Comm. 67. Cf. Mobilia Sequuntur Per-
sonam.

## IMMOBILIS

Lat. Immovable. Immobilia or res
immobiles, immovable things, such as lands and
buildings. Mackeld. Rom. Law, § 160.

able bounds; not within reasonable limits. Unit-
ed States v. Oglesby Grocery Co., D.C.Ga., 264 F.
691, 695; People v. McMurchy, 249 Mich. 147, 228
N.W. 723, 726.

## IMMORAL

Contrary to good morals; inconsist-
ent with the rules and principles of morality;
inimical to public welfare according to the stand-
ards of a given community, as expressed in law or
otherwise. Exchange Nat. Bank of Fitzgerald v.
Henderson, 139 Ga. 260, 77 S.E. 36, 37, 51 L.R.A.
(N.S.) 549. Morally evil; impure; unprincipled;
vicious; or dissolute. U. S. v. One Book, Entitled

respectable members of the community. Warken-
tin v. Kleinwachter, 166 Okl. 218, 27 P.2d 160.

## IMMORAL CONSIDERATION

One contrary to
good morals, and therefore invalid. Contracts
based upon an immoral consideration are general-
ly void.

## IMMORAL CONTRACTS

IMMORALITY. That which is contra bonos mor-
es. See Immoral.

## IMMOVABLES

In the civil law. Property which,
from its nature, destination, or the object to which
it is applied, cannot move itself, or be removed.
Breaux v. Ganucheau, 3 La.App. 481, 482; Scott
v. Brennan, 3 La.App. 452, 453.
Immovable things are, in general, such as cannot either
move themselves or be removed from one place to another.
But this definition, strictly speaking, is applicable only. to
such things as are immovable by their own nature, and not
to such as are so only by the disposition of the law.

## IMMUNITY

Exemption, as from serving in an
office, or performing duties which the law general-
ly requires other citizens to perform. Ex parte
Levy, 43 Ark. 54, 51 Am.Rep. 550. Freedom from
duty or penalty. Leatherwood v. Hill, 10 Ariz.
243, 89 P. 521, 523. The term aptly describes an
exemption from taxation. Buchanan v. Knoxville
& 0. R. Co., C.C.A.Tenn., 71 F. 324, 334, 18 C.C.A.
122. A particular privilege. Webster, Dict.; Sac-
ramento Orphanage, etc., Home v. Chambers, 25
Cal.App. 536, 144 P. 317, 319.

## IMPAIR

To weaken, to make worse, to lessen in
power, diminish, or relax, or otherwise affect in an
injurious manner. Davey v. IEtna L. Ins. Co.,
C.C.N.J., 20 F. 482; State ex rel. Woman's Ben.
Ass'n v. Port of Palm Beach Dist., 121 Fla. 746,
164 So. 851, 856.

## IMPAIRING THE OBLIGATION OF CON- TRACTS

A law which impairs the obligation of
a contract is one which renders the contract in it-
self less valuable or less enforceable, whether by
changing its terms and stipulations, its legal qual-
ities and conditions, or by regulating the remedy
for its enforcement. City of Indianapolis v. Robi-
son, 186 Ind. 660, 117 N.E. 861.
To "impair the obligation of a contract" within Const.
U.S. art. 1, § 10, is to weaken it, lessen its value, or make
it worse in any respect or in any degree, and any law
which changes the intention and legal effect of the parties,
giving to one a greater and to the other a less interest or
benefit, or which imposes conditions not included in the
contract or dispenses with the performance of those
included, impairs the obligation of the contract. O'Connor
v. Hartford Accident & Indemnity Co., 97 Conn. 8, 115 A.
484, 486.
A statute "impairs the obligation of a contract" when by
its terms it nullifies or materially changes existing con-
tract obligations. Oil Fork Development Co. v. Huddle-
ston, 202 Ky. 261, 259 S.W. 334, 335; McNee v. Wall,
D.C.Fla., 4 F.Supp. 496, 498.
The word "impair" means, according to the standard
writers in our language, simply "to diminish; to injure;
to make worse," etc. It is remarkable that in framing the
provision of the federal Constitution providing that no law
should be passed, "impairing the obligation of any con-
tract," the convention did not use the term "lessen" or
"decrease" or "destroy," but one more comprehensive,
which prohibited making worse in any respect a contract
legitimate in its creation. The object, then, of its provi-
sion, may have been to establish an important principle,
and that was the entire inviolability of contracts. Blair v.
Williams, 14 Ky. (4 Litt.) 34, 35; Lapsley v. Brashears, 14
Ky. (4 Litt.) 47, 69.
See 2 Story, Const. §§ 1374-1399; 1 Kent, Comm.
413-422; Pom. Const. Law; Black, Const. Law
(3d Ed.) p. 720 et seq.

## IMPANEL

In English practice. To impanel a
jury signifies the entering by the sheriff upon a
piece of parchment, termed a "panel," the names
of the jurors who have been summoned to appear
in court on a certain day to form a jury of the
country to hear such matters as may be brought
before them. Brown.
In American practice. Besides the meaning
above given, "impanel" signifies the act of the
clerk of the court in making up a list of the jur-
ors who have been selected for the trial of a par-
ticular cause. All the steps of ascertaining who
shall be the proper jurors to sit in the trial of a
particular case up to the final formation. People
v. Poole, 284 Ill. 39, 119 N.E. 916.
Impaneling has nothing to do with drawing, selecting, or
swearing jurors, but means simply making the list of those
who have been selected. Porter v. People, 7 How.Prac.
(N.Y.) 441; State ex rel. Green v. Pearson, 153 Fla. 314,
14 So.2d 565, 567.

## IMPARCARE

In old English law. To impound.
Reg. Orig. 92b. To shut up, or confine in prison.
Inducti sunt in carcerem et imparcati, they were
carried to prison and shut up. Bract. fol. 124.

## IMPARGAMENTUM

The right of impounding
cattle.

## IMPARL

To have license to settle a litigation
amicably; to obtain delay for adjustment.

## IMPARLANCE

In early practice, imparlance
meant time given to either of the parties to an
action to answer the pleading of the other. It thus
amounted to a continuance of the action to a fur-
ther day. Literally the term signified leave given
to the parties to talk together; i. e., with a view
to settling their differences amicably. But in
modern practice it denotes a time given to the
defendant to plead.
A general imparlance is the entry of a general prayer and
allowance of time to plead till the next term, without
reserving to the defendant the benefit of any exception; so
that after such an imparlance the defendant cannot object
to the jurisdiction of the court, or plead any matter in
abatement. This kind of imparlance is always from one
term to another. Colby v. Knapp, 13 N.H. 175; Mack v.
Lewis, 67 Vt. 383, 31 Atl. 888.
A general special imparlance contains a saving of all
exceptions whatsoever, so that the defendant after this may
plead not only in abatement, but he may also plead a plea
which affects the jurisdiction of the court, as privilege. He
cannot, however, plead a tender, and that he was always
ready to pay, because by craving time, he admits that he is
not ready, and so falsifies his plea.
A special imparlance reserves to the defendant all excep-
tions to the writ, bill, or count; and therefore after it the
defendant may plead in abatement, though not to the juris-
diction of the court. 1 Tidd, Pr. 462, 463.

## IMPARSONEE

L. Fr. In ecclesiastical law.
One who is inducted and in possession of a bene-
fice. Parson imparsonee (persona impersonata).

just. Evans v. Superior Court in and for Los
Angeles County, 107 Cal.App. 372, 290 P. 662, 666.
The provision of the Bill of Rights requiring that the
that the jury must be not partial, not favoring one party
more than another, unprejudiced, distinterested, equitable,
and just, and that the merits of the case shall not be pre-
judged. Duncan v. State, 79 Tex.Cr.R. 206, 184 S.W. 195,
IMPARTIAL JURY. Within constitutional pro-
vision is one which is of impartial frame of mind
at beginning of trial, is influenced only by legal
and competent evidence produced during trial, and
bases its verdict upon evidence connecting defend-
ant with the commission of the crime charged.
Const.U.S. Amend. 6. Durham v. State, 182 Tenn.
577, 188 S.W.2d 555, 558, 160 A.L.R. 746.

Impartial Trial," see those titles.

## IMPEACH

To accuse; to charge a liability upon;
to sue. To dispute, disparage, deny, or contradict;
as, to impeach a judgment or decree; or as used
in the rule that a jury cannot "impeach their ver-
dict." Wolfgram v. Schoepke, 123 Wis. 19, 100 N.
W. 1056. To proceed against a public officer for
crime or misfeasance, before a proper court, by
the presentation of a written accusation called
"articles of impeachment."
In the Law of Evidence. To call in question the
veracity of a witness, by means of evidence ad-
duced for that purpose, or the adducing of proof
that a witness is unworthy of belief. Johnston v.
Belk-McKnight Co. of Newberry, 188 S.C. 149, 198
S.E. 395, 399.

## IMPEACHMENT

A criminal proceeding against
a public officer, before a quasi political court, in-
stituted by a written accusation called "articles
of impeachment;" for example, a written accusa-
tion by the house of representatives of the United
States to the senate of the United States against
an officer.
"Impeachment" of the Governor, within the meaning of
section 16, art. 6, of the Constitution, is the adoption of
articles of impeachment by the House of Representatives,
and the presentation thereof to the Senate, and the indica-
tion by that body that the same are accepted for the pur-
pose of permitting prosecution thereof, and the impeach-
ment of the Governor operates to suspend him; the duties
and emoluments of the office automatically devolving upon
the Lieutenant Governor for the remainder of the term or
until the disability is removed by the acquittal of the Gov-
ernor of the charges preferred against him. State v. Cham-
bers, 96 Okl. 78, 220 P. 890, 891, 30 A.L.R. 1144; People
ex rel. Robin v. Hayes, 143 N.Y.S. 325, 329, 82 Misc. 165.

allegation of the causes for an impeachment, an-
swering the same purpose as an indictment in an
Collateral impeachment. See Collateral attack.
Impeachment of annuity. A term sometimes
used in English law to denote anything that op-
erates as a hindrance, impediment or obstruction
of the making of the profits out of which the an-
nuity is to arise. Pitt v. Williams, 4 Adol. & El.
Impeachment of waste. Liability for waste com-
mitted; or a demand or suit for compensation for
waste committed upon lands or tenements by a
tenant thereof who, having only a leasehold or
particular estate, had no right to commit waste.
2 Bl. Comm. 283; Sanderson v. Jones, 6 Fla. 480,
63 Am.Dec. 217.

the making of contracts, such as coverture, in-
fancy, want of reason, etc.
In the Civil Law. Bars to marriage.
Absolute impediments are those which prevent
the person subject to them from marrying at all,
without either the nullity of marriage or its being
punishable. Dirimant impediments are those
which render a marriage void; as where one of
the contracting parties is unable to marry by rea-
son of a prior undissolved marriage. Prohibitive
impediments are those which do not render the
marriage null, but subject the parties to a punish-
ment. Relative impediments are those which re-
gard only certain persons with respect to each
other; as between two particular persons who are
related within the prohibited degrees. Bowyer,
Mod. Civil Law, 44, 45.

## IMPEDITOR

In old English law. A disturber in
the action of quare impedit. St. Marlb. c. 12.

## IMPENSIE

Lat. In the civil law. Expenses;

emperors, and also of the Kings of England be-
fore the Norman conquest. Cod. 1, 14, 12; 1 BL
Comm. 242. See Emperor.

## IMPERFECT

As used in various legal compound
terms, this word means defective or incomplete;
wanting in some legal or formal requisite; want-
ing in legal sanction or effectiveness; as in speak-
ing of imperfect "obligations," "ownership,"
"rights," "title," "usufruct," or "war." See those
nouns.
IMPERII MAJESTAS EST TUTELIE SALUS.
Co. Litt. 64. The majesty of the empire is the
safety of its protection.

## IMPERITIA

Lat. Unskillfulness; want of skill.
IMPERITIA CULP1E ADNUMERATUR. Want
of skill is reckoned as culpa; that is, as blamable
conduct or neglect. Dig. 50, 17, 132.

## IMPERITIA EST MAXIMA MECHANICORUM PCENA

Unskillfulness is the greatest punish-
ment of mechanics; [that is, from its effect in
making them liable to those by whom they are em-
ployed.] 11 Coke, 54a. The word "pcena" in some
translations is erroneously rendered "fault."
IMPERIUM. The right to command, which in-
cludes the right to employ the force of the state
to enforce the laws. This is one of the principal
attributes of the power of the executive. 1 Toul-
lier, no. 58.

## IMPERSONALITAS

mode of expression where no reference is made to
any person, such as the expression "ut dicitur,"
(as is said.) Co. Litt. 352b.

## IMPERSONALITAS NON CONCLUDIT NEC LIGAT

Co. Litt. 352 b. Impersonality neither

## IMPERTINENCE

Irrelevancy; the fault of not
properly pertaining to the issue or proceeding.
The introduction of any matters into a bill, an-
swer, or other pleading or proceeding in a suit,
which are not properly before the court for de-
cision, at any particular stage of the suit. Story,
Eq. Pl. § 266; Harrison v. Perea, 18 S.Ct. 129, 168
U.S. 311, 42 L.Ed. 478.
In Practice. A question propounded to a wit-
ness, or evidence offered or sought to be elicited,
is called "impertinent" when it has no logical bear-
ing upon the issue, is not necessarily connected
with it, or does not belong to the matter in hand.
1 Whart. Ev. § 20.
On the distinction between pertinency and relevancy, we
may quote the following remark of Dr. Wharton : "Rele-
vancy is that which conduces to the proof of a pertinent
hypothesis ; a pertinent hypothesis being one which, if
sustained, would logically influence the issue."
IMPERTINENT. In Equity Pleading. That
which does not belong to a pleading, interrogatory,
or other proceeding; out of place; superfluous;
irrelevant. Chew v. Eagan, 87 N.J.Eq. 80, 99 A.
611; Bean v. Central Maine Power Co., 133 Me. 9,
173 A. 498, 501.

796. Mississippi Road Supply Ca. v. Hester, 185
Miss. 839, 188 So. 281, 287, 124 A.L.R. 574.

## IMPLICATA

A term used in mercantile law, de-
rived from the Italian. In order to avoid the risk
of making fruitless voyages, merchants have been
in the habit of receiving small adventures, on
freight, at so much per cent, to which they are
entitled at all events, even if the adventure be
lost; and this is called "implicata." Wharton.

## IMPLICATION

Intendment or inference, as dis-
tinguished from the actual expression of a thing
in words. In a will, an estate may pass by mere
implication, without any express words to direct
its course. 2 Bl. Comm. 381.
An inference of something not directly declared, but
arising from what is admitted or expressed.
In construing a will conjecture must not be taken for
implication; but necessary implication means, not natural
necessity, but so strong a probability of intention that an
intention contrary to that which is imputed to the testator
cannot be supposed. 1 Ves. & B. 466.
"Implication" is also used in the sense of "in-
ference;" e., where the existence of an inten-
tion is inferred from acts not done for the sole
purpose of communicating it, but for some other
purpose. Sweet.
Necessary implication
In construing a will, necessary implication means not
natural necessity, but so strong a probability of intention
that an intention contrary to that which is imputed to the
testator cannot be supposed. Wilkinson v. Adam, 1 Ves. &
B. 466; Gilbert v. Craddock, 67 Kan. 346, 72 P. 869.

## IMPLIED

This word is used in law as contrasted
with "express;" e., where the intention in re-
gard to the subject-matter is not manifested by
explicit and direct words, but is gathered by im-
plication or necessary deduction from the circum-
stances, the general language, or the conduct of
the parties.
As to implied "Abrogation," "Agreement," "As-
sumpsit," "Condition," "Confession," "Consent,"
"Consideration," "Contract," "Covenant," "Dedica-
tion," "Easement," "Invitation," "Malice," "No-
tice," "Obligation," "Powers," "Trust," "Use,"
"Waiver," and "Warranty," see those titles.

## IMPORTATION

The act of bringing goods and
merchandise into a country from a foreign coun-
try. Cunard Steamship Co. v. Mellon, 43 S.Ct. 504,,
262 U.S. 100, 67 L.Ed. 894, 27 A.L.R. 1306.

## IMPORTED

This word, in general, has the same
meaning in the tariff laws that its etymology
shows, in porto, to carry in. To "import" is to
bear or carry into. An "imported" article is one
brought or carried into a country from abroad.
The Conqueror, 49 Fed. 99. See Imports.

## IMPORTS

Importations; goods or other prop-
erty imported or brought into the country from a
foreign country.

Paterson v. Society, 24 N.J.L. 400; Singer Mfg. Co.
v. Heppenheimer, 58 N.J.L. 633, 34 A. 1061, 32 L.
R.A. 643; Town of Brandon v. Harvey, 105 Vt.
435, 168 A. 708, 710.

## IMPOSSIBILITY

That which, in the constitution
and course of nature or the law, no man can do
or perform. Klauber v. San Diego Street-Car Co.,
95 Cal. 353, 30 P. 555.
Impossibility of performance of contract, absolving party
from liability for nonperformance, means not only strict
impossibility, but impracticability because of extreme arid
unreasonable difficulty, expense, injury or loss involved.
Fisher v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., 313 Ill.
App. 66, 39 N.E.2d 67, 70; Transbay Const. Co. v. City and
County of San Francisco, D.C.Cal., 35 F.Supp. 433, 436.
impossibie contract. One which the law will not hold
binding upon the parties, because of the natural or legal
impossibility of the performance by one party of that
which is the consideration for the promise of the other.
7 Wait, Act. & Def. 124.
Impossible contracts, which will be deemed void in the
eye of the law, or of which the performance will be
excused, are such contracts as cannot be performed, either
because of the nature of the obligation undertaken, or
because of some supervening event which renders the per-
formance of the obligation either physically or legally
impossible. 10 Amer. & Eng.Enc.Law, 176.
Impossibility is of the following several sorts:
An act is physically impossible when it is con-
trary to the course of nature. Such an impossi-
bility may be either absolute, i. e., impossible in
any case, (e. g., to stop earth rotation) or rela-
tive, (sometimes called "impossibility in fact")
i. e., arising from the circumstances of the case,
(e. g., for A. to make a payment to B., he being
a deceased person.) To the latter class belongs
what is sometimes called "practical impossibili-
ty," which exists when the act can be done, but
only at an excessive or unreasonable cost. An
act is legally or juridically impossible when a rule
of law makes it impossible to do it; e. g., for A.
to make a valid will before his majority. This
class of acts must not be confounded with those
which are possible, although forbidden by law, as
to commit a theft. An act is logically impossible
when it is contrary to the nature of the transac-
tion, as where A. gives property to B. expressly
for his own benefit, on condition that he transfers
it to C. Sweet.
IMPOSSIBILIUM NULLA OBLIGATIO EST.
There is no obligation to do impossible things.
Dig. 50, 17, 185; Broom, Max. 249.

## IMPOSTS

Taxes, duties, or impositions levied
for divers reasons. Crew Levick Co. v. Common-
wealth of Pennsylvania, 38 S.Ct. 126, 245 U.S.
292, 62 L.Ed. 295.
Impost is a tax received by the prince for such merchan-
dises as are brought into any haven within his dominions
from foreign nations. It may in some sort be distinguished
from customs, because customs are rather that profit the
prince maketh of wares shipped out; yet they are fre-
quently confounded. Cowell.

## IMPOTENCE

In medical jurisprudence. In-
ability to copulate. Properly used of the male;
but it has also been used synonymously with
"sterility." Smith v. Smith, 206 Mo.App. 646, 229
S.W. 398; Heinemann v. Heinemann, 118 Or. 178,
245 P. 1082, 1083.
Impotency as a ground for divorce means want of poten-
tia copulandi or incapacity to consummate the marriage,
and not merely incapacity for procreation. Reed v. Reed,
26 Tenn.App. 690, 177 S.W.2d 26, 27.

## IMPOTENTIA EXCUSAT LEGEM

Co.Litt. 29.
The impossibility of doing what is required by
the law excuses from the performance.

## IMPOTENTIAM, PROPERTY PROPTER

A
qualified property, which may subsist in animals
ferce naturce on account of their inability, as
where hawks, herons, or other birds build in a
person's trees, or conies, etc., make their nests or
burrows in a person's land, and have young there,
such person has a qualified property in them till
they can fly or run away, and then such property
expires. 2 Steph.Comm. (7th Ed.) 8.

## IMPOUND

To shut up stray animals or distrain-
ed goods in a pound. Chenango County Humane
Soc. v. Polmatier, 177 N.Y.S. 101, 103, 188 App.Div.
419. To take into the custody of the law or of a
court. Thus, a court will sometimes impound a

facts; one involving a question never before de-
termined.

## IMPRESSMENT

A power possessed by the Eng-
lish crown of taking persons or property to aid

consent of the persons concerned. It is usually
exercised to obtain hands for the royal ships in
time of war, by taking seamen engaged in mer-
chant vessels, (1 Bl.Comm. 420; Maud & P. Shipp.
123;) but in former times impressment of mer-
chant ships was also practiced. The admiralty is-
sues protections against impressment in certain
cases, either under statutes passed in favor of cer-
tain callings (e. g., persons employed in the Green-
land fisheries) or voluntarily. Sweet.

## IMPREST MONEY

ing a man in prison; the restraint of a man's per-
sonal liberty; coercion exercised upon a person
comotion. State v. Shaw, 73 Vt. 149, 50 A. 863.
It is not a necessary part of the definition that the con-
finement should be in a place usually appropriated to that
purpose; it may be in a locality used only for the specific
occasion; or it may take place without the actual applica-
tion of any physical agencies of restraint, (such as locks or
bars,) but by verbal compulsion and the display of avail-
able force. Pike v. Hanson, 9 N.H. 491. Every confinement
of the person is an "imprisonment," whether it be in a
common prison, or in a private house, or in the stocks, or
even by forcibly detaining one in the public streets. Nor-
ton v. Mathers, 222 Iowa 1170, 271 N.W. 321, 324.
False imprisonment
The unlawful arrest or detention of a person without
warrant, or by an illegal warrant, or a warrant illegally
executed, and either in a prison or a place used temporarily
for that purpose, or by force and constraint without con-
finement. Eberling v. State, 136 Ind. 117, 35 N.E. 1023.
False imprisonment consists in the unlawful detention of
the person of another, for any length of time, whereby he
is deprived of his personal liberty. Mahan v. Adam, 144
Md. 355, 124 A. 901, 904. The unlawful detention of the
occupant of an automobile may be accomplished by driv-
ing so rapidly that he cannot alight. Blashfleld, Cyc. of

lies for this species of injury. 3 Bl.Comm. 138; Buttrey v.
Wilhite, 208 Ala 573. 94 So. 585; Christ v. McDonald, 152

themselves alienable, without mutual license, or
descended indifferently to males or females.

53 Law J.P.D. 65.

## IMPROPRIATION

In ecclesiastical law. The
annexing an ecclesiastical benefice to the use of
a lay person, whether individual or corporate, in
the same way as appropriation is the annexing
any such benefice to the proper and perpetual use
of some spiritual corporation, whether sole or ag-
gregate, to enjoy forever. Brown.

## IMPROPRIATE RECTOR

In ecclesiastical law.
Commonly signifies a lay rector as opposed to a
spiritual rector; just as impropriate tithes are

and is cultivated as such, whether the appropria-
tion is for tillage, meadow, or pasture. "Improve"
is synonymous with "cultivate." Clark v. Phelps,
4 Cow. (N.Y.) 190.

## IMPROVEMENT

A valuable addition made to
property (usually real estate) or an amelioration
in its condition, amounting to more than mere re-
pairs or replacement of waste, costing labor or
capital, and intended to enhance its value, beauty
or utility or to adapt it for new or further pur-
poses. Spencer v. Tobey, 22 Barb., N.Y., 269; Al-
len v. McKay, 120 Cal. 332, 52 P. 828.
In American land law. An act by which a loca-
tor or settler expresses his intention to cultivate
or clear certain land; an act expressive of the ac-
tual possession of land; as by erecting a cabin,
planting a corn-field, deadening trees in a forest;
or by merely marking trees, or even by piling up
a brush-heap. Burrill. In re Leet Tp. Road, 159
Pa. 72, 28 A. 238.
An "improvement," under our land system, does not
mean a general enhancement of the value of the tract from
the occupant's operations. It has a more limited meaning,
which has in view the population of our forests, and the
increase of agricultural products. All works which are
directed to the creation of homes for families, or are sub-
stantial steps towards bringing lands into cultivation, have
in their results the special character of "improvements,"
and, under the land laws of the United States and of the
several states, are encouraged. Sometimes their minimum
extent is defined as requisite to convey rights. In other
cases not. But the test. which runs through all the cases
is always this : Are they real, and made bona fide, in
accordance with the policy of the law, or are they only
colorable, and made for the purpose of fraud and specula-
tion? Simpson v. Robinson, 37 Ark. 137.
In the law of patents. An addition to, or mod-
ification of, a previous invention or discovery, in-
tended or claimed to increase its utility or value.
2 Kent, Comm. 366-372. Steiner Sales Co. v.
Schwartz Sales Co., C.C.A.Utah, 98 F.2d 999, 1010.
It includes two necessary ideas: the idea of a
complete and practical operative art or instru-
ment and the idea of some change in such art or
instrument not affecting its essential character
but enabling it to produce its appropriate results
in a more perfect or economical manner. Rob.
Pat. § 210.
Local improvement. See Local Improvement.

## IMPROVEMENTS

A term used in leases, of
doubtful meaning. It would seem to apply prin-
cipally to buildings, though generally it extends
to the amelioration of every description of prop-
erty, whether real or personal; but, when con-
tained in any document, its meaning is generally
explained by other words. 1 Chit. Gen. Pr. 174.

## IMPROVIDENCE

As used in a statute exclud-
ing one found incompetent to execute the duties
of an administrator by reason of improvidence,
means that want of care and foresight in the man-
agement of property which would be likely to ren-
der the estate and effects of the intestate unsafe,
and liable to be lost or diminished in value, in case
the administration should be committed to the
improvident person. In re Fulper's Estate, 99 N.
J.Eq. 293, 132 A. 834, 843.

## IMPROVIDENTLY

A judgment, decree, rule,
injunction, etc., when given or rendered without
adequate consideration by the court, or without

fecting it, or based upon a mistaken assumption
or misleading information or advice, is sometimes
said to have been "improvidently" given or issued.

der the age of puberty; a male under fourteen

bility.

## IMPUTATION OF PAYMENT

## IMPUTED

As used in legal phrases, this word
means attributed vicariously; that is, an act, fact,
or quality is said to be "imputed" to a person
when it is ascribed or charged to him, not because
he is personally cognizant of it or responsible for
it, but because another person is, over whom he
has control or for whose acts or knowledge he is
responsible.

## IMPUTED KNOWLEDGE

This phrase is some-
times used as equivalent to "implied notice," i. e.,
knowledge attributed or charged to a person (of-
ten contrary to the fact) because the facts in ques-
tion were open to his discovery and it was his duty
to inform himself as to them. Roche v. Llewellyn
Iron Works Co., 140 Cal. 563, 74 P. 147.

## IMPUTED NEGLIGENCE

Negligence which is
not directly attributable to the person himself, but
which is the negligence of a person who is in priv-
ity with him, and with whose fault he is charge-
able. Smith v. Railroad Co., 38 N.Y.S. 666, 4 App.
Div. 493.

## IMPUTED NOTICE

Information as to a given
fact or circumstance charged or attributed to a
person, and affecting his rights or conduct on the
ground that actual notice was given to some per-
son whose duty was to report it to the person to
be affected, as, his agent or his attorney of record.
IN. In the law of real estate, this preposition has
always been used to denote the fact of seisin, ti-
tle, or possession, and apparently serves as an
elliptical expression for some such phrase as "in
possession," or as an abbreviation for "intitled" or
"invested with title." Thus, in the old books, a
tenant is said to be "in by lease of his lessor."
Litt. § 82.
An elastic preposition in other cases, expressing
relation of presence, existence, situation, inclu-
sion, action, etc.; inclosed or surrounded by limits,
as in a room; also meaning for, in and about, on,
within, etc., according to context. Ex parte Perry,
71 Fla. 250, 71 So. 174, 176. Rester v. Moody &
Stewart, 172 La. 510, 134 So. 690, 692.

## IN ACTION

## IN OBSCURA VOLUNTATE MANUMITTENTIS, FAVENDUM EST LIBERTATI

Where the ex-
pression of the will of one who seeks to manumit
a slave is ambiguous, liberty is to be favored.
Dig. 50, 17, 179.
IN OBSCURIS, INSPICI SOLERE QUOD VERI-
SIMILIUS EST, AUT QUOD PLERUMQUE FIERI
SOLET. In obscure cases, we usually look at
what is most probable, or what most commonly
happens. Dig. 50, 17, 114.

## IN OBSCURIS, QUOD MINIMUM EST SEQUI- MUR

In obscure or doubtful cases, we follow
that which is the least. Dig. 50, 17, 9; 2 Kent,
Comm. 557.

## IN ODIUM SPOLIATORIS

In hatred of a de-
spoiler, robber, or wrong-doer. The Saratoga, 1
Gall. 174, Fed.Cas.No.12,355; Arthur v. The Cas-
sius, 2 Story, 99, Fed.Cas.No.564. 1 Greenl.Ev. §

## IN ODIUM SPOLIATORIS OMNIA PRIESUM- UNTUR

To the prejudice (in condemnation) of
a despoiler all things are presumed; every pre-
sumption is made against a wrongdoer. 1 Vern.
IN OMNI ACTIONE UBI DUX CONCURRUNT
DISTRICTIONES, VIDELICET, IN REM ET IN
PERSONAM, ILLA DISTRICTIO TENENDA EST
QUPE MAGIS TIMETUR ET MAGIS LIGAT. In
every action where two distresses concur, that is,
in rem and in personam, that is to be chosen which
is most dreaded, and which binds most firmly.
Bract. fol. 372; Fleta, 1. 6, c. 14, § 28.

## IN OMNI RE NASCITUR RES QUZE IPSAM REM EXTERMINAT

In everything there arises
a thing which destroys the thing itself. Every-
thing contains the element of its own destruction.
2 Inst. 15.

## IN OMNIBUS

In all things; on all points. "A
case parallel in omnibus." 10 Mod. 104.
IN OMNIBUS CONTRACTIBUS, SIVE NOMINA-
TIS SIVE INNOMINATIS, PERMUTATIO CON-
TINETUR. In all contracts, whether nominate or
innominate, an exchange [of value, i. e., a consid-
eration] is implied. Gravin. lib. 2, § 12; 2 Bl.
Comm. 444, note.
IN OMNIBUS OBLIGATIONIBUS IN QUIBUS
DIES NON PONITUR, PRIESENTI DIE DEBET-
UR. In all obligations in which a date is not put,

accrues immediately. Dig. 50, 17, 14.

## ET 2ETATL ET IMPRUDENTI2E SUCCURRI- TUR

In nearly all penal judgments, immaturity
of age and imbecility of mind are favored. Dig.
50, 17, 108; Broom, Max. 314.

## IN OMNIBUS QUIDEM, MAXIME TAMEN IN JURE, ZEQUITAS SPECTANDA SIT

In all
things, but especially in law, equity is to be re-
garded. Dig. 50, 17, 90; Story, Bailm. § 257.

## IN PACATO SOLO

In a country which is at
peace.

## IN PACE DEI ET REGIS

In the peace of God
and the king. Fleta, lib. 1, c. 31, § 6. Formal
words in old appeals of murder.

## IN PAIS

This phrase, as applied to a legal trans-
action, primarily means that it has taken place
without legal proceedings. Thus a widow was
said to make a request in pais for her dower when
she simply applied to the heir without issuing a
writ. (Co. Litt. 32b.) So conveyances are divid-
ed into those by matter of record and those by
matter in pais. In some cases, however, "mat-
ters in pais" are opposed not only to "matters of
record," but also to "matters in writing," i. e.,
deeds, as where estoppel by deed is distinguish-
ed from estoppel by matter in pais. Id. 352a.)
Sweet. See, also, Pais.

## IN PAIS, ESTOPPEL IN

An estoppel not aris-
ing from deed or record or written contract.
Steph.Pl. 197; Duke v. Griffith, 9 Utah 476, 35
P. 512. The doctrine is that a person may be pre-
cluded by his act or conduct or silence, when it is
his duty to speak, from asserting a right which
he otherwise would have had. Marshall v. Wil-
son, 175 Or. 506, 154 P.2d 547, 551. The effect of
a party's voluntary conduct whereby he is pre-
cluded from asserting rights as against another
person who has in good faith relied upon such con-
duct and has been led thereby to change his con-
dition for the worse and who acquires some cor-
responding right of property or contract. Oswego
Falls Corporation v. City of Fulton, 265 N.Y.S. 436,
148 Misc. 170.
Elements or fundamentals of "estoppel in pals" include
admission, statement, or act inconsistent with claim after-
wards asserted, National Match Co. v. Empire Storage &
Ice Co., 227 Mo.App. 1115, 58 S.W.2d 797; Peyrefitte v.
Union Homestead Ass'n, La.App., 185 So. 693, 697; change
of position to loss or injury of party claiming estoppel,

City of Chicago, 369 Ill. 97, 15 N.E.2d 861, 865; circum-
stances such that party estopped knew or should have
known facts to be otherwise or pretended to know facts
which he did not know, Briscoe v. O'Connor, 119 N.J.Eq.

estopped, Darling Stores v. Fidelity-Bankers Trust Co.,
178 Tenn. 165, 156 S.W.2d 419, 424; Peterson v. City of
Parsons, 139 Kan. 701, 33 P.2d 715, 720; lack of knowledge
or means of knowledge of party claiming estoppel, Triplex
Shoe Co. v. Rice & Hutchins, 17 Dei.Ch. 356, 152 A. 342,
leum Process Co., C.C.A.Me., 99 F.2d 9, 13, 14; misleading
of one person by another person to his prejudice or injury,
Garmon v. Davis, 63 Ga.App. 815, 12 S.E.2d 209, 211; Cur-
rent News Features v. Pulitzer Pub. Co., C.C.A.Mo., 81 F.2d
288, 292; prejudice or loss or injury to party claiming es-
toppel, City of St. Louis v. Mississippi River Fuel Corpora-
tion, D.C.Mo., 57 F.Supp. 549, 554; In re Bremer's Estate,
141 Neb. 251, 3 N.W.2d 411, 413, 414; reliance by one party
on belief induced by other party, Clover v. Peterson, 203
Minn. 337, 281 N.W. 275, 278; Strand v. State, 16 Wash.2d
107, 132 P.2d 1011, 1016.
Ratification is distinguishable in that the substance of
"ratification" is confirmation of the unauthorized act or
contract after it has been done or made, whereas substance
of "estoppel" is the principal's inducement to another to
act to his prejudice. Harvey v. J. P. Morgan & Co.,
Mun.Ct., 2 N.Y.S.2d 520, 531, 166 Misc. 455.
Silence when one should speak may be the basis of es-
toppel, Thomas v. Conyers, 198 N.C. 229, 151 S.E. 270, 273;
waiver is distinguishable in that it is not essential to waiv-
er that the opposite party do anything on the strength of
the statement relied upon, Langley v. Norris, Tex.Civ.App.,
167 S.W.2d 603, 613; waiver designates act or consequence
of act of one person only; it is voluntary act and implies
abandonment of right or privilege. McDanels v. General
Ins. Co. of America, 1 Cal.App.2d 454, 36 P.2d 829, 832.
See, also, Equitable Estoppel.

## IN PAPER

A term formerly applied to the pro-
ceedings in a cause before the record was made
up. 3 Bl.Comm. 406; 2 Burrows, 1098. Probably
from the circumstance of the record being always
on parchment. The opposite of "on record." 1
Burrows, 322.

## IN PARI CAUSA

In an equal cause. In a cause
where the parties on each side have equal rights.

## IN PARI CAUSA POSSESSOR POTIOR HAB- ERL DEBET

In an equal cause he who has the
possession should be preferred. Dig. 50, 17, 128, 1.

## IN PARI DELICTO

In equal fault; equally cul-
pable or criminal; in a case of equal fault or
guilt. Rozell v. Vansyckle, 11 Wash. 79, 39 Pac.
A person who is in part delicto with another differs from
a particeps criminis in this, that the former term always
includes the latter, but the latter does not always include
the former. 8 East, 381.
IN PARI DELICTO POTIOR EST CONDITIO
POSSIDENTIS, [DEFENDENTIS.] In a case of
equal or mutual fault [between two parties] the
condition of the party in possession [or defend-
ing] is the better one. 2 Burrows, 926.
Where each party is equally in fault, the law favors him
who is actually in possession. Broom, Max. 290, 729.
Where the fault is mutual, the law will leave the case as it
finds it. Story, Ag. § 195; Reaves Lumber Co. v. Cain-
Hurley Lumber Co., 152 Tenn. 339, 279 S.W. 257, 258.

## IN PARI MATERIA

Upon the same matter or
subject. Statutes in pari materia are to be con-
strued together. State v. Gerhardt, 145 Ind. 439,
44 N.E. 469, 33 L.R.A. 313.

## IN PATIENDO

In suffering, permitting, or al-
lowing.

## IN PECTORE JUDICIS

judge. Latch, 180. A phrase applied to a judg-
ment.
the worst side. Latch, 159, 160.

## IN PERPETUAM REI MEMORIAM

In perpetu-
al memory of a matter; for preserving a record
of a matter. Applied to depositions taken in or-
der to preserve the testimony of the deponent.

## IN PERPETUITY

Endless duration; forever.
Central R. Co. of New Jersey v. New York Tele-
phone Co., 101 N.J.L. 353, 128 A. 160, 161.

## IN PERPETUAM REI TESTIMONIUM

In per-
petual testimony of a matter; for the purpose of
declaring and settling a thing forever. 1 Bl.
Comm. 86.

## IN PERSON

A party, plaintiff or defendant, who
sues out a writ or other process, or appears to
conduct his case in court himself, instead of
through a solicitor or counsel, is said to act and
appear in person.

## IN PERSONAM, IN REM

In the Roman law,
from which they are taken, the expressions "in
rem" and "in personam" were always opposed to
one another, an act or proceeding in personam be-
ing one done or directed against or with reference
to a specific person, while an act or proceeding
in rem was one done or directed with reference
to no specific person, and consequently against or
with reference to all whom it might concern, or
"all the world." The phrases were especially ap-
plied to actions; an actio in personam being the
remedy where a claim against a specific person
arose out of an obligation, whether ex contractu
or ex maleficio, while an actio in rem was one
brought for the assertion of a right of property,
easement, status, etc., against one who denied or
infringed it. See Inst. 4, 6, 1; Gaius, 4, 1, 1-10.
From this use of the terms, they have come to be ap-
plied to signify the antithesis of "available against a par-
ticular person," and "available against the world at large."
Thus, Jura in personam are rights primarily available
against specific persons; Jura in rem, rights only available
against the world at large. Hook v. Hoffman, 147 P. 722,
727, 16 Ariz. 540; Beck v. Natalie Oil Co., 143 La. 153, 78
So. 430.
So a judgment or decree is said to be in rem when it
binds third persons. Such is the sentence of a court of
admiralty on a question of prize, or a decree of nullity or
dissolution of marriage, or a decree of a court in a foreign
country as to the status of a person domiciled there.
Lastly, the terms are sometimes used to signify that a
judicial proceeding operates on a thing or a person. Thus,
it is said of the court of chancery that it acts in personam,
and not in rem, meaning that its decrees operate by com-
pelling defendants to do what they are ordered to do, and
not by producing the effect directly. Sweet. See Cross v.
Armstrong, 44 Ohio St. 613, 10 N.E. 160.
Judgment in Personam
See that title.
IN PERSONAM ACTIO EST, QUA CUM EO AGI-
MUS QUI OBLIGATUS EST NOBIS AD FACIEN-
DUM ALIQUID VEL DANDUM. The action in
personam is that by which we sue him who is
under obligation to us to do something or give
something. Dig. 44, 7, 25; Bract. 101b.

## IN PIOS USUS

For pious uses; for religious
purposes. 2 Bl.Comm. 505.
matter is "in place" when remaining as nature
placed it, that is, unsevered from the circumjacent
rock, or which is fixed solid and immovable in
the form of a vein or lode. Williams v. Gibson,
84 Ala. 228, 4 So. 350, 5 Am.St.Rep. 368.

## IN PLENA VITA

In full life. Yearb. P. 18 Hen.
VI. 2.

## IN PLENO COMITATU

In full county court. 3
Bl.Comm. 36.

## IN PLENO LUMINE

In public; in common
knowledge; in the light of day.

## IN PCENALIBUS CAUSIS BENIGNIUS INTER- PRETANDUM EST

In penal causes or cases,
the more favorable interpretation should be adopt-
ed. Dig. 50, 17, (197), 155, 2; Plowd. 86b, 124; 2
Hale, P.C. 365.

## IN POSSE

In possibility; not in actual exist-
ence. See In Esse.

## IN POTESTATE PARENTIS

In the power of a
parent. Inst. 1, 8, pr.; Id. 1, 9; 2 Bl.Comm. 498.

## IN PRAEMISSORUM FIDEM

In confirmation or
attestation of the premises. A notarial phrase.

## IN PRAEPARATORIIS AD JUDICIUM FAVETUR ACTORI

2 Inst. 57. In things preceding judg-
ment the plaintiff is favored.

## IN PRIESENTI

At the present time. 2 Bl.
Comm. 166. Used in opposition to in futuro. Van
Wyck v. Knevals, 1 S.Ct. 336, 106 U.S. 360, 27 L.
Ed. 201.

## IN PRIESENTIA MAJOR'S POTESTATIS, MIN- OR POTESTAS CESSAT

In the presence of the
superior power, the inferior power- ceases. Jenk.
Cent. 214, c. 53. The less authority is merged in
the greater. Broom, Max. 111.

## IN PRENDER

L. Fr. In taking. A term ap-
plied to such incorporeal hereditaments as a party
entitled to them was to take for himself; such
as common. 2 Steph.Comm. 23; 3 Bl.Comm. 15.
See In Render.
IN PRETIO EMPTIONIS ET VENDITIONIS, NA-
T1URALITER LICET CONTRAHENTIBUS SE
CIRCUMVENIRE. In the price of buying and
selling, it is naturally allowed to the contracting
parties to overreach each other. 1 Story, Cont.

## IN PRIMIS

In the first place. A phrase used in
argument.

## IN PRINCIPIO

At the beginning.

## IN PROMPTU

In readiness; at hand. Usually
written impromptu.

## IN PROPRIA CAUSA NEMO JUDEX

No one
can be judge in his own cause. 12 Code, 13.

## IN PROPRIA PERSONA

In one's own proper
person.
It is a rule in pleading that pleas to the jurisdiction of
the court must be plead in propria persona, because if
pleaded by attorney they admit the jurisdiction, as an at-
torney is an officer of the court, and he is presumed to
plead after having obtained leave, which admits the juris-
diction. Lawes, PI. 91.
In some jurisdictions, however, this rule is no longer rec-
ognized. 1 C.J. 255.

## IN QUO QUIS DELINQUIT, IN EO DE JURE EST PUNIENDUS

In whatever thing one of-
fends, in that is he rightfully to be punished. Co.
Litt. 233b; Wing. Max. 204, max. 58. The punish-
ment shall have relation to the nature of the of-
fense.

## IN RE

In the affair; in the matter of; concern-
ing; re. This is the usual method of entitling a
judicial proceeding in which there are not adver-
sary parties, but merely some res concerning
which judicial action is to be taken, such as a
bankrupt's estate, an estate in the probate court,
a proposed public highway, etc. It is also some-
times used as a designation of a proceeding where
one party makes an application on his own be-
half, but such proceedings are more usually enti-
tled "Ex parte ."

## IN RE COMMUNI MELIOR EST CONDITIO PROHIBENTIS

In common property the con-
dition of the one prohibiting is the better. In oth-
er words, either co-owner has a right of veto
against the acts of the other. Gulf Refining Co.
of Louisiana v. Carroll, 145 La. 299, 82 So. 277, 279.
IN RE COMMUNI NEMINEM DOMINORUM
JURE FACERE QUICQUAM, INVITO ALTERO,
POSSE. One co-proprietor can exercise no au-
thority over the common property against the will
of the other. Dig. 10, 3, 28. In other words, eith-
er co-owner has a right of veto against the acts
of the other. Gulf Refining Co. of Louisiana v.
Carroll, 145 La. 299, 82 So. 277, 279.

## IN RE COMMUNI POTIOR EST CONDITIO PRO- HIBENTIS

In a partnership the condition of one
who forbids is the more favorable.
IN RE DUBIA, BENIGNIOREM INTERPRETA-
TIONEM SEQUI, NON MINUS JUSTIUS EST
QUAM TUTIUS. In a doubtful matter, to follow
the more liberal interpretation is not less the
juster than the safer course. Dig. 50, 17, 192, 1.

## IN RE DUBIA, MAGIS INFICIATIO QUAM AF- FIRMATIO INTELLIGENDA

In a doubtful mat-
ter, the denial or negative is to be understood, [or
regarded,] rather than the affirmative. Godb. 37.
IN RE LUPANARI, TESTES LUPANARES AD-
MITTENT1UR. In a matter concerning a brothel,
prostitutes are admitted as witnesses. Van Epps
v. Van Epps, 6 Barb. (N.Y.) 320, 324.

## IN RE PARI POTIOREM CAUSAM ESSE PRO- HIBENTIS CONSTAT

In a thing equally shar-
ed [by several] it is clear that the party refusing
[to permit the use of it] has the better cause.
Dig. 10, 3, 28. A maxim applied to partnerships,
where one partner has a right to withhold his as-
sent to the acts of his copartner. 3 Kent.Comm.
IN RE PROPRIA INIQUUM ADMODUM EST AL-
ICUI LICENTIAM TRIBUERE SENTENTIJE.
It is extremely unjust that any one should be
judge in his own cause.
IN REBUS (Lat.) In things, cases, or matters.
IN REBUS MANIFESTIS, ERRAT QUI AUC-
TORITATES LEGUM ALLEGAT; QUIA PER-
SPICUA VERA NON SUNT PROBANDA. In
clear cases, he mistakes who cites legal authori-
ties; for obvious truths are not to be proved. 5
Coke, 67a. Applied to cases too plain to require
the support of authority; "because," says the re-
port, "he who endeavors to prove them obscures
them."
IN REBUS QU1E SUNT FAVORABILIA ANIMA,
QUAMVIS SUNT DAMNOSA REBUS, FIAT ALI-
QUANDO EXTENSIO STATUTI. 10 Coke, 101.
In things that are favorable to the spirit, though
injurious to things, an extension of a statute
should sometimes be made.

## IN REGARD TO

Concerning; relating to; in
respect of; with respect to; about. Hart v. Hart,
181 Iowa 527, 164 N.W. 849, 850.

## IN REM

A technical term used to designate pro-
ceedings or actions instituted against the thing,
in contradistinction to personal actions, which are
said to be in personam. See In Personam.
It is true that, In a strict sense, a proceeding in rem is
one taken directly against property, and has for its object
the disposition of property, without reference to the title
of individual claimants; but, in a larger and more general
sense, the terms are applied to actions between parties,
where the direct object is to reach and dispose of property
owned by them, or of some interest therein. Such are
cases commenced by attachment against the property of
debtors, or instituted to partition real estate, foreclose a
mortgage, or enforce a lien. So far as they affect property
in this state, they are substantially proceedings in rem In
the broader sense which we have mentioned. Pennoyer v.
Neff, 95 U.S. 734, 24 L. Ed. 565; Continental Gin Co. v.
Arnold, 66 Oki. 132, 167 P. 613, 617, L.R.A.1918B, 511.
In the strict sense of the term, a proceeding "In rem" is
one which is taken directly against property or one which
is brought to enforce a right in the thing itself. Austin
v. Royal League, 316 Ill. 188, 147 N.E. 106, 109.
A divorce suit is a "suit in rem," the essential character-
istic of which is found in the power of the state through
the decree or judgment of its court to dispose of the sub-
ject-matter of the suit, the res, in accordance with the ob-
ject of the suit, whether that subject-matter be physical
property or the status of one or both of the parties litigant,
which decree operates immediately and absolutely upoh
the status of the suitor which is the res in the suit with-
out the necessity of execution, attachment, or contempt
proceedings to enforce it. Lister v. Lister, 86 N.J.Eq. 30,
97 A. 170, 173.
A proceeding "in rem" is in effect a proceeding against
the owner, as well as a proceeding against the goods, for it
is his breach of the law which has to be proven to estab-
lish the forfeiture, and it is his property which is sought
to be forfeited. Mack v. Westbrook, 148 Ga. 690, 98 S.E.
339, 343.
Judgment in rem. See that title.
Quasi in rem. A term applied to proceedings
which are not strictly and purely in rem, but are
brought against the defendant personally, though
the real object is to deal with particular property
or subject property to the discharge of claims as-
serted; for example, foreign attachment, or pro-
ceedings to foreclose a mortgage, remove a cloud
from title, or effect a partition. Freeman v. Al-
derson, 7 S.Ct. 165, 119 U.S. 187, 30 L.Ed. 372; Hill
v. Henry, 66 N.J.Eq. 150, 57 A. 555.
IN REM ACTIO EST PER QUAM REM NOS-
TRAM QUIE AB ALIO POSSIDETUR PETIMUS,
ET SEMPER ADVERSUS EUM EST QUI REM
POSSIDET. The action in rem is that by which
we seek our property which is possessed by an-
other, and is always against him who possesses
the property. Dig. 44, 7, 25; Bract. fol. 102.

## IN RENDER

A thing is said to lie in render
when it must be rendered or given by the tenant;
as rent. It is said to lie in prender when it con-
sists in the right in the lord or other person to
take something. See In Prender.

## IN REPUBLICA MAXIME CONSERVANDA SUNT JURA BELLI

In a state the laws of war
are to be especially upheld. 2 Inst. 58.

## IN RERUM NATURA

In the nature of things;
in the realm of actuality; in existence. In a dila-
tory plea, an allegation that the plaintiff is not
in rerum natura is equivalent to averring that the
person named is fictitious. 3 Bl.Comm. 301.
In civil law, this phrase is applied to things.
Inst. 2, 20, 7. It is a broader term than in rebus
humanis: g. before quickening, an infant is in
rerum natura, but not in rebus humanis; after
quickening, he is in rebus humanis as well as in
rerum natura. Calvinus, Lex.

## IN RESTITUTIONEM, NON IN PCENAM HIER- ES SUCCEDIT

The heir succeeds to the restitu-
tion, not to the penalty. An heir may be compel-
led to make restitution of a sum unlawfully appro-
priated by the ancestor, but is not answerable
criminally, as for a penalty. 2 Inst. 198.

## IN RESTITUTIONIBUS BENIGNISSIMA INTER- PRETATIO FACIENDA EST

Co.Litt. 112. The
most benignant interpretation is to be made in
restitutions.
IN SATISFACTIONIBUS NON PERMITTITUR
AMPLIUS FIERI QUAM SEMEL FACTUM EST.
In payments, more must not be received than has
been received once for all. 9 Coke, 53.

## IN SCRINIO JUDICIS

In the writing-case of the
judge; among the judge's papers. "That is a
thing that rests in scrinio judicis, and does not ap-
pear in the body of the decree." Hardr. 51.

## IN SEPARALI

In several; in severalty. Fleta,
lib. 2, c. 54, § 20.

## IN SIMILI MATERIA

Dealing with the same or
a kindred subject-matter.

## IN SIMPLICI PEREGRINATIONE

In simple
pilgrimage. Bract. fol. 338. A phrase in the old
law of essoins. See In Generali Passagio.

## IN SOLIDO

In the civil law. For the whole;
as a whole. An obligation in solido is one where
each of the several obligors is liable for the whole;
that is, it is joint and several. Henderson v.
Wadsworth, 6 S.Ct. 140, 115 U.S. 264, 29 L.Ed.
377. Possession in solidum is exclusive posses-
sion.
When several persons obligate themselves to the obligee
by the terms "in solido," or use any other expressions
which clearly show that they intend that each one shall be
separately bound to perform the whole of the obligation,
it is called an "obligation in solido" on the part of the ob-
ligors. Civ.Code La. art. 2082.

## IN SOLIDUM

For the whole. Si plures sint
fide jussores, quotquot erunt numero, singuli in
solidum tenentur, if there be several sureties,
however numerous they may be, they are indivi-
dually bound for the whole debt. Inst. 3, 21, 4.
In parte sive in solidum, for a part or for the
whole. Id. 4, 1, 16. See Id. 4, 6, 20; Id. 4, 7, 2.

## IN SOLO

in another's ground. In solo proprio, in one's
own ground. 2 Steph.Comm. 20.

## IN SPECIE

Specific; specifically. Thus, to de-
cree performance in specie is to decree specific
performance. In kind; in the same or like form.
A thing is said to exist in specie when it retains
its existence as a distinct individual of a particu-
lar class.

## IN STATU QUO

In the condition in which it
was. See Status Quo. McReynolds v. Harrigfeld,
26 Idaho 26, 140 P. 1096, 1098.
IN STIPULATIONIBUS CUM QUIERITUR QUID
ACTUM SIT VERBA CONTRA STIPULATOREM
INTERPRETANDA SUNT. In the construction
of agreements words are interpreted against the
person using them. Thus, the construction of the
stipulatio is against the stipulator, and the con-
struction of the promissio against the promissor.
Dig. 45, 1, 38, 18; Broom, Max. 599.

## IN STIPULATIONIBUS, ID TEMPUS SPECTA- TOR QUO CONTRAHIMUS

In stipulations, the
time when we contract is regarded. Dig. 50, 17,
144, 1.

dictments for riots. 4 Car. & P. 373.

## IN TESTAMENTIS PLENIUS TESTATORIS IN- TENTIONEM SCRUTAMUR

In wills we more
especially seek out the intention of the testator.
3 Bulst. 103; Broom, Max. 555.

## IN TESTAMENTIS PLENIUS VOLUNTATES TESTANTIUM INTERPRETANTUR

Dig. 50, 17,
12. In wills the intention of testators is more es-
pecially regarded. "That is to say," says Mr.
Broom, (Max., 568,) "a will will receive a more
liberal construction than its strict meaning, if
alone considered, would permit."
IN TESTAMENTIS RATIO TACITA NON DE-
BET CONSIDERARI, SED VERBA SOLUM
SPECTARI DEBENT; ADEO PER DIVINATION-
EM MENTIS A VERB'S RECEDERE DURUM
EST. In wills an unexpressed meaning ought not
to be considered, but the words alone ought to be
looked to; so hard is it to recede from the words
by guessing at the intention.

dence whereof.

## IN THE PEACE OF THE STATE

In definition
of murder as unlawful and felonious killing of hu-
man being "in the peace of the state," the quoted
phrase means the same as "in the king's peace"

idea that deceased was actually engaged in wag-
ing war against the state. State v. Corneille, 153
La. 929, 96 So. 813, 817.

## IN TOTIDEM VERBIS

In so many words; in
precisely the same words; word for word.

is said, but what is done, is looked to. 9 Coke,

quantity, unless he agree for a certain quantity,
Bean v. Parker, 17 Mass. 597.

## IN VERBIS, NON VERBA, SED RES ET RATIO, QUIERENDA EST

Jenk. Cent. 132. In the con-
struction of words, not the mere words, but the
thing and the meaning, are to be inquired after.

## IN VINCULIS

In chains; in actual custody.
Gilb. Forum Rom. 97.
Applied also, figuratively, to the condition of a

## INADEQUATE REMEDY AT LAW

Within the
meaning of the rule that equity will not entertain
a suit if there is an adequate remedy at law, this
does not mean that there must be a failure to col-
lect money or damages at law, but the remedy is
considered inadequate if it is, in its nature and
character, unfitted or not adapted to the end in
view, as, for instance, when the relief sought is
preventive rather than compensatory. Cruick-
shank v. Bidwell, 20 S.Ct. 280, 176 U.S. 73, 44 L.
Ed. 377.
lished rules of law, cannot be admitted or receiv-

to the priesthood, after the augurs had been con-
sulted.

## INBLAURA

In old records. Profit or product of
ground. Cowell.

## INBOARD

In maritime law, and particularly
with reference to the stowage of cargo, this term
is contrasted with "outboard." It does not neces-
sarily mean under deck, but is applied to a cargo
so piled or stowed that it does not project over
the "board" (side or rail) of the vessel. Allen v.
St. Louis Ins. Co., 46 N.Y.Super.Ct. 181.

## INBORH

Incorporated. Goldberg, Bowen & Co. v.
Dimick, 169 Cal. 187, 146 P. 672, 673; Norwood
Bldg. v. Jackson, • Tex.Civ.App., 175 S.W.2d 262,
INCAPACITY. Want of capacity; want of pow-
er or ability to take or dispose; want of legal abil-
ity to act. Ellicott v. Ellicott, 90 Md. 321, 45 A.
183, 48 L.R.A. 58. Inefficiency; incompetency;
lack of adequate power. Travelers' Ins. Co. v.
Richmond, Tex.Com.App., 291 S.W. 1085, 1087.
This expression implies that the person in view has the
right vested in him, but is prevented by some impediment
from exercising it; as in the case of minors, femes covert,
lunatics, etc. An administrator has no right until letters
are issued to him. Therefore he cannot benefit (as respects
the time before obtaining letters) by a saving clause in a
statute of limitations in favor of persons under a legal in-
capacity to sue. Cates v. Brattle, 1 Root (Conn.) 187.
Total incapacity
In Workmen's Compensation Acts, such disqualification
from performing the usual tasks of a workman that he can-
not procure and retain employment. Western Indemnity
Co. v. Corder, Tex.Civ.App., 249 S.W. 316, 317; Georgia
Casualty Co. v. Ginn, Tex.Civ.App., 272 S.W. 601, 603;
Moore v. Peet Bros. Mfg. Co., 99 Kan. 443, 162 P. 295, 296.
Incapacity for work is total not only so long as the
injured employee is unable to do any work of any char-
acter, but also while he remains unable, as a result of his
injury, either to resume his former occupation or to pro-
cure remunerative employment at a different occupation
suitable to his impaired capacity. Such period of total in-
capacity may be followed by a period of partial incapacity,
during which the injured employee is able both to procure
and to perform work at some occupation suitable to his
then-existing capacity, but less remunerative than the work
in which he was engaged at the time of his injury. That
situation constitutes "partial incapacity." Austin Bros.
Bridge Co. v. Whitmire, 121 S.E. 345, 346, 31 Ga.App. 560.
Synonymous with "total disability." Consolidation Coal
Co. v. Crislip, 289 S.W. 270, 273, 217 Ky. 371. See Disabili-
ty.

## INCARCERATION

Imprisonment; confinement
in a jail or penitentiary. See Imprisonment.
This term is seldom used in law, though found occasion-
ally in statutes. When so used, it appears always to mean
confinement by competent public authority or under due
legal process, whereas "imprisonment" may be effected by
a private person without warrant of law. and if unjustifi-
able is called "false imprisonment." No occurrence of
such a phrase as "false incarceration" has been noted.

INCAUSTUM, or ENCAUSTUM. Ink. Fleta, 1,
2, c. 27, § 5.

tions of sale, are published. When the sale takes
place, a small piece of candle, about an inch long
is kept burning, and the last bidder, when the
candle goes out, is entitled to the lot or parcel for
which he bids. Wharton.
Inch of water. The unit for the measure-
ment of a volume of water or of hydraulic power,

husband in deed, which operates as release or satisfaction
of interest and not as conveyance. Auerbach v. Chase Nat.
Bank of City of New York, 296 N.Y.S. 487, 489, 251 App.
Div. 543.

## INCHOATE INSTRUMENT

Instruments which
the law requires to be registered or recorded are
said to be "inchoate" prior to registration, in that

as a noun, it denotes anything which inseparably
belongs to, or is connected with, or inherent in,
another thing, called the "principal." In this sense,
a court-baron is incident to a manor. Also, less
strictly, it denotes anything which is usually con-
nected with another, or connected for some pur-
poses, though not inseparably. Thus, the right of
alienation is incident to an estate in fee-simple,
though separable in equity. Cromwell v. Phipps,
Sur., 1 N.Y.S. 278; Mount Carmel Fruit Co. v.

istence, means such powers as -are directly and immediately
appropriate to the execution of the powers expressly grant-
ed and exist only to enable the corporation to carry out
the purpose of its creation. State ex inf. Harvey v. Mis-
souri Athletic Club, 261 Mo. 576, 170 S. W. 904, 909, L.R.A.
1915C, 876, Ann.Cas.1916D, 931; State ex rel. Barrett v.

prehending the stated limits or extremes. Oppos-
ed to "exclusive."

-v. Morris, 19 S.E. 531, 39 W.Va. 432.

## INCOLA

Lat. In the civil law. An inhabitant;
.a dweller or resident. Properly, one who has
transferred his domicile to any country.

## INCOLAS DOMICILIUM FACIT

Residence
creates domicile. Arnold v. United Ins. Co., 1
Johns. Cas., N.Y., 363, 366.

## INCOME

The return in money from one's busi-
ness, labor, or capital invested; gains, profits, or
private revenue. In re Slocum, 169 N.Y. 153, 62
N.E. 130.
The gain derived from capital, from labor or effort, or
both combined, including profit or gain through sale or
conversion of capital ; income is not a gain accruing to
capital or a growth in the value of the investment, but is
a gain, a profit, something of exchangeable value, proceed-
ing from the property, severed from the capital, however
invested or employed, and coming in, being derived, that
is, received or drawn by the recipient for his separate use,
benefit, and disposal. Goodrich v. Edwards, 41 S.Ct. 390,
255 U.S. 527, 65 L.Ed. 758. The true increase in amount
of wealth which comes to a person during a stated period
of time. Commissioner of Corporations and Taxation v.
Filoon, 310 Mass. 374, 38 N.E.2d 693, 700.

## INCOME TAX

A tax relating to the product or
income from property or from business pursuits;
a tax on the yearly profits arising from property,
professions, trades, or offices; a tax on a person's
income, emoluments, profits, and the like, or the
excess thereof over a certain amount. Interstate
Bond Co. v. State Revenue Commission of Georgia,
50 Ga.App. 744, 179 S.E. 559.
An income tax is not levied upon property, funds, or
profits, but upon the right of an individual or corporation
to receive income or profits. Paine v. City of Oshkosh, 190
Wis. 69, 208 N.W. 790, 791. Under various constitutional
and statutory provisions, a tax on incomes is sometimes
said to be an excise tax and not a tax on property, Hatties-
burg Grocery Co. v. Robertson, 126 Miss. 34, 88 So. 4, 5,
25 A.L.R. 748; nor on business, but a tax on the proceeds
arising therefrom, Young v. Illinois Athletic Club, 310 Ill.
75, 141 N.E. 369, 371, 30 A.L.R. 985. But in other cases an
income tax is said to be a property and not a personal or
excise tax: Commonwealth v. P. Horillard Co., 129 Va. 74,
105 S.E. 683, 684; Kennedy v. Commissioner of Corpora-
tions & Taxation, 256 Mass. 426, 152 N.E. 747, 748.
An "excise tax" is an indirect charge for the privilege
of following an occupation or trade, or carrying on a busi-
ness; while an "income tax" is a direct tax imposed upon
income, and is as directly imposed as is a tax on land.
United States v. Philadelphia, B. & W. R. Co., D.C.Pa., 262
F. 188, 190.

## INCOME TAX DEFICIENCY

Exists whenever
taxpayer has failed to make adequate return of
income, notwithstanding lack of determination by
commissioner or his agents. Moore v. Cleveland
INCOMMODUM NON SOLVIT ARGUMENTUM.
An inconvenience does not destroy an argument.

## INCOMMUNICATION

In Spanish law. The
condition of a prisoner who is not permitted to
see or to speak with any person visiting him dur-
ing his confinement. A person accused cannot be
subjected to this treatment unless it be expressly
ordered by the judge, for some grave offense, and
it cannot be continued for a longer period than is
absolutely necessary. This precaution is resorted
to for the purpose of preventing the accused from
knowing beforehand the testimony of the witness-
es, or from attempting to corrupt them and con-
cert such measures as will efface the traces of his
guilt. As soon, therefore, as the danger of his
doing so has ceased, the interdiction ceases like-
wise. Escriche.

## INCOMMUTABLE

Not capable of or entitled to
be commuted. See Commutation.

## INCOMPATIBILITY

Incapability of existing or
being exercised together.
Thus the relations of landlord and of tenant cannot exist
in one man at the same time in reference to the same land.
"Incompatibility" which at common law operates to vacate
one office by reason of incumbency of another exists when
the character and nature of offices or relation to each other
are such that one person should not hold both because of
the contrariety and antagonism which would result toward
incumbent of one office in attempt to discharge duties of
other office faithfully and impartially. It is apparent when
the holder of one office is subordinate to or has supervision
over the other, or has the power of appointment, removal,
or punishment of that other, or the audit of his accounts,
or the regulation of his compensation. State ex rel.
Schenck v. Barrett, 121 Conn. 237, 184 A. 379, 381.

## INCOMPATIBLE

Not compatible, incapable of
harmonizing or agreeing, mutually repelling, in-
congruous. And two or more relations, offices,
functions, or rights which cannot naturally, or may
not legally, exist in or be exercised by the same
person at the same time, are said to be incompati-
ble. People v. Green, 46 How.Prac., N.Y., 170;
Com. v. Sheriff, 4 Serg. & R. (Pa.) 276; State v.
Johnson, 37 N.M. 280, 21 P.2d 813, 89 A.L.R. 1368.
See, also, Incompatibility.

## INCOMPETENCY

Lack of ability, legal quali-
fication, or fitness to discharge the required duty.
In re Leonard's Estate, 95 Mich. 295, 54 N.W. 1082.
In New York, the word "incompetency" is used to desig-
nate the condition or legal status of a person who is unable
or unfitted to manage his own affairs by reason of insanity,
imbecility, or feeble-mindedness, and for whom, therefore,
a committee may be appointed; and such a person is desig-
nated and "incompetent." In re Palestine's Estate, 270 N.
Y.S. 844, 151 Misc. 100.
In French law. Inability or insufficiency of a
judge to try a cause brought before him, proceed-
ing from lack of jurisdiction.

## INCOMPETENT EVIDENCE

Evidence which is
not admissible under the established rules of evi-
dence; evidence which the law does not permit to
be presented at all, or in relation to the particular
matter, on account of lack of originality or of
some defect in the witness, the document, or the
nature of the evidence itself. Texas Brewing Co.
v. Dickey, Tex.Civ.App., 43 S.W. 578; Bell v.
As applied to evidence, the word "incompetent" means
not proper to be received; inadmissible, as distinguished
from that which the court should admit for the considera-
tion of the jury, though they may not find it worthy of
credence.

## INCONCLUSIVE

That which may be disproved
or rebutted; not shutting out further proof or
consideration. Applied to evidence and presump-
tions.

## INCONSISTENT

Mutually repugnant or contra-
dictory; contrary, the one to the other, so that
both cannot' stand, but the acceptance or establish-
ment of the one implies the abrogation or aban-
donment of the other; as, in speaking of "incon-
sistent defenses," or the repeal by a statute of
"all laws inconsistent herewith." Borough of
Oakland v. Board of Conservation and Develop-
ment, 98 N.J.L. 99, 118 A. 787, 788. Berry v. City
of Fort Worth, Tex.Civ.App., 110 S.W.2d 95, 103.

## INCONSULTO

Lat. In the civil law. Unadvis-
edly; unintentionally. Dig. 28, 4, 1.

## INCONTESTABILITY CLAUSE

In life policy
means that within the limits of the coverage, the
policy shall stand unaffected by any defense that
it was invalid in its inception or thereafter became
invalid by reason of a condition broken by insured.
Berkshire Life Ins. Co. v. Weinig, 290 N.Y. 6, 47
N.E.2d 418, 421. Jolley v. Jefferson Standard Life
Ins. Co., 199 N.C. 269, 154 S.E. 400, 402.

in unlawful carnal connection. State v. Hewlin,
128 N.C. 571, 37 S.E. 952.
INCONTINENT!. See In Continenti.

## INCONVENIENCE

In the rule that statutes
should be so construed as to avoid "inconveni-
ence," this means, as applied to the public, the sac-
rifice or jeoparding of important public interests
or hampering the legitimate activities of govern-
ment or the transaction of public business, and,
as applied to individuals, serious hardship or in-
justice. Black, Interp.Laws, 102; Betts v. U. S.,
C.C.A.Mass., 132 F. 237, 65 C.C.A. 452.

an alphabetical roll of solicitors; to issue certifi-
cates to persons duly admitted and enrolled, and
to exercise a general control over the conduct of
solicitors in practice, and to bring cases of mis-
conduct before the judges. 3 Steph. Corn. 217.

## INCORPORATION

The act or process of form-
ing or creating a corporation; the formation of
a legal or political body, with the quality of per-
petual existence and succession, unless limited by
the act of incorporation. Abbott v. Limited Mut.
Compensation Ins. Co., 30 Cal.App.2d 157, 85 P.2d
961, 964.
The method of making one document of any
kind become a part of another separate document
by referring to the former in the latter, and de-
claring that the former shall be taken and con-
sidered as a part of the latter the same as if it
were fully set out therein. This is more fully
described as "incorporation by reference." If the
one document is copied at length in the other, it
is called "actual incorporation."
In the civil law. The union of one domain to
another.

## INCORPOREAL

Incapable of being corrected,
amended, or improved; with respect to juvenile

## INCREASE, COSTS OF

In English law. It was
formerly a practice with the jury to award to the
successful party in an action the nominal sum of
40s. only for his costs; and the court assessed by
their own officer the actual amount of the success-
ful party's costs; and the amount so assessed,
over and above the nominal sum awarded by the
jury, was thence called "costs of increase." Lush,
Com. Law Pr. 775. The practice has now wholly
ceased. Rapal. & Law.

## INCREMENT

An increasing, growth in bulk,
quantity, number, value, etc.; enlargement, in-
crease. That which is gained or added; the act
or process of increasing, augmenting, or growing;

Lat. Increase or improve-
ment, opposed to decrementum or abatement.

ject to a charge or liability; e. g., by mortgaging
it. Incumbrances include not only mortgages and

dentes, registered judgments, and writs of execu-
tion, etc. Sweet; Newhall v. Insurance Co., 52
Me. 181.

## INDE

Lat. Thence; thenceforth; thereof;

## INDE DAVE LEGES NE FORTIOR OMNIA POS- SET

Laws are made to prevent the stronger
from having the power to do everything. Day. Ir.
K. B. 36.

Lat. Indebted. Nunquam in-
debitatus, never indebted. The title of the plea
substituted in England for nil debet.

## INDEBITATUS ASSUMPSIT

Lat. Being indebt-
ed, he promised or undertook. That form of the
action of assumpsit in which the declaration al-
leges a debt or obligation to be due from the de-
fendant, and then avers that, in consideration
thereof, he promised to pay or discharge the same.
This form of action is brought to recover in damages the
amount of the debt or demand and upon the trial the jury
will, according to evidence, give verdict for whole or part
of that sum; 3 Bla.Com. 155; Selw.N.P. 68; whereas
debt and covenant proceed directly for the debt, and dam-
ages are given only for the detention of the debt.

## INDEBITI SOLUTIO

Lat. In the civil and
Scotch law. A payment of what is not due. When
made through ignorance or by mistake, the
amount paid might be recovered back by an ac-
tion termed "conditio indebiti." (Dig. 12, 6.) Bell.

## INDEBITUM

In the civil law. Not due or owing.
(Dig. 12, 6.) Calvin.

## INDEBTEDNESS

The state of being in debt,
without regard to the ability or inability of the
party to pay the same. 1 Story, Eq. Jur. 343;
Jewell v. Nuhn, 173 Iowa 112, 155 N.W. 174, 177,
Ann.Cas.1918D, 356. The owing of a sum of mon-
ey upon a certain and express agreement. City
of Perry v. Johnson, 233 P. 679, 680, 106 Okl. 32.
Strictly the word implies an absolute or complete lia-
.
binity. McCrea v. First Nat. Bank, 162 Minn. 455, 203 N.W.
220; West Florida Grocery Co. v. Teutonia Fire Ins. Co., 74
Fla. 220, 77 So. 209, 211, L.R.A.1918B, 968. A contingent
liability, such as that of a surety before the principal has
made default, does not constitute indebtedness. On the
other hand, the money need not be immediately payable.
Obligations yet to become due constitute indebtedness, as
well as those already due. St. Louis Perpetual Ins. Co. v.
Goodfellow, 9 Mo. 149. And in a broad sense and in com-
mon understanding the word may mean anything that is
due and owing. Jones v. Heinzle, 75 Ind.App. 431, 130 N.E.
815, 816.
Involuntary indebtedness. Of a county, a lia-
bility imposed by law, which the county is not
privileged to evade or postpone. Dexter Horton
Trust & Savings Bank v. Clearwater County, D.C.
Idaho, 235 F. 743, 756; Wingate v. Clatsop Coun-
ty, 71 Or. 94, 142 P. 561, 562.
Voluntary indebtedness. One which a county
Is at liberty to evade or postpone until means
are provided for the payment of the expenses in-
cident thereto; opposed to involuntary indebted-
ness. Wingate v. Clatsop County, 71 Or. 94, 142
P. 561, 562.

## INDECENCY

An act against good behavior and
a just delicacy. Timmons v. U. S., C.C.A.Ohio,
85 F. 205, 30 C.C.A. 74.
This is scarcely a technical term of the law, and is not
susceptible of exact definition or description in its juridical
uses. The question whether or not a given act, publica-
tion, etc., is indecent is for the court and jury in the par-
ticular case.

## INDECENT

Offensive to common propriety; of-
fending against modesty or delicacy; grossly
vulgar; obscene; lewd; unseemly; unbecoming;
indecorous; unfit to be seen or heard. Hutcheson
v. State, 24 Ga.App. 54, 99 S.E. 715; Wood v. State,
45 Ga.App. 783, 165 S.E. 908.
Indecent assault. The act of a male person
taking indecent liberties with the person of a
female. Martin v. Jansen, 113 Wash. 290, 193 P.
674, 675; Commonwealth v. Gregory, 132 Pa.Super.
507, 1 A.2d 501, without her consent and against
her will, but with no intent to commit the crime
of rape.
Indecent exhibition. Any exhibition contra
bonos mores, as the taking a dead body for the
purpose of dissection or public exhibition. 2 T.R.
Indecent exposure. Exposure to sight of the
private parts of the body in a lewd or indecent
manner in a public place. It is an indictable of-
fense at common law, and by statute in many of
the states. Commonwealth v. Broadland, 315
Mass. 20, 51 N.E.2d 961, 962. See, further, Ex-
posure of Person.
Indecent liberties. In the statutory offense of
"taking indecent liberties with the person of a
female child," this phrase means such liberties as
the common sense of society would regard as in-
decent and improper. According to some author-
ities, it involves an assault or attempt at sexual
intercourse, (State v. Kunz, 90 Minn. 526, 97 N.
W. 131,) but according to others, it is not neces-
sary that the liberties or familiarities should have
related to the private parts of the child, (People v.
Hicks, 98 Mich. 86, 56 N.W. 1102.)
Indecent publications. Such as are offensive to
modesty and delicacy; obscene; lewd; tending to
the corruption of morals. Dunlop v. U. S., 17 S.
Ct. 375, 165 U.S. 486, 41 L.Ed. 799.
Public indecency. This phrase has no fixed le-
gal meaning, is vague and indefinite, and cannot,
in itself, imply a definite offense. The courts, by
a kind of judicial legislation, in England and the
United States, have usually limited the operation
of the term to public displays of the naked person,
the publication, sale, or exhibition of obscene
books and prints, or the exhibition of a monster,

against loss or damage; to give security for the
reimbursement of a person in case of an anticipat-
ed loss falling upon him. Hasbrouck v. Carr, 19
N.M. 586, 145 P. 133, 136.
To make good; to compensate; to make reim-
bursement to one of a loss already incurred by

being damnified by the legal consequences ot an
act or forbearance on the part of one of the par-
ties or of some third person. National Bank of
Tifton v. Smith, 142 Ga. 663, 83 S.E. 526, 528, L.
R.A.1915B, 1116.
The term is also used to denote a compensa-
tion given to make the person whole from a loss
already sustained; as where the government gives
indemnity for private property taken by it for
public use. Proctor v. Dillon, 235 Mass. 538, 129
N.E. 265, 269. It means, also, restitution or reim-
bursement. Travelers Ins. Co. v. Georgia Power
Co., 51 Ga.App. 579, 181 S.E. 111.
A legislative act, assuring a general dispensa-
tion from punishment or exemption from prosecu-
tion to persons involved in offenses, omissions of
official duty, or acts in excess of authority, is call-
ed an indemnity; strictly it is an act of indemnity.
Loss. See Loss.
Thus, insurance is a contract of indemnity. So an
indemnifying bond is given to a sheriff who fears to pro-
ceed under an execution where the property is claimed by a
stranger.

## INDEMNITY AGAINST LIABILITY

A con-
tract to indemnify when liability of person indem-
nified arises, irrespective of.whether person indem-
nified has suffered actual loss. Indemnity against
loss, on the other hand, does not render indemnitor

sustains loss. City of Topeka v. Ritchie, 102 Kan.
384, 170 P. 1003, 1004.

to him such pecuniary damage as he may suffer.
See Wicker v. Hoppock, 6 Wall. 99, 18 L.Ed. 752.

## INDEMNITY LANDS

roads, in aid of their construction, being portions
of the public domain, to be selected in lieu of other
parcels embraced within the original grant, but
which were lost to the railroad by previous dis-
position or by reservation for other purposes.
Altschul v. Clark, 39 Or. 315, 65 P. 991.

## INDEMNITY POLICY

As distinguished from
general liability policy, a policy on which no action
can be maintained except to indemnify for money
actually paid. Most v. Massachusetts Bonding &
Ins. Mo.App., 196 S.W. 1064, 1065.
See Indemnity insurance and Liability insurance
under Insurance.

## INDEMPNIS

The old form of writing indemnis.
Townsh. Pl. 19. So, indempnificatus for indemni-
ficatus.

## INDENIZATION

The act of making a denizen,
or of naturalizing.

## INDENT

In American law. A certificate or
indented certificate issued by the government of
the United States at the close of the Revolution,
Webster; U. S. v. Irwin, 26 Fed.Cas. 546.

## INDENT

To cut in a serrated or waiving line.
In old conveyancing, if a deed was made by more
parties than one, it was usual to make as many
copies of it as there were parties, and each was
cut or indented (either in acute angles, like the
teeth of a saw, or in a waving line) at the top or
side, to tally or correspond with the others, and
the deed so made was called an "indenture." An-
ciently, both parts were written on the same piece
of parchment, with some word or letters written
between them through which the parchment was
cut, but afterwards, the word or letters being
omitted, indenting came into use, the idea of which
was that the genuineness of each part might be
proved by its fitting into the angles cut in the
other. But at length even this was discontinued,
and at present the term serves only, to give name
to the species of deed executed by; two or more
parties, as opposed to a deed-poll (q. v.) 2 Bl.
Comm, 295.
To bind by indentures; to apprentice; as to in-
dent a young man to a shoe-maker. Webster.

## INDENTURE

A deed to which two or more per-
sons are parties, and in which these enter into
reciprocal and corresponding grants or obligations
towards each other; whereas a deed-poll is prop-
erly one in which only the party making it exe-
cutes it, or binds himself by it as a deed, though
the grantors or grantees therein may be several
in number. 3 Washb, Real Prop. 311, See In-
dent, v.

## INDENTURE OF A FINE

Indentures made and
engrossed at the chirographer's office and deliv-
ered to the cognizor and the cognizee, usually be-
ginning with the words: "Hcec est finalis con-
cordia." And then reciting the whole proceed-
ings at length. 2 Bla, Corn. 351.

## INDENTURE OF APPRENTICESHIP

tract in two parts, by which a person, generally
a minor, is bound to serve another in his trade,
art, or occupation for a stated time, on condition
of being instructed in the same.

## INDEPENDENCE

ing free from dependence, subjection, or control.

exterior power.

## INDEPENDENT

control, restriction, modification, or limitation
from a given outside source.

## INDEPENDENT ADJUSTER

corporation who holds himself or itself out for
employment to more than one insurance company,
is not a regular employee of the company, does
not work exclusively for one company and is paid
in each case assigned for time consumed and ex-
penses incurred. Cole v. State, 37 N.Y.S.2d 1002,
1006, 179 Misc. 172.
deed or will which must be shown where a fidu-
ciary relationship exists, means that the donor had
the preliminary benefit of conferring fully and pri-
vately upon the subject of his intended gift with a
person who was not oniv competent to inform him
t
correctly as to its legal effect, but who was, fur-
thermore, so disassociated from the interests of
the donee as to be in a position to advise with
the donor impartially and confidentially as to the
consequences to himself of his proposed benefac-
tion. Madden v. Glathart, 125 Kan. 466, 265 P. 42,
INDEPENDENT CONTRACT, See Contract.

## INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR

One who, exer-
cising an independent employment, contracts to
do a piece of work according to his own methods
and without being subject to the control of his
employer except as to the result of the work. Peo-
ple v. Orange County Road Const, Co., 175 N.Y.
84, 67 N.E. 129, 65 L.R.A. 33. Fox v. Dunning,
124 Okl. 228, 255 P. 582, 584; Bell v. State, 153 Md.
333, 138 A. 227, 228, 58 A.L.R. 1051.
One who exercises an independent employment and con-
tracts to do a piece of work according to his own judgment
and methods, and without being subject to his employer
except as to the results of the work, and who has the right
to employ and direct the action of the workmen, independ-
ently of such employer and freed from any superior author-
ity in him to say how the specified work shall be done, or
what the laborers shall do as it progresses. Johnson v.
Asheville Hosiery Co., 199 N.C. 38, 153 S.E. 591, 593. It is
very generally held that the right of control as to the mode
of doing the work contracted for is the principal considera-
tion in determining whether one employed is an "independ-
ent contractor" or servant. Thompson v. Twiss, 90 Conn.
444, 97 A. 328, 330, L.R.A.1916E, 506. If the employee is
merely subject to the control or direction of the employer
as to the result to be obtained, he is an independent con-
tractor ; if he is subject to the control of the employer as
to the means to be employed, he is not an independent con-
tractor. Gulf Refining Co. v. Wilkinson, 94 Fla. 664, 114
So. 503. Nettleship v. Shipman, 161 Wash. 292, 296 P. 1056,

cally arranged, to the contents of a series or col-
lection of volumes; or an addition to a single

nent of the intention. The language of a statute
or instrument is the best guide to the intention.
Broom, Max, 622,
INDIAN COUNTRY. As the term is used in the
federal statutes, is a country to which the Indians
retained the right of use and occupancy, involving
under certain restrictions freedom of action and of
enjoyment in their capacity as a distinct people,
and ceases to be such when their title is extin-
guished, unless by virtue of some reservation ex-
pressed at the time and clearly appearing. Schaap
v. United States, C.C.A.Ark., 210 F. 853, 855; Royal
Brewing Co. v. Missouri, K. & T. Ry. Co., D.C.Kan.,
211 F. 146, 148. This term does not necessarily im-
port territory owned and occupied by Indians, but
it means all those portions of the United States
designated by this name in the legislation of con-
gress. Waters v. Campbell, 4 Sawy. 121, Fed.Cas.
No.17,264.

## INDIAN DEPREDATIONS ACTS

As early as
May 19, 1796, an act was passed by congress, pro-
viding an eventual indemnification to citizens of
the United States for depredations committed by
Indians in taking or destroying their property;
1 St.L. 472. Other acts of a similar character were
passed from time to time. By the act of March 3,
1891, congress conferred on the court of claims ju-
risdiction of claims for property taken and de-
stroyed by Indians.

## INDIAN RESERVATION

A part of public do-
main set aside by proper authority for use and
occupation of tribe or tribes of Indians. Peters v.

D.C.N.C., 46 F.Supp. "843, 844.

## INDIAN TITLE

Claim of Indian tribes of right,
because of immemorial occupancy, to roam certain

INDICATION. In the law of evidence. A sign
or token; a fact pointing to some inference or
conclusion. Burrill, Circ. -EY. 251, 252, 263, 275.

## INDICATIVE EVIDENCE

This is not evidence
properly so called, but the mere suggestion of evi-
dence proper, which may possibly be procured if
the suggestion is followed up. Brown.
hibition that lies for a patron of a church, whose
clerk is sued in the spiritual court by the clerk
of another patron, for tithes amounting to a fourth
part of the value of the living. 3 Bl.Comm. 91;
3 Steph.Comm. 711. So termed from the emphatic
word of the Latin form. Reg.Orig. 35b, 36.

## IN DICTA

Signs; indications. Circumstances
which point to the existence of a given fact as
probable, but not certain. For example, "indicia of
partnership" are any circumstances which would
induce the belief that a given person was in reali-
ty, though not ostensibly, a member of a given
firm.
The term is much used in the civil law in a sense
nearly or entirely synonymous with circumstantial
evidence. It denotes facts which give rise to in-
ferences, rather than the inferences themselves.
Graham Ice Cream Co. v. Petros, 127 Neb. 172, 254
N.W. 869.

## INDICIUM

In the civil law. A sign or mark.
A species of proof, answering very nearly to the

cuted by process of indictment. Indictable offenses

Lakes v. Goodloe, 195 Ky, 240, 242 S.W. 632, 639.

## INDICTED

Charged in an indictment with a
criminal offense. See Indictment.

## INDICTEE

proclamation. Indictio belli, a declaration or in-
diction of war. An indictment.

## INDICTION, CYCLE OF

A mode of computing
time by the space of fifteen years, instituted by
Cbnstantine the Great; originally the period for

## INDICTMENT

An accusation in writing found
and presented by a grand jury, legally convoked
and sworn, to the court in which it is impaneled,
charging that a person therein named has done
some act, or been guilty of some omission, which,
by law, is a public offense, punishable on indict-
ment. Kennedy v. State, 86 Tex.Cr.R. 450, 216
S.W. 1086; State v. Engler, 217 Iowa 138, 251 N.W.
A presentment differs from an indictment in that it is an
accusation made by a grand jury of their own motion,
either upon their own observation and knowledge, or upon
evidence before them; while an indictment is preferred at
the suit of the government, and is usually framed in the
first instance by the prosecuting officer of the government,
and by him laid before, the grand jury, to be found or
ignored. An information resembles in its form and sub-
stance an indictment, but is filed at the mere discretion of
the proper law officer of the government, without the inter-
vention or approval of a grand jury, and an affidavit is a
charge made and preferred by an individual. 2 Story,
667, 670.
In Scotch law. The form of process by which
a criminal is brought to trial at the instance of the
lord advocate. Where a private party is a princi-
pal prosecutor, he brings his charge in what is
termed the "form of criminal letters."
Joint Indictment
When several offenders are joined in the same
indictment, as when principals in the first and
second degree, and accessaries before and after
the fact, are all joined in the same indictment. 2
Hale, P.C. 173; Brown.
INDICTMENT DE FELONY EST CONTRA PA-
CEM DOMINI REGIS, CORONAM ET DIGNITA-
TEM SUAM, IN GENERE ET NON IN INDI-
VIDUO; QUIA IN ANGLIA NON EST INTER-
REGNUM. Jenk. Cent. 205. Indictment for fel-
ony is against the peace of our lord the king, his
crown and dignity in general, and not against his
individual person; because in England there is
no interregnum.

## INDICTOR

He who causes another to be indicted.
The latter is sometimes called the "indictee."
INDIFFERENT. Impartial; unbiased; disinter-
ested. People v. Vermilyea, 7 Cow. (N.Y.) 122;
Fox v. Hills, 1 Conn. 307.

## INDIGENA

one born within the realm, or naturalized by act

342, 8 A. 141.

## INDIGENT INSANE PERSON

An insane per-
son with insufficient estate to pay for his mainte-
nance in the hospital, after providing for those
who could claim his support. Massachusetts Gen
eral Hospital v. Inhabitants of Belmont, 233 Mass.
190, 124 N.E. 21, 23.

## INDIGNITY

In the law of divorce, a species of
cruelty addressed to the mind, sensibilities, self-
respect, or personal honor of the subject, rather
than to the body, and defined as "unmerited con-
temptuous conduct towards another; any action
towards another which manifests contempt for
him; contumely, incivility, or injury accompanied
with insult." Goodman v. Goodman, 80 Mo.App.
281; 1 Bish. Mar. & Div. § 826; O'l-Tern v. O'Hern,
206 Mo.App. 651, 228 S.W. 533, 536.
The phrase "indignities to the person," as used in stat-
utes, has reference to bodily indignities, as distinguished
from such as may be offered to the mind, sensibilities, or
reputation. Kurtz v. Kurtz, 38 Ark. 123. But compare Mil-
ler v. Miller, 78 N.C. 105.

## INDIRECT

Not direct in relation or connection;
not having an immediate bearing or application;
ern & Southern Life Ins. Co., 48 Ohio App. 251,
192 N.E. 882, 883. Almost always used in law in
opposition to "direct," though not the only anti-
thesis of the latter word, as the terms "collateral"
and "cross" are sometimes used in contrast with
"direct"
As to indirect "Attack," "Confession," "Con-
tempt," and "Tax," see those titles.

## INDIRECT EVIDENCE

Is that which only tends
to establish the issue by proof of various facts
sustaining by their consistency the hypothesis
claimed. It consists of both inferences and pre-
sumptions. Lake County v. Neilon, 44 Or. 14, 74
P. 212, 214.
See, also, Circumstantial Evidence; Inference;
Presumption.

## INDIRECT TAX

A tax upon some right or priv-
ilege or corporate franchise. Madison Suburban
Utility Dist. of Davidson County v. Carson, 232
S.W.2d 277, 280, 191 Tenn. 300; a tax laid upon the
happening of an event as distinguished from its
tangible fruits. Chickering v. Commissioner of
Internal Revenue, C.C.A.1, 118 F.2d 254, 258.

## INDISPENSABLE

That which cannot be spared,
omitted, or dispensed with.

## INDISPENSABLE EVIDENCE

That without
which a particular fact cannot be proved. Ball-
inger's Ann. Codes & St. Or. 1901, § 689 (Code
1930, § 9-113).

## INDISPENSABLE PARTIES

In a suit in equity,
those who not only have an interest in the sub-
ject-matter of the controversy, but an interest of
such a nature that a final decree cannot be made
without either affecting their interests or leaving
the controversy in such a condition that its final de-
termination may be wholly inconsistent with equi-
ty and good conscience. Kendig v. Dean, 97 U.S.
425, 24 L.Ed. 1061. State of Washington v. United
States, C.C.A.Or. & Wash., 87 F.2d 421, 426, 427,
429, 431.

## INDIVIDUAL

As a noun, this term denotes a
single person as distinguished from a group or
class, and also, very commonly, a private or nat-
ural person as distinguished from a partnership,
corporation, or association; but it is said that
this restrictive signification is not necessarily in-
herent in the word, and that it may, in proper cas-
es, include artificialspersons. State v. Bell Tele-
phone Co., 36 Ohio St. 310, 38 Am.Rep. 583.
As an adjective, "individual" means pertaining
or belonging to, or characteristic of, one single
person, either in opposition to a firm, association,
or corporation, or considered in his relation there-
to.

## INDIVIDUAL SYSTEM OF LOCATION

A term
formerly used in Pennsylvania to designate the
location of public lands by surveys, in which the
land called for by each warrant was separately
surveyed. Ferguson v. Bloom, 144 Pa. 549, 23 A.

## INDIVIDUALLY

Separately and personally, as
distinguished from jointly or officially, and as
opposed to collective or associate action or com-
mon interest. Southern Distributing Co. v. Car-
raway, 189 N.C. 420, 127 S.E. 427, 428.

sons hold in common without partition; undivided.

## INDORSAT

In the law of negotiable instruments, a new and substan-
tive contract by which title to the instrument is transferred
and by which indorser becomes a party to the instrument
and is liable, on certain conditions for its payment. John-
son v. Beickey, 64 Utah, 43, 228 P. 189, 191. In this respect
indorsement differs from a common-law assignment. Jones
County Trust & Savings Bank v. Kurt, 192 Iowa, 965, 182
N.W. 409, 413.
One who writes his name upon a negotiable instrument,
otherwise than as a maker or acceptor, and delivers it, with
his name thereon, to another person, is called an "indors-
er," and his act is called "indorsement."
The word "indorsement" is also used with reference to
writs, insurance policies, certificates of stock, etc. The
term as used in the Uniform Stock Transfer Act contem-
plates a writing passing or attempting to pass title or an
interest. Stoltz v. Carroll, 99 Ohio St. 289, 124 N.E. 226,
231. As applied to a writ or warrant "indorsement" is an
entry made on the back thereof. Gondas Gondas, 99
N.J.Eq. 473, 134 A. 615, 617.
Accommodation indorsement
In the law of negotiable instruments, one made by a
third person without any consideration, but merely for the
benefit of the holder of the instrument, or to enable the
maker to obtain money or credit on it. Unless otherwise
explained, it is understood to be a loan of the indorser's
credit without restriction. Young v. Exchange Bank of
Kentucky, 152 Ky. 293, 153 S.W. 444, 445, Ann.Cas.1915B,
Blank indorsement
One made by the mere writing of the indorser's name on
the back of the note or bill, without mention of the name
of any person in whose favor the indorsement is made, but
with the implied understanding that any lawful holder may
fill in his own name above the indorsement if he so chooses.
Northern Trading Co. v. Drexel State Bank of Chicago, 37
N.D. 521, 164 N.W. 151, 154; Aufderheide v. Moeller, 221
Mo.App. 442, 281 S.W. 965, 967.
Conditional indorsement
One by which the indorser annexes some condition (other
than the failure of prior parties to pay) to his liability.
The condition may be either precedent or subsequent. 1
Daniel, Neg.Inst. 697.
Full indorsement
One by which the indorser orders the money to be paid
to some particular person by name; it differs from a blank
indorsement, which consists merely in the name of the
indorser written on the back of the instrument. Kilpatrick
v. Heaton, 3 Brev., S.C., 92; Lee v. Chillicothe Branch of
State Bank, 15 Fed.Cas. 153.
Irregular indorsement
One made by a third person before delivery of the note
to the payee; an indorsement in blank by a third person

Proper indorsement
Such indorsement as the law merchant requires to
authorize payment to the holder of the instrument. Secu-
rity State Bank v. State Bank of Brantford, N. D., 31 N.D.
454, 154 N.W. 282, 283.
Qualified indorsement
One which restrains or limits, or qualifies or enlarges,
the liability of the indorser, in any manner different from
what the law generally imports as his true liability, deduc-
ible from the nature of the instrument. Chitty, Bills, 261;
Stover Bank v. Welpman, Mo.App., 284 S.W. 177, 180. A
transfer of a bill of exchange or promissory note to an
usually employed for this purpose are "sans recours," with-
out recourse. 1 Bouv.Inst. No. 1138.
Regular indorsement
An indorsement in blank by a third person under the
name of the payee or after delivery of the note to him.
Bank of Bellows Falls v. Dorset Marble Co., 61 Vt. 106, 17
Atl. 42.
Restrictive indorsement
One which stops the negotiability of the instrument, or
which contains such a definite direction as to the payment
as to preclude the indorsee from making any further trans-
fer of the instrument. People's Bank v. Jefferson County
Say. Bank, 106 Ala. 524, 17 So. 728, 54 Am.St.Rep. 59.
Defined by statute in some states as an indorsement which
either prohibits the further negotiation of the instrument,
or constitutes the indorsee the agent of the indorser, or
vests the title in the indorsee in trust for or to the use of
some other person. Negotiable Instruments Law N. D. §
36 (Comp.Laws 1913, § 6921) ; Bates' Ann.St.Ohio 1904,
3172h (Gen.Code, § 8141).

An indorsement in full, which specifically names the
indorsee. Carolina Say. Bank v. Florence Tobacco Co., 45
S. C; 373, 23 S.E. 139.
Special indorsement of writ
In English practice. The writ of summons in an action
may, under Order iii. 6, be indorsed with the particulars
of the amount sought to be recovered in the action, after
giving credit for any payment or set-off ; and this special
indorsement (as it is called) of the writ is applicable in all
actions where the plaintiff seeks merely to recover a debt
or liquidated demand in money payable by the defendant,
with or without interest, arising upon a contract, express
or implied, as, for instance, on a bill of exchange, promis-
sory note, check, or other simple contract debt, or on a
bond or contract under seal for payment of a liquidated
amount of money, or on a statute where the sum sought to
be recovered is a fixed sum of money or in the nature of a
debt, or on a guaranty, whether under seal or not. Brown.

has nor is legally bound to have sufficient power to avoid
it or prevent its injuring another. Stephens v. Virginia
Elec. & Power Co., 184 Va. 94, 34 S.E.2d 374, 377.
Inevitable accident occurs where a vessel is pursuing a
lawful avocation in a lawful manner, using the proper pre-
cautions against danger, and an accident occurs. The
highest degree of caution that can be used is not required.
It is enough that it is reasonable under the circumstances;
such as is usual in similar cases, and has been found by
long experience to be sufficient to answer the end in view,-
the safety of life and property. The Grace Girdler, 7 Wall.
196, 19 L.Ed. 113. Inevitable accident is only when the dis-
aster happens from natural causes, without negligence or
fault on either side, and when both parties have endeav-
ored, by every means in their power, with due care and
caution, and with a proper display of nautical skill, to pre-
vent the occurrence of the accident. The Philip J. Kenny,
C.C.A.N.J., 60 F.2d 457, 458.

450, 56 P. 767.

## INFANCY

Minority; the state of a person who
is under the age of legal majority,—at common
law, twenty-one years. According to the sense in
which this term is used, it may denote the condi-
tion of the person merely with reference to his
years, or the contractual disabilities which non-
age entails, or his status with regard to other
powers or relations. Keating v. Railroad Co., 94
Mich. 219, 53 N.W. 1053.

19 Viet. c. 43. By virtue of this act every infant,
(if a male, of twenty, or, if a female, of seventeen,

division of the high court, make a valid settle-

## INFECTION

In medical jurisprudence. The
transmission of disease or disease germs from one
person to another, either directly by contact with
morbidly affected surfaces, or more remotely
through inhalation, absorption of food or liquid
tainted with excremental matter, contact with con-
taminated clothing or bedding, or other agencies.
A distinction is sometimes made between "infection" and
"contagion," by restricting the latter term to the communi-
cation of disease by direct contact. Grayson v. Lynch, 163
U.S. 468, 16 S.Ct. 1064, 41 L.Ed. 230. But "infection" is the
wider term and in proper use includes "contagion," and is
frequently extended so as to include the local inauguration
of disease from other than human sources, as from mias-
mas, poisonous plants, etc. In another, and perhaps more
accurate sense, contagion is the entrance or lodgment of
pathogenic germs in the system as a result of direct con-
tact; infection is their fixation in the system or the in-
auguration of disease as a consequence. In this meaning,
infection does not always result from contagion, and on
the other hand it may result from the introduction of dis-
ease germs into the system otherwise than by contagion.
Auto-infection. The communication of disease
from one part of the body to another by mechani-
cal transmission of virus from a diseased to a
healthy part.
Infectious disease. One capable of being trans-

sine," meaning the instrument of possession. For-
merly it was synonymous with "investiture." Bell.

## INFERENCE

In the law of evidence. A truth
or proposition drawn from another which is sup-
posed or admitted to be true. A process of rea-
soning by which a fact or proposition sought to
be established is deduced as a logical consequence
from other facts, or a state of facts, already
proved or admitted. Whitehouse v. Bolster, 95
Me. 458, 50 A. 240; Joske v. Irvine, 91 Tex. 574, 44
S.W. 1059.
A deduction which the reason of the jury makes from
the facts proved, without an express direction of law to
that effect. Puget Sound Electric Ry. v. Benson, C.C.A.
Wash., 253 F. 710, 714.
A "presumption" and an "inference" are not the same
thing, a presumption being a deduction which the law
requires a trier of facts to make, an inference being a
deduction which the trier may or may not make, according
to his own conclusions; a presumption is mandatory, an
inference, permissible. Cross v. Passumpsic Fiber Leather
Co., 90 Vt. 397, 98 A. 1010, 1014; Joyce v. Missouri & Kan-
sas Telephone Co., Mo.App., 211 S.W. 900, 901.

by inferences or conclusions drawn from the evi-
dence. Railway Co. v. Miller, 141 Ind. 533, 37 N.E.

## INFERIOR

One who, in relation to another, has
less power and is below him; one who is bound
to obey another. He who makes the law is the
superior: he who is bound to obey it, the inferior.
1 Bouv. Inst. no. 8.

## INFERIOR COURT

This term may denote any
court subordinate to the chief appellate tribunal
in the particular judicial system; but it is com-
monly used as the designation of a court of spe-
cial, limited, or statutory jurisdiction, whose rec-
ord must show the existence and attaching of
jurisdiction in any given case, in order to give
presumptive validity to its judgment. In re
Heard's Guardianship, 174 Miss. 37, 163 So. 685,
The English courts of judicature are classed generally
under two heads,—the superior courts and the inferior
courts; the former division comprising the courts at West-
minster, the latter comprising all the other courts in gen-
eral, many of which, however, are far from being of
inferior importance in the common acceptation of the
word. Brown.

no religion that can bind his conscience to speak
the truth. 1 Greenl. Ev. § 368. One who does not

## INFIRMATIVE FACT

In the law of evidence.
A fact set up, proved, or even supposed, in opposi-
tion to the criminative facts of a case, the tend-
ency of which is to weaken the force of the in-
ference of guilt deducible from them. 3 Benth.
Jud. Ev. 14; Best, Pres. § 217, et seq.

## INFIRMATIVE HYPOTHESIS

A term some-
times used in criminal evidence to denote an hy-
pothesis or theory of the case which assumes the-
defendant's innocence, and explains the crimina-
tive evidence in a manner consistent with that as-
sumption.

## INFIRMITY

In an application for insurance an
ailment or disease of a substantial character,

of the violation of some penal statute.
Common informer. A common prosecutor. A
person who habitually ferrets out crimes and of-
fenses and lays information thereof before the
ministers of justice, in order to set a prosecution
on foot, not because of his office or any special
duty in the matter, but for the sake of the share
of the fine or penalty which the law allots to the
informer in certain cases. Also used in a less in-
vidious sense, as designating persons who were
authorized and empowered to bring action for
penalties. U. S. v. Stocking, D.C.Mont., 87 F. 861;

## INFORTIATUM

The name given by the glossa-
tors to the second of the three parts or volumes
into which the Pandects were divided. It com-
mences with the third title of the twenty-fourth
book and ends with the thirty-eighth book. The
glossators at Bologna had at first only two parts,
the first called "Digestum Vetus," (the old Digest,)
and the last called "Digestum Novum," (the New
Digest.) When they afterwards received the mid-
dle or second part, they separated from the Diges-
turn, Novum the beginning it had then, and added
it to the second part, from which enlargement the
latter received the name "Infortiatum." Mackeld.
Rom. Law, § 110.

below, in the descending line, son and daughter.
Inst. 3. 6. 1.
In another sense, this word signifies within: as,
infra corpus civitatis, within the body of the coun-
try; infra prcesidia, within the guards. So of

(N.Y.) 364.

son-Houston Electric Co. v. Specialty Co., C.C.
Conn., 72 F. 1016; Safety Car Heating & Lighting
Co. v. Gould Coupler Co., D.C.N.Y., 229 F. 429, 439.
Infringement of copyright. A copy, more or less
servile, of a copyrighted work. Mere likeness is
insufficient, and an original treatment of a sub-
ject, open alike to treatment by the copyright
holder and others does not constitute infringe-
ment. Pellegrini v. Allegrini, D.C.Pa., 2 F.2d 610,
612. There must be appropriation of substantial
portions of the copyright matter. Roe-Lawton v.
Hal E. Roach Studios, D.C.Cal., 18 F.2d 126, 127;

Wire Works, C.C.A.Mich., 128 F.2d 6, 8.

In Roman law. A person who, im-
mediately that he was born, was a free person.
He was opposed to libertinus, or libertus, who,
having been born a slave, was afterwards manu-
mitted or made free. It is not the same as the
English law term "generosus," which denoted a
person not merely free, but of good family. There
were no distinctions among ingenui; but among
libertine there were (prior to Justinian's abolition
of the distinctions) three varieties, namely: Those
of the highest rank, called "Cives Romani;" those
of the second rank, called "Latini Juniani;" and
those of the lowest rank, called "Dediticii."
Brown.

## INGRATITUDE

In Roman law, ingratitude was
accounted a sufficient cause for revoking a gift

also the law of France, with respect to the first
case. But the English law has left the matter en-
tirely to the moral sense.

## INGRESS, EGRESS, AND REGRESS

These
words express the right of a lessee to enter, go

"The words 'inhabitant,' 'citizen,' and 'resident,' as
employed in different constitutions to define the qualifita-
tions of electors, mean substantially the same thing; and
one is an inhabitant, resident, or citizen at the place where
he has his domicile or home." Cooley, Const.Lim. *600;
State ex rel. Sathre v. Moodie, 65 N.D. 340, 258 N.W. 558,
564. But the terms "resident" and "inhabitant" have also
been held not synonymous, the latter implying a more fixed
and permanent abode than the former, and importing privi-
leges and duties to which a mere resident would not be
subject. Tazewell County v. Davenport, 40 Ill. 197; State,
to Use of Knox County Collector, v. Bunce, 187 Mo.App.
607, 173 S.W. 101, 102.
When relating to municipal rights, powers, or duties, the
word inhabitant is almost universally used as signifying
precisely the same as domiciled; Borland v. City of Boston,
132 Mass. 98, 42 Am.Rep. 424.
A corporation can be an inhabitant only in the state of
its incorporation. Sperry Products v. Association of Amer-
ican Railroads, C.C.A.N.Y., 132 F.2d 408, 411; Vogel v.
Crown Cork & Seal Co., D.C.Md., 36 F.Supp. 74, 75; Inter-

A tax assessed in
England on inhabited dwelling houses, according
to their annual value, (St. 14 & 15 Vict. c. 36; 32
& 33 Vict. c. 14, § 11,) which is payable by the oc-
cupier, the landlord being deemed the occupier
where the house is let to several persons. (St. 48
Geo. III. c. 55, Schedule B.) Houses occupied
solely for business purposes are exempt from
duty, although a care-taker may dwell therein, and
houses partially occupied for business purposes
are to that extent exempt. Sweet.

## INHERE

thing else; to stick fast. Majestic Theater Co. v.
Lutz, 210 Ky. 92, 275 S.W. 16, 20.

So.2d 824, 825.

## INHERENTLY DANGEROUS

Danger inhering
in instrumentality or condition itself at all times,
so as to require special precautions to prevent in-
jury, not danger arising from mere casual or col-
lateral negligence of others with respect thereto
under particular circumstances. Brown v. City
of Craig, 350 Mo. 836, 168 S.W.2d 1080, 1082; Em-
480; Hull v. Gillioz, 344 Mo. 1227, 130 S.W.2d 623,

Estate, 167 Or. 295, 117 P.2d 832, 836. "To inherit
to" a person is a common expression in the books.

The word is also used in its popular sense, as
the equivalent of to take or receive. Manchester
v. Loomis, 191 Iowa 554, 181 N.W. 415, 442.

## INHERITABLE BLOOD

Blood which has the
purity (freedom from attainder) and legitimacy
necessary to give its possessor the character of a
lawful heir; that which is capable of being the
medium for the transmission of an inheritance.

## INHERITANCE

An estate in things real, de-
scending to the heir. 2 Bl. Comm. 201; Rountree
v. Pursell, 39 N.E. 747, 11 Ind.App. 522. Such an
estate in lands or tenements or other things as
may be inherited by the heir. Termes de la Ley.
An estate or property which a man has by descent,
as heir to another, or which he may transmit to
another, as his heir. Litt. § 9.
A perpetuity in lands or tenements to a man and his
heirs. Cowell; Blount. The method by which children or
relatives take property from another at his death. Priddy
v. Green, Tex.Civ.App., 220 S.W. 243, 248; Horner v. Web-
ster, 33 N.J.L. 413.
Though "inheritance" in its restricted sense means some-
thing obtained through laws of descent and distribution
from an intestate, in its popular use it includes property
obtained by devise or descent. Pacheco v. Fernandez. Tex.
Civ.App., 277 S.W. 197, 198; Higby v. Martin, 167 Okl. 10,
28 P.2d 1097, 1102.
"Inheritance" is also used in the old books where "here-
ditament" is now commonly employed. Thus, Coke divides
inheritances into corporeal and incorporeal, into real, per-
sonal, and mixed, and into entire and several.
Civil Law
The succession of 'the heir to all the rights and
property of the estate-leaver. It is either testa-

Inheritance act. The English statute of 3 & 4
Wm. IV. c. 106, by which the law of inheritance or
descent was considerably modified. 1 Steph.
Comm. 359, 500.
Inheritance tax. A tax on the transfer or pass-
ing of estates or property by legacy, devise, or in-
testate succession; not a tax on the property it-
self, but on the right to acquire it by descent or
testamentary gift. In re Gihon's Estate, 169 N.Y.
tions and Taxation, 258 Mass. 253, 154 N.E. 844,
845. A tax on the succession to, or transfer of,
property occasioned by death. Waddell v. Dough-
ton, 194 N.C. 537, 140 S.E. 160.
"Estate taxes" are based on the power to transmit or the
transmission from the dead to the living, while "legacy
taxes," or "inheritance taxes," are based on the transmis-
sion or right to- receive the property. Frick v. Lewellyn,
D.C.Pa., 298 F. 803, 810.

## INHIBITION

In Ecclesiastical law. A writ is-
suing from a superior ecclesiastical court, forbid-
ding an inferior judge to proceed further in a
cause pending before him. In this sense it is
closely analogous to the writ of prohibition at
common law. Also the command of a bishop or ec-
clesiastical judge that a clergyman shall cease
from taking any duty.
In English law. The name of a writ which for-
bids a judge from further proceeding in a cause
depending before him; it is in the nature of a
prohibition. Termes de la Ley; Fitzh. N. B. 39.
In Scotch law. A species of diligence or process
by which a debtor is prohibited from contracting
any debt which may become a burden on his her-
itable property, in competition with the creditor at

## INHUMAN TREATMENT

In the law of divorce.
Such barbarous cruelty or severity as endangers
the life or health of the party to whom it is ad-
dressed, or creates a well-founded apprehension
of such danger. Whaley v. Whaley, 68 Iowa 647,
27 N.W. 809; Cole v. Cole, 23 Iowa 433. The
phrase commonly employed in statutes is "cruel
and inhuman treatment," from which it may be in-
ferred that "inhumanity" is an extreme or ag-
gravated "cruelty."

## INIQUISSIMA PAX EST ANTEPONENDA JUS- TISSIMO BELLO

interchangeably, and, within legislative meaning and judi-
cial interpretation, import the same thing. In re City of
Pittsburgh, 90 A. 329, 331, 243 Pa. 392, 52 L.R.A.,N.S., 262.

Ideal Fuel Co. v. Industrial Commission, 298 Ill.
463, 131 N.E. 649, 650.
Within the Workmen's Compensation Act, one which
occurs in the course of the employment, unexpectedly, and
without the affirmative act or design of the employe; it
being something which is unforeseen and not expected by
the person to whom it happens. Jakub v. Industrial Com-
mission, 288 Ill. 87, 123 N.E. 263, 264. Any injury to an
employee in the course of his employment due to any
occurrence referable to a definite time, and of the happen-
ing of which he can give notice to his employer, regardless
of whether the injury is a visible hurt from external force,
or disease or infection induced by sudden and castastrophic
exposure. Lerner v. Rump Bros., 209 N.Y.S. 698, 701, 212
App.Div. 747. The term is to receive a broad and liberal
construction with a view to compensating injured employes
where injury resulted through some accidental means, was
unexpected and undesigned and may be the result of mere
mischance or miscalculation as to effect of voluntary action.
Thomas v. Ford Motor Co., 114 Okl. 3, 242 P. 765, 766. It
includes an accident causing injury to the physical struc-
ture of the body, notwithstanding a natural weakness pre-
disposing to injury. Wilkins v. Ben's Home Oil Co., 166
Minn. 41, 207 N.W. 183. The words indicate, not so much
the existence of an accident, but rather the idea that the
injury was unexpected or unintended. Victory Sparkler
& Specialty Co. v. Francks, 147 Md. 368, 128 A. 635, 639, 44
A.L.R. 363.

criminal offense, which may be redressed by
means of a civil action. Cullinan v. Burkhard, 41

An infringement or privation of the civil rights which

State v. Magee Pub. Co., 29 N.M. 455, 224 P. 1028, 38
A. L. R. 142.
Irreparable injury. This phrase does not mean
such an injury as is beyond the possibility of re-
pair, or beyond possible compensation in damages,
or necessarily great damage, but includes an in-
jury, whether great or small, which ought not to
be submitted to, on the one hand, or inflicted, on
the other; and which, because it is so large or so
small, or is of such constant and frequent occur-
rence, or because no certain pecuniary standard
exists for the measurement of damages, cannot
receive reasonable redress in a court of law.
Wrongs of a repeated and continuing character,
or which occasion damages that are estimated
only by conjecture, and not by any accurate stand-
ard, are included. Johnson v. Kier, 3 Pittsb. R.
(Pa.) 204; Scherman v. Stern, 117 A. 631, 633, 93
N.J.Eq. 626; Birchfield v. Bourland, Tex.Civ.App.,
187 S.W. 422, 423.
Personal injury. A hurt or damage done to a
man's person, such as a cut or bruise, a broken
limb, or the like, as distinguished from an injury
to his property or his reputation. The phrase
is chiefly used in connection with actions of tort
for negligence. Norris v. Grove, 100 Mich. 256,
58 N.W. 1006; State v. Clayborne, 14 Wash. 622,
45 P. 303. But the term is also used (chiefly in
statutes) in a much wider sense, and as including
any injury which is an invasion of personal rights,
and in this signification it may include such in-
juries as libel or slander, criminal conversation
with a wife, seduction of a daughter, and mental
suffering. McDonald v. Brown, 23 R.I. 546, 51 A.
213, 58 L.R.A. 768, 91 Am.St.Rep. 659.
In Workmen's Compensation Acts, "personal injury"
means any harm or damage to the health of an employee,
however caused, whether by accident, disease, or otherwise,
which arises in the course of and out of his employment,
and incapacitates him in whole or in part. Hines v. Nor-
walk Lcck Co., 100 Conn. 533, 124 A. 17, 20; Lane v. Horn
& Hardart Baking Co., 261 Pa. 329, 104 A. 615, 616, 13
A.L.R. 963; Hanson v. Dickinson, 188 Iowa, 728, 176 N.W.
823, 824. A disease of mind or body which arises in the
course of employment with nothing more is not within the
Massachusetts act, but it must come from or by an injury,
although that injury need not be a single definite act, but
may extend over a continuous period of time. In re Mag-
gelet, 228 Mass. 57, 116 N.E. 972, 973, L.R.A.1918F, 864;
Taylor v. Swift & Co., 114 Kan. 431, 219 P. 516, 519. A
"personal injury," as that term is used in the Workmen's
Compensation Act, refers not to some break in some part
of the body, or some wound thereon, or the like, but rather
to the consequence or disability that results therefrom.
Indian Creek Coal & Mining Co. v. Calvert, 68 Ind.App. 474,
119 N.E. 519, 525.
Permanent injury. An injury that, according
to every reasonable probability, will continue
throughout the remainder of one's life. Alabama
Great Southern R. Co. v. Taylor, 196 Ala. 37, 71
So. 676, 678.
Private injuries. Infringements of the private
or civil rights belonging to individuals considered
as individuals.
Public injuries. Breaches and violations of
rights and duties which affect the whole com-
munity as a community.
Real injury. A real injury is inflicted by any
act by which a person's honor or dignity is af-
fected.
Relative injuries. Injuries to those rights which
a person possesses in relation to the person who
is immediately affected by the wrongful act done.
Reparable injury. The general principle is that
an injury, the damage from which is merely in
the nature of pecuniary loss, and can be exactly
and fully repaired by compensation in money, is
a "reparable injury" for which a bond of sufficient
quate indemnity. Barrow v. Duplantis, 148 La.
149, 86 So. 718, 723.
Verbal injury. A verbal injury, when directed
against a private person, consists in the uttering
contumelious words, which tend to injure his rep-
utation by making him little or ridiculous.

## INJUSTICE

The withholding or denial of jus-
tice. In law, almost invariably applied to the act,
fault, or omission of a court, as distinguished from
that of an individual. Holton v. Olcott, 58 N.H.
598; In re Moulton, 50 N.H. 532.
"Fraud" is deception practised by the party; "injustice"
is the fault or error of the court. They are not equivalent
words in substance, or in a statute authorizing a new trial
on a showing of fraud or injustice. Fraud is always the
result of contrivance and deception; injustice may be done
by the negligence, mistake, or omission of the court itself.
Silvey v. U. S., 7 Ct.C1. 324.
INJUSTUM EST, NISI TOTA LEGE INSPECTA,
DE UNA ALIQUA EJUS PARTICULA PROPO-
SITA JUDICARE VEL RESPONDERE, 8 Coke,
117b. It is unjust to decide or respond as to any
particular part of a law without examining the
whole of the law.

In old English law, inland was used for the
demesne (q. v.) of a manor; that part which lay
next or most convenient for the lord's mansion-
house, as within the view thereof, and which,
therefore, he kept in his own hands for support
of his family and for hospitality; in distinction
from outland or utland, which was the portion let
out to tenants. Cowell; Kennett; Spelman.

## INLAND BILL OF EXCHANGE

A bill of which
both the drawer and drawee reside within the
same state or country. Otherwise called a "dom-
estic bill," and distinguished from a "foreign bill."
Buckner v. Finley, 2 Pet. 589, 7 L.Ed. 528; Lons-
dale v. Brown, 15 Fed.Cas. 857; Strawbridge v.
Robinson, 10 Ill. 472, 50 Am.Dec. 420.
See Bill.

## INLAND NAVIGATION

Within the meaning of
the legislation of congress upon the subject, this
phrase means navigation upon the rivers of the
country, but not upon the great lakes. Moore v.
American Transp. Co., 24 How. 38, 16 L.Ed. 674.

## INLAND TRADE

Trade wholly carried on at
home; as distinguished from commerce. See
commerce.

## INLAND WATERS

v. Steam Vessels of War, 1 S.Ct. 539, 106 U.S. 607,
27 L.Ed. 286; The Cotton Plant, 10 Wall. 581, 19
L.Ed. 983; Cogswell v. Chubb, 36 N.Y.S. 1076, 1
App.Div. 93.

the law, (sub lege,) in a frank-pledge, or decen-
nary. Bract. fol. 125b.

## INLAW

To place under the protection of the

which doth inlaw the subject." Bacon.

## INLEASED

In old English law. Entangled, or

in who has gone there for the purpose of illicit
sexual intercourse. People v. Anonymous, 292 N.
Y.S. 282, 285, 161 Misc. 379.

## INN

An inn is a house where a traveler is fur-
nished with everything which he has occasion for
while on his way. Waitt Const. Co. y. Chase, 188
N.Y.S. 589, 592, 197 App.Div. 327. A house where
all who conduct themselves properly, and who are
able and ready to pay for their entertainment,
are received, if there is accommodation for them,
and who, without any stipulated engagement as to
the duration of their stay, or as to the rate of
compensation, are, while there, supplied at a rea-
sonable charge with their meals, their lodging, and
such services and attention as are necessarily in-
cident to the use of the house as a temporary
home. Ford v. Waldorf System, 57 RI. 131, 188 A.
633, 635. A place where the public will be re-
ceived and accommodations provided to guests
for compensation. Edwards v. City of Los An-
geles, 48 Cal.App.2d 62, 119 P.2d 370, 373, 374.
Under the term "inn" the law includes all tav-
erns, hotels, and houses of public general enter-
tainment for guests. Code Ga. 1882, § 2114 (Civ.
Code 1910, § 3505).
See, also Hotel.
The words "inn," "tavern," and "hotel" are used synon
ymously to designate what is ordinarily and popularly
known as an "inn" or "tavern," or place for the entertain-
ment of travelers, and where all their wants can be sup-
plied. A restaurant where meals only are furnished is not
an inn or tavern. Carpenter v. Taylor, 1 Hilt., N.Y., 193.
An inn is distinguished from a private boarding-house
mainly in this : that the keeper of the latter is at liberty
to choose his guests, while the innkeeper is obliged to
entertain and furnish all travelers of good conduct and
means of payment with what they may have occasion for,
as such travelers, while on their way. Pinkerton v. Wood-
ward, 33 Cal. 557, 91 Am. Dec. 657. Another distinction is
that in a boarding-house the guest is under an express con-
tract for a certain time at a certain rate, whereas, in an
inn the guest is entertained from day to day upon an
implied contract. Willard v. Reinhardt, 2 E.D.Smith, N.Y.,
148. A lodging house does not become an "inn" because a
register is kept. Roberts v. Case Hotel Co., 175 N.Y.S. 123,
127, 106 Misc. 481.
Common Inn. A house for the entertainment
of travelers and passengers, in which lodging and
necessaries are provided for them and for their
horses and attendants. Cromwell v. Stephens,
2 Daly (N.Y.) 15. The word "common," in this
connection, does not appear to add anything to the
common-law definition of an inn, except in so far
as it lays stress on the fact that the house is for
the entertainment of the general public or for all
suitable persons who apply for accommodations.

## INNAMIUM

In old English law. A pledge.

## INNAVIGABILITY

In insurance law. The con-
dition of being innavigable, (q. v.) The foreign
writers distinguish "innavigability" from "ship-
wreck." 3 Kent, Comm. 323, and note. The term
is also applied to the condition of streams which
are not large enough or deep enough, or are other-
wise unsuited, for navigation.

## INNAVIGABLE

As applied to streams, not cap-
able of or suitable for navigation; impassable by
ships or vessels.
As applied to vessels in the law of marine in-
surance, it means unfit for navigation; so dam-
aged by misadventures at sea as to be no longer
capable of making a voyage. See 3 Kent, Comm.
323, note.

## INNER BARRISTER

A serjeant or king's coun-
sel, in England, who is admitted to plead within
the bar.

## INNER HOUSE

The name given to the chambers
in which the first and second divisions of the court
of session in Scotland hold their sittings. See
Outer House.

## INNINGS

In old records. Lands recovered from
the sea by draining and banking. Cowell.

## INNKEEPER

One who keeps an inn or house
for the lodging and entertainment of travelers.
The keeper of a common inn for the lodging and
entertainment of travelers and passengers, their
horses and attendants, for a reasonable compensa-
tion. Story, Bailm. § 475. One who keeps a tavern
or coffeehouse in which lodging is provided. 2
Steph. Comm. 133. See Inn.
One who receives as guests all who choose to visit his
house, without any previous agreement as to the time of
their stay, or the terms. His liability as innkeeper ceases
when his guest pays his bill, and leaves the house with the
declared intention of not returning, notwithstanding the
guest leaves his baggage behind him. Wintermute v. Clark,
5 Sandf., N.Y., 242.
The words "innkeeper" and "hotel keeper" are synon-
ymous, but each is distinct from a "boarding house keep-
er," in that the innkeeper has no right to select his guests,
who conducts himself in a proper manner, etc., while the
keeper of a boarding house is one who maintains a house
for the accommodation of those who enter under contract
for entertainment at a certain rate for a certain period at
an agreed compensation. McClaugherty v. Cline, 128 Tenn.
605, 163 S.W. 801. One who entertains strangers occasion-
ally, although he may receive compensation for it, is not
an innkeeper.

## INNOCENCE

The absence of guilt.

## INNOCENT

Free from guilt; acting in good
faith and without knowledge of incriminatory
circumstances, or of defects or objections.

## INNOCENT AGENT

In criminal law. One who,
being ignorant of any unlawful intent on the part
of his principal, is merely the instrument of the
guilty party in committing an offense; one who
does an unlawful act at the solicitation or request
of another, but who, from defect of understand-
ing or ignorance of the inculpatory facts, incurs
no legal guilt. Smith v. State, 21 Tex.App. 107,
17 S.W. 552; State v. Carr, 28 Or. 389, 42 P. 215.

## INNOCENT CONVEYANCES

A technical term
of the English law of conveyancing, used to desig-
nate such conveyances as may be made by a lease-
hold tenant without working a forfeiture. These
are said to be lease and re-lease, bargain and sale,
and, in case of a life-tenant, a covenant to stand
seised. 1 Chit. Pr. 243.

## INNOCENT PURCHASER

One who, by an hon-
est contract or agreement, purchases property or
acquires an interest therein, without knowledge,
or means of knowledge sufficient to charge him in
law with knowledge, of any infirmity in the title
of the seller. Republic Power and Service Co. v.
Continental Credit Corporation, 178 Ark. 966, 12
S.W.2d 906, 908.

## INNOCENT TRESPASS

A trespass to land,
committed, not recklessly, but through inadver-
tence or mistake, or in good faith, under an honest
belief that the trespasser was acting within his
legal rights. Elk Garden Big Vein Mining Co. v.
Gerstell, 100 W.Va. 472, 131 S.E. 152, 153.

## INNOCENT TRESPASSER

One who enters an-
other's land unlawfully, but inadvertently or un-
intentionally, or in the honest, reasonable belief of
his own right so to do, and removes sand or other
material therefrom, is an "innocent trespasser."
American Sand & Gravel Co. v. Spencer, 55 Ind.
App. 523, 103 N.E. 426, 427.

## INNOCENT WOMAN

One who has never had
illicit intercourse with a man. State v. Cline, 170
N.C. 751, 87 S.E. 106, 107.

## INNOMINATE

In the civil law. Not named or
classed; belonging to no specific class; ranking
under a general head. A term applied to those
contracts for which no certain or precise remedy
was appointed, but a general action on the case
only. Dig. 2, 1, 4, 7, 2; Id. 19, 4, 5.
INNOMINATE CONTRACTS, literally, are the
"unclassified" contracts of Roman law. They are
contracts which are neither re, verbis, literis, nor
upon two or more of such contracts. They are
principally the contracts of permutatio, de cestima-
to, precarium, and transactio. Brown.

## INNONIA

In old English law. A close or in-
closure, (clausum, inclausura.) Spelman.

## INNOTESCIMUS

Lat. We make known. A
term formerly applied to letters patent, derived
from the emphatic word at the conclusion of the
Latin forms. It was a species of exemplification
of charters of feoffment or other instruments not
of record. 5 Coke, 54a.

## INNOVATION

In Scotch law. The exchange of
one obligation for another, so as to make the sec-
ond obligation come in the place of the first, and
be the only subsisting obligation against the debt-
or. Bell. The same with "novation," (q. v.)
INNOXIARE. In old English law. To purge one
of a fault and make him innocent.

## INNS OF CHANCERY

So called because an-
ciently inhabited by such clerks as chiefly studied
the framing of writs, which regularly belonged to
the cursitors, who were officers of the court of
chancery. There are nine of them,—Clement's,
Clifford's, and Lyon's Inn; Furnival's, Thavies',
and Symond's Inn; New Inn; and Barnard's and
Staples' Inn. These were formerly preparatory
colleges for students, and many entered them be-
fore they were admitted into the inns of court.
They consist chiefly of solicitors, and possess cor-
porate property, hall, chambers, etc., but perform
no public functions like the inns of court. Whar-
ton.

## INNS OF COURT

These are certain private un-
incorporated associations, in the nature of col-
legiate houses, located in London, and invested
with the exclusive privilege of calling men to the
bar; that is, conferring the rank or degree of a
barrister. They were founded probably about the
beginning of the fourteenth century. The princi-
pal inns of court are the Inner Temple, Middle
Temple, Lincoln's Inn, and Gray's Inn. (The two
former originally belonged to the Knights Temp-
lar; the two latter to the earls of Lincoln and Gray
respectively.) These bodies now have a "common
council of legal education," for giving lectures and
holding examinations. The inns of chancery, dis-
tinguishable from the foregoing, but generally
classed with them under the general name, are the
buildings known as "Clifford's Inn," "Clement's
Inn," "New Inn," "Staples' Inn," and "Barnard's
Inn." They were formerly a sort of collegiate
houses in which law students learned the elements
of law before being admitted into the inns of
court, but they have long ceased to occupy that
position.

## INNUENDO

This Latin word (commonly trans-
lated "meaning") was the technical beginning of
that clause in a declaration or indictment for
slander or libel in which the meaning of the al-
leged libelous words was explained, or the applica-
tion of the language charged to the plaintiff was
pointed out. Hence It gave its name to the whole
clause; and this usage is still retained, although
an equivalent English word is now substituted.
Thus, it may be charged that the defendant said
"he (meaning the said plaintiff) is a perjurer."
An "innuendo" in pleading in libel action is a
statement by plaintiff of construction which he
puts upon words which are alleged to be libelous
and which meaning he will induce jury to adopt
at trial. Burr v. Winnett Times Pub. Co., 80 Mont.
70, 258 P. 242, 244.
The word is also used, (though more rarely,)
in other species of pleadings, to introduce an ex-
planation of a preceding word, charge, or aver-
ment. Guide Pub. Co. v. Futrell, 175 Va. 77, 7
S.E.2d 133, 138.
It is said to mean no more than the words "id est,"
"scilicet," or "meaning," or "aforesaid," as explanatory
of a subject-matter sufficiently expressed before; as "such
a one, meaning the defendant," or "such a subject, mean-
ing the subject in question." Cowp. 683. It is only explan-
atory of some matter already expressed. It serves to point
out where there is precedent matter, but never for a new
charge. It may apply what is already expressed, but can-
not add to or enlarge or change the sense of the previous
words. See Grand v. Dreyfus, 122 Cal. 58, 54 P. 389; Kee
v. Armstrong, Byrd & Co., 75 Okl. 84, 182 P. 494, 498, 5
A.L.R. 1349. The office of an "innuendo" is to explain the
words published, and to give to them their true meaning,
and it cannot introduce new matter, add to or enlarge the
sense of those words, or impute to them a meaning not
warranted by the publication, when taken alone, or read in
connection with the inducement and colloquium. Bowie v.
Evening News, 148 Md. 569, 129 A. 797, 800; Drebin v.
Jewish World Pub. Co., 262 Pa. 169, 105 A. 58, 59. Its office
is to set a meaning upon words or language of doubtful or
ambiguous import which alone would not be actionable.
Rail v. National Newspaper Ass'n, 198 Mo.App. 463, 192
S.W. 129, 134.

## INOFFICIOSUM

In the civil law. Inofficious;
contrary to natural duty or affection. Used of a
will of a parent which disinherited a child without
just cause, or that of a child which disinherited
a parent, and which could be contested by querela
inofficiosi testamenti. Dig. 2, 5, 3, 13; Paulus, lib.
4, tit. 5, § 1.

## INOFFICIOUS TESTAMENT

A will not in ac-
cordance with the testator's natural affection and
moral duties. In re Willford's Will (N.J.) 51 A.
502. But particularly, in the civil law, a will which
deprives the heirs of that portion of the estate to
which the law entitles them, and of which they
cannot legally be disinherited. Mackeld. Rom.
Law, § 714; Civ. Code La. art. 3556, subd. 16. A
testament contrary to the natural duty of the
parent, because it totally disinherited the child,
without expressly giving the reason therefor.

## INOFICIOCIDAD

In Spanish law. Every thing
done contrary to a duty or obligation assumed,
as well as in opposition to the piety and affection
dictated by nature: inofficiosum dicitur id omne
quod contra pietatis officium factum est. The
term applies especially to testaments, donations,
dower, etc., which may be either revoked or re-
duced when they affect injuriously the rights of
creditors or heirs.

## INOPS CONSILII

Lat. Destitute of counsel;
without legal counsel. A term applied to the acts
or condition of one acting without legal advice, as
a testator drafting his own will.

## INORDINATUS

An intestate.
INPENY and GUTPENY. In old English law. A
customary payment of a penny on entering into
and going out of a tenancy, (pro exitu de tenura,
et pro ingressu.) Spelman.

## INQUEST

A body of men appointed by law to
inquire into certain matters. The grand jury
is sometimes called the "grand inquest." The
judicial inquiry made by a jury summoned for the
purpose is called an "inquest." The finding of
such men, upon an investigation, is also called an
"inquest." People v. Coombs, 55 N.Y.S. 276, 36
App.Div. 284; Davis v. Bibb County, 116 Ga. 23, 42
S.E. 403.
The inquiry by a coroner, termed a "coroner's
inquest," into the manner of the death of any one
who has been slain, or has died suddenly or in
prison.
This name is also given to a species of pro-
ceeding under the New York practice, allowable
where the defendant in a civil action has not filed
an affidavit of merits nor verified his answer. In
such case the issue may be taken up, out of its
regular order, on plaintiff's motion, and tried with-
out the admission of any affirmative defense.
An inquest is a trial of an issue of fact where the plain-
tiff alone introduces testimony. The defendant is entitled
to appear at the taking of the inquest, and to cross-examine
the plaintiff's witnesses; and, if he do appear, the inquest
must be taken before a jury, unless a jury be expressly
waived by him. Haines v. Davis, 6 How.Prac., N.Y., 118.
The term "inquest," as applied to Surrogates' Courts, is
a term of larger signification than as applied to proceedings
at common law, and includes the exercise of the surrogate's
function to determine all the circumstances concerning the
genuineness of a will offered for probate, and the validity
of its execution, without reference to whether there is a
contest or not; his judicial power arising only after he has
determined that the will is genuine and validly executed.
In re Hermann's Will, 145 N.Y.S. 291, 297, 83 Misc. 283.
General
Coroner's inquest. See Coroner.
Inquest, arrest of. See Arrest.
Inquest of lunacy. See Inquisition (or Inquest)
of Lunacy.
Inquest of office. In English practice. An in-
quiry made by the king's (or the queen's) officer,
his sheriff, coroner, or escheator, virtute or
by writ sent to them for that purpose, or by com-
missioners specially appointed, concerning any
matter that entitles the king to the possession of
lands or tenements, goods or chattels; as to in-
quire whether the king's tenant for life died
seised, whereby the reversion accrues to the king;
whether A., who held immediately of the crown,
died without heir, in which case the lands belong
to the king by escheat; whether B. be attainted
of treason, whereby his estate is forfeited to the
crown; whether C., who has purchased land, be
an alien, which is another cause of forfeiture, etc.
3 Bl. Comm. 258. These inquests of office were
more frequent in practice during the continuance
of the military tenures than at present; and were
devised by law as an authentic means to give the
king his right by solemn matter of record. Id.
258, 259; 4 Steph. Comm. 40, 41. Sometimes sim-
ply termed "office," as in the phrase "office found,"
(q. v.). Atlantic & P. R. Co. v. Mingus, 17 S.Ct.
348, 165 U.S. 413, 41 L.Ed. 770; Baker v. Shy, 9
Heisk. (Tenn.) 89.
Inquest of sheriffs. An inquest which directs a
general inquiry as to the methods in which the
sheriffs had been conducting the local government
of the country (1170). 1 Holdsw. H. E. L. 21.

## INQUILINUS

In Roman law. A tenant; one
who hires and occupies another's house; but par-
ticularly, a tenant of a hired house in a city, as
distinguished from colonus, the hirer of a house
or estate in the country. Calvin.

## INQUIRENDO

An authority given to some of-
ficial person to institute an inquiry concerning
the crown's interests.

## INQUIRY, WRIT OF

A writ sued out by a plain-
tiff in a case where the defendant has let the pro-
ceedings go by default, and an interlocutory judg-
ment has been given for damages generally, where
the damages do not admit of calculation. It issues
to the sheriff of the county in which the venue
is laid, and commands him to inquire, by a jury
of twelve men, concerning the amount of dam-
ages. The sheriff thereupon tries the cause in his
sheriff's court, and some amount must always be
returned to the court. But the return of the in-
quest merely informs the court, which may, if it
choose, in all cases assess damages and thereupon
give final judgment. 2 Archb. Pr., Waterman ed.
952; 3 Bla. Corn. 398; 3 Chitty, Stat. 495, 497.

## INQUISITIO

In old English law. An inquisition
or inquest. Inquisitio post mortem, an inquisition
after death. An inquest of office held, during the
continuance of the military tenures, upon the
death of every one of the king's tenants, to in-
quire of what lands he died seised, who was his
heir, and of what age, in order to entitle the king
to his marriage, wardship, relief, primer seisin, or
other advantages, as the circumstances of the case
might turn out. 3 Bl. Comm. 258. Inquisitio pat-
rice, the inquisition of the country; the ordinary
jury, as distinguished from the grand assise.
Bract. fol. 15b.

## INQUISITION

In practice. An inquiry or in-
quest; particularly, an investigation of certain
facts made by a sheriff, together with a jury im-
paneled by him for the purpose. The instrument
of writing on which their decision is made is also
called an inquisition.
In its broadest sense, "inquisition," includes any
judicial inquiry. Phillips v. Vessells, 2 W.W.Harr.
(Del.) 490, 126 A. 51.

## INQUISITION AFTER DEATH

See Inquisitio.
INQUISITION (or INQUEST) OF LUNACY. A
quasi-judicial examination into the sanity or in-
ing jurisdiction, on a proper application and suf-
ficient preliminary showing of facts, held by the
sheriff (or marshal, or a magistrate, or the court
itself, according to the local practice) with the as-
sistance of a special jury, usually of six men, who
are to hear evidence and render a verdict in ac-
cordance with the facts. This is the usual founda-
tion for an order appointing a guardian or con-
servator for a person adjudged to be insane, or
for committing him to an insane asylum. See
Hughes v. Jones, 116 N.Y. 67, 22 N.E. 446, 5 L.R.A.
637, 15 Am.St.Rep. 386; Hadaway v. Smith, 71 Md.
319, 18 A. 589.

## INQUISITOR

A designation of sheriffs, coroners
super visum corporis, and the like, who have pow-
er to inquire into certain matters.
In Ecclesiastical law. The name of an officer
who is authorized to inquire into heresies, and
the like, and to punish them. A judge.

## INROLL

A form of "enroll," used in the old
books. 3 Rep. Ch. 63, 73; 3 East, 410.

## INROLLMENT

See Enrollment.

## INSANE

Unsound in mind; of unsound mind;
deranged, disordered, or diseased in mind. Vio-
lently deranged; mad.

## INSANITY

Unsoundness of mind; madness;
mental alienation or derangement; a morbid psy-
chic condition resulting from iisorder of the brain,
whether arising from malformation or defective
organization or morbid processes affecting the
brain primarily or diseased states of the general
system implicating it secondarily, which involves
the intellect, the emotions, the will, and the moral
sense, or some of these faculties, and which is
characterized especially by their non-development,
derangement, or perversion, and is manifested, in
most forms, by delusions, incapacity to reason or
to j udge, or by uncontrollable impulses. In law,
such a want of reason, memory, and intelligence
as prevents a man from comprehending the nature
and consequences of his acts or from distinguish-
ing between right and wrong conduct. Crosswell
v. People, 13 Mich. 427, 87 Am.Dec. 774; Johnson
v. Insurance Co., 83 Me. 182, 22 A. 107; Frazer v.
Frazer, 2 Del.Ch. 263.
"Insanity" does not include certain states of
transitory mental disorder, such as trances, epi-
lepsy, hysteria, and delirium. Martin v. Fraternal
Reserve Life Ass'n, 200 Ill. App. 359, 364, and from
both the pathologic and the legal definitions are
to be excluded temporary mental aberrations
caused by or accompanying alcoholic or other in-
toxication and the delirium of fever.
The distinction between the medical and the legal idea
of insanity has, perhaps, not been better stated than by
Ray, who is quoted by Ordronaux, and again by Witthaus
& Becker "Insanity in medicine has to do with a pro-
longed departure of the individual from his natural mental
state arising from bodily disease." "Insanity in law covers
nothing more than the relation of the person and the par-
ticular act which is the subject of judicial investigation.
The legal problem must resolve itself into the inquiry,
whether there was mental capacity and moral freedom to
do or abstain from doing the particular act." 1 Whitth. &
Beck.Med.Jur. 181; U. S. v. Faulkner, D.C.Tex., 35 F. 730.
Other definitions
Insanity is a manifestation of disease of the brain, char-
acterized by a general or partial derangement of one or
more faculties of the mind, and in which, while conscious-
ness is not abolished, mental freedom is perverted, weak-
ened, or destroyed. Hammond, Nervous System, 332. The
prolonged departure, without any adequate cause, from the
states of feeling and modes of thinking usual to the individ-
ual in health. Bouvier. By insanity is not meant (in law)
a total deprivation of reason, but only an inability, from
defect of perception, memory, and judgment, to do the act
in question, [with an intelligent apprehension of its nature
and consequences.] So, by a lucid interval is not meant a
perfect restoration to reason, but a restoration so far as to
be able, beyond doubt, to comprehend and to do the act
with such reason, memory, and judgment as to make it a
legal act. Frazer v. Frazer, 2 Del. Ch. 263.
Eccentricities and idiosyncracies, however gross, do not
constitute "Insanity." In re Hansen's Will, 50 Utah, 207,
167 P. 256, 261. And drunkenness is not insanity, nor does
it answer to what is termed an unsound mind, unless the
derangement which it causes becomes fixed and continued
by the drunkenness 'being habitual, or by chronic alco-
holism, and thereby rendering the party incapable of dis-
tinguishing between right and wrong, the same as insanity
produced by any other cause. Rucker v. State, 119 Ohio St.
189, 162 N.E. 802, 805.
Synonyms
Delusion is sometimes loosely used as synony-
mous with insanity. But this is incorrect. De-
lusion is not the substance but the evidence of in-
sanity. Ryan v. People, 60 Colo. 425, 153 P. 756,
757, L.R.A. 1917F, 646, Ann.Cas.1917C, 605.
The presence of an insane delusion is a recognized test of
insanity in all cases except amentia and imbecility, and
where there is no frenzy or raving madness; and in this
sense an insane delusion is a fixed belief in the mind of the
patient of the existence of a fact which has no objective
existence but is purely the figment of his imagination, and
which is so extravagant that no sane person would believe
it under the circumstances of the case, the belief, neverthe-
less, being so unchangeable that the patient is incapable of
being permanently disabused by argument or proof. Walk-
er v. Struthers, 273 Ill. 387, 112 N.E. 961, 966. The charac-
teristic which distinguishes an "insane" delusion from oth-
er mistaken beliefs is that it is not a product of the reason
but of the imagination, that is, not a mistake of fact in-
duced by deception, fraud, insufficient evidence, or errone-
ous reasoning, but the spontaneous conception of a pervert-
ed imagination, having no basis whatever in reason or evi-
dence. Riggs v. Missionary Soc., 35 Hun, N.Y., 658; Bu-
chanan v. Pierie, 205 Pa. 123, 54 Atl. 583, 97 Am.St.Rep.
725. An "insane delusion" is an idea or belief which springs
spontaneously from a diseased or perverted mind without
reason or without foundation in fact. It is distinguishable
from a belief which is founded upon prejudice or aversion,
no matter how unreasonable or unfounded the prejudice or
aversion may be, and if it is the product of a reasoning
mind, no matter how slight the evidence on which it is
based, it cannot be classed as an insane delusion. Coffey
v. Miller, 160 Ky. 415, 169 S.W. 852, 854, Ann.Cas.1916C, 30.
As to the distinctions between "Delusion" and
"Illusion" and "Hallucination," see those titles.
Derangement. This term includes all forms of
mental unsoundness, except of the natural born
idiot. Hiett v. Shull, 36 W.Va. 563, 15 S.E. 147.
Idiocy is congenital amentia, that is, a want of
reason and intelligence existing from birth and
due to structural defect or malformation of the
brain. It is a congenital obliteration of the chief
mental powers, and is defined in law as that con-
dition in which the patient has never had, from
his birth, even the least glimmering of reason;
for a man is not legally an "idiot" if he can tell
his parents, his age, or other like common matters.
This is not the condition of a deranged mind, but
that of a total absence of mind, so that, while
idiocy is generally classed under the general des-
ignation of "insanity," it is rather to be regarded
as a natural defect than as a disease or as the
result of a disease. It differs from "lunacy," be-
cause there are no lucid intervals or periods of
ordinary intelligence. In re Beaumont, 1 Whart.
(Pa.) 53, 29 Am.Dec. 33; Clark v. Robinson, 88 Ill.
Imbecility. A more or less advanced decay and
feebleness of the intellectual faculties; that weak-
ness of mind which, without depriving the person
entirely of the use of his reason, leaves only the
faculty of conceiving the most common and or-
dinary ideas and such as relate almost always to
physical wants and habits. It varies in shades
and degrees from merely excessive folly and ec-
centricity to an almost total vacuity of mind or
amentia, and the test of legal capacity, in this
condition, is the stage to which the weakness of
mind has advanced, as measured by the degree of
reason, judgment, and memory remaining. It
may proceed from paresis or general paralysis,
from senile decay, or from the advanced stages of
any of the ordinary forms of insanity; and the
term is rather descriptive of the consequences of
insanity than of any particular type of the dis-
ease. Campbell v. Campbell, 130 Ill. 466, 22 N.E.
620, 6 L.R.A. 167.
Mere imbecility or weakness of mind, however great, is
not "insanity." There must be a total want of understand-
ing. Johnson v. Millard, 110 Neb. 830, 195 N.W. 485, 487.
Lunacy. At the common law, was a term used
to describe the state of one who, by sickness, grief,
or other accident, has wholly lost his memory and
understanding. Co. Litt. 246b, 247a; Corn. v. Has-
kell, 2 Brewst. (Pa.) 496. It is distinguished from
idiocy, an idiot being one who from his birth has
had no memory or understanding, while lunacy
implies the possession and subsequent loss of
mental powers. Bicknell v. Spear, 77 N.Y.S. 920,
38 Misc. Rep. 389. On the other hand, lunacy is a
total deprivation or suspension of the ordinary
powers of the mind, and is to be distinguished
from imbecility, where there is a more or less ad-
vanced decay and feebleness of the intellectual
faculties. In re Vanauken, 10 N.J.Eq. 186, 195;
Odell v. Buck, 21 Wend. (N.Y.) 142. As to all
other forms of insanity, lunacy was originally
distinguished by the occurrence of lucid intervals,
and hence might be described as a periodical or
recurrent insanity. In re Anderson, 132 N.C. 243,
43 S.E. 649. But while these distinctions are still
observed in some jurisdictions, they are more gen-
erally disregarded; so that, at present, in inquisi-
tions of lunacy and other such proceedings, the
term "lunacy" has almost everywhere come to be
synonymous with "insanity," Smith v. Hicken-
bottom, 57 Iowa, 733, 11 N.W. 664, 667, and is used
as a general description of all forms of derange..
ment or mental unsoundness, this rule being es-
tablished by statute in many states and by judicial
decisions in others, In re Clark, 175 N.Y. 139, 67 N.
E. 212.
the definition of lunacy, that is, where the patient was born
with a normal brain, but the cessation of mental growth
occurred in infancy or so near it that he never acquired any
greater intelligence or discretion than belongs to a nor-
mally healthy child. Such a subject might be scientifically
denominated an "idiot," but not legally, for in law the lat-
ter term is applicable only to congenital amentia. The
term "lucid interval" means not an apparent tranquility or
seeming repose, or cessation of the violent symptoms of the
disorder, or a simple diminution or remission of the dis-
ease, but a temporary cure—an intermission so clearly
marked that it perfectly resembles a return of health; and
it must be such a restoration of the faculties as enables the
patient beyond doubt to comprehend the nature of his acts
and transact his affairs as usual; and it must be continued
for a length of time sufficient to give certainty to the tem-
porary restoration of reason. Godden v. Burke, 35 La.Ann.
160, 173; Frazer v. Frazer, 2 Del. Ch. 260.
Non compos mentis. Lat. Not of sound mind.
A generic term applicable to all insane persons,
of whatsoever specific type the insanity may be
and from whatever cause arising, provided there
be an entire loss of reason, as distinguished from
mere weakness of mind. Somers v. Pumphrey,
24 Ind. 244. Potts v. House, 6 Ga. 350, 50 Am.
Dec. 329.
Forms and Varieties of Insanity
Without attempting a scientific classification of
the numerous types and forms of insanity, (as
to which it may be said that there is as yet no final
agreement among psychologists and alienists ei-
ther as to analysis or nomenclature,) definitions
and explanations will here be appended of the com-
pound and descriptive terms most commonly met
with in medical jurisprudence. And, first, as to
the origins or causes of the disease:
Choreic insanity is insanity arising from chorea,
the latter being a nervous disease, more common-
ly attacking children than adults, characterized by
irregular and involuntary twitchings of the mus-
cles of the limbs and face, popularly called "St.
Vitus' dance."
Congenital insanity is that which exists from the
birth of the patient, and is (in law) properly called
"idiocy." See supra.
Cretinism is a form of imperfect or arrested
mental development, which may amount to idiocy,
with physical degeneracy or deformity or lack of
development; endemic in Switzerland and some
other parts of Europe, but the term is applied to
similar states occurring elsewhere.
Delirium tremens. A disease of the nervous
system, induced by the excessive and protracted
use of intoxicating liquors. ;Etna Life Ins. Co. v.
Deming, 123 Ind. 384, 24 N.E. 86, 87, usually oc-
curring in habitual drinkers after a few days' total
abstinence from liquors, but sometimes resulting
directly and immediately from drunkenness, Erwin
v. State, 10 Tex.App. 700, 702; Knickerbocker Life

brain so as to produce incoherence and lack of con-
tinuity in the intellectual processes, a suspension
or perversion of the power of volition, and delu-
generally prompting to violence except in the ef-
fort to escape trom imaginary dangers. It is
recognized in law as a form of insanity, and may
be of such a nature or intensity as to render the
patient legally incapable of committing a crime.

1093; Insurance Co. v. Deming, 123 Ind. 384, 24

In some states the insanity of alcoholic intoxication is
classed as "temporary," where induced by the voluntary
recent use of ardent spirits and carried to such a degree
that the person becomes incapable of judging the conse-
quences or the moral aspect of his acts, and "settled,"
where the condition is that of delirium tremens. Settled
insanity, in this sense, excuses from civil or criminal
responsibility; temporary insanity does not. The ground
of the distinction is that the former is a remote effect of
imbibing alcoholic liquors and is not voluntarily incurred,
while the latter is a direct result voluntarily sought for.
Evers v. State, 31 Tex.Cr.R. 318, 20 S.W. 744, 18 L.R.A. 421,

494, 495, 13 L.R.A.,N.S., 1024.
Folie brightique. A French term sometimes
used to designate an access of insanity resulting
from nephritis or "Bright's disease." In re Mc-
Kean's Will, 66 N.Y.S. 44, 31 Misc. 703.
Idiopathic insanity is such as results from a dis-
ease of the brain itself, lesions of the cortex, cere-
bral anemia, etc.
Paranoia. A form of mental distress known as
delusionary insanity, and a person afflicted with it
has delusions which dominate, but do not destroy,
the mental capacity, and, though sane as to other
subjects, as to the delusion and its direct conse-
quences the person is insane. Mounger v. Gandy,
110 Miss. 133, 69 So. 817, 818.
It is sometimes characterized as logical perversion, and
is said to have "misplaced the antiquated term monomania,
which not only implied that the delusion was restricted to
one subject, but was otherwise insufficient and misleading."
The memory, emotions, judgment, and conceptions are in
most cases unimpaired, though each of these mental divi-
sions may be involved. 2 Clevenger, Med.Jur. 860. It is
characterized by systematized delusions, the term taking
the place of "monomania" or "partial insanity". Taylor v.
McClintock, 87 Ark. 243, 112 S.W. 405.
Pellagrous insanity. Insanity caused by or de-
rived from pellagra, which is an endemic disease of
southern Europe, (though not confined to that re-
gion,) characterized by erythema, digestive de-
rangement, and nervous affections. (Cent. Dict.)
Polyneuritic insanity. Insanity arising from an
inflammation of the nerves, of the kind called
"polyneuritis" or "multiple neuritis" because it
involves several nerves at the same time. This is
often preceded by tuberculosis and almost always
by alcoholism, and is characterized specially by de-
lusions and falsification of the memory. It is oth-
erwise called "Korssakoff's disease." (Kraepelin.)
Puerperal insanity. A mental derangement oc-
curring in women at the time of child-birth or im-
mediately after; it is also called "eclampsia par-
turientium."
Syphilitic insanity. A paresis or progressive im-
becility resulting from the infection of syphilis.
sult of that disease) "metasyphilis" or "parasyph-
ilis."
Tabetic dementia. A form of mental derange.
ment or insanity complicated with "tabes dorsalis"
or locomotor ataxia, which generally precedes, or
sometimes follows, the mental attack. As to in-
sanity resulting from cerebral embolism, see Em-
bolism; from epilepsy, see Epilepsy. As to chron-
ic alcoholism as a form of insanity, see Alcohol-
ism.
Traumatic insanity is such as results from a
wound or injury, particularly to the head or brain,
such as fracture of the skull or concussion of the
brain.
General Descriptive and Clinical Terms
Affective insanity. A modern comprehensive
term descriptive of all those forms of insanity
which affect or relate to the feelings and emo-
tions and hence to the ethical and social relations
of the individual.
Circular insanity. Another name for maniacal-
depressive insanity, which see.
"Emotional insanity" or mania transitoria ap-
plies to the case of one in the possession of his
ordinary reasoning faculties who allows his pas-
sions to convert him into a temporary maniac.
Mutual L. Ins. Co. v. Terry, 15 Wall. 580, 583, 21
L.Ed. 236.
In a criminal case the law rejects the doctrine of what is
called emotional insanity, which begins on the eve of the
criminal act, and leaves off when it is committed. People
v. Kernaghan, 72 Cal. 609, 14 P. 566, 568; Graves v. State,
45 N.J.L. (16 Vroom) 347, 350, 46 Am.Rep. 778.
Folie circulaire. The French name for circular
insanity or maniacal-depressive insanity.
General paralysis. Dementia paralytica or pa-
resis.
Habitual insanity. Such insanity as is, in its
nature, continuous and chronic. Wright v. Mar-
ket Bank, Tenn.Ch.App., 60 S.W. 623, 624.
Involutional insanity. That which sometimes ac-
companies the "involution" of the physical struc-
ture and physiology of the individual, the reverse
of their "evolution," hence practically equivalent
to the imbecility of old age or senile dementia.
Katatonia. A form of insanity distinguished by
periods of acute mania and melancholia and es-
pecially by cataleptic states or conditions; the
"insanity of rigidity." (Kahlbaum.) A type of
insanity characterized particularly by "stereotyp-
ism," an instinctive inclination to purposeless
repetition of the same expressions of the will, and
"negativism," a senseless resistance against every
outward influence. (Kraepelin.)
Legal insanity. Legal insanity is a disorder of
the intellect, and is distinguished from "moral in-
sanity," which is a disorder of the feelings and
propensities. In re Forman's Will, 54 Barb. 274,
291; Bensberg v. Washington University, 251 Mo.
dering a person incapable of distinguishing be-
tween right and wrong with respect to the offense
charged. State v. Privitt, 175 Mo. 207, 75 S.W. 457,
Maniacal-depressive insanity. A form of insani-
ty characterized by alternating periods of high
maniacal excitement and of depressed and stu-
porous conditions in the nature of or resembling
melancholia, often occurring as a series or cycle of
isolated attacks, with more or less complete re-
storation to health in the intervals. (Kraepelin.)
This is otherwise called "circular insanity" or "cir-
cular stupor."
Moral insanity. A morbid perversion of the feel-
ings, affections, or propensities, but without any
illusions or derangement of the intellectual facul-
ties; irresistible impulse or an incapacity to resist
the prompting of the passions, though accompa-
nied by the power of discerning the moral or im-
moral character of the act. Moral insanity is not
admitted as a bar to civil or criminal responsibility
for the patient's acts, unless there is also shown
to be intellectual disturbance, as manifested by in-
sane delusions or the other recognized criteria of
legal insanity. Taylor v. McClintock, 87 Ark. 243,
112 S.W. 405, 412; Bensberg v. Washington Uni-
versity, 251 Mo. 641, 158 S.W. 330, 336.
In a very few of the states where moral insanity is recog-
nized as a defense, it means an incapacity of resistance, as
where there was an entire destruction of the freedom of the
will, although the person perceived the moral or immoral
character of the act. State v. Leehman, 2 S.D. 171, 49 N.W.
3, 5.
Partial insanity, as a legal term, may mean ei-
ther monomania (see infra) or an intermediate
stage in the development of mental derangement.
In the former sense, it does not relieve the patient
from responsibility for his acts, except where in-
stigated directly by his particular delusion or ob-
session: Trich v. Trich, 165 Pa. 586, 30 A. 1053. In
the latter sense, it denotes a clouding or weaken-
ing of the mind, not inconsistent with some meas-
ure of memory, reason, and judgment. But the
term, in this sense, does not convey any very defi-
nite meaning, since it may range from mere fee-
ble-mindedness to almost the last stages of im-
becility. Appeal of Dunham, 27 Conn. 205; State
v. Jones, 50 N.H. 369, 383, 9 Am.Rep. 242.
Psychoneurosis. Mental disease without recog-
nizable anatomical lesion, and without evidence
and history of preceding chronic mental degenera-
tion. Under this head come melancholia, mania,
primary acute dementia, and mania hallucina-
toria. Cent. Dict.
"Neurosis," in its broadest sense, may include any dis-
ease or disorder of the mind, and hence all the forms of
insanity proper. But the term "psychoneurosis" is now
employed by Freud and other European specialists to
describe that class of exaggerated individual peculiarities
or idiosyncrasies of thought towards special objects or top-
ics which are absent from the perfectly normal mind, and
which yet have so little influence upon the patient's conduct
or his general modes of thought that they cannot properly
be described as "insanity" or as any form of "mania,"
especially because ordinarily unaccompanied by any kind of
delusions. At most, they lie on the debatable border-land
between sanity and insanity. These idiosyncrasies or obses-
sions may arise from superstition, from a real incident in
the patient's past history upon which he has brooded until
it has assumed an unreal importance or significance, or
from general neurasthenic conditions. Such, for example,
are a terrified shrinking from certain kinds of animals,
unreasonable dread of being shut up in some enclosed place
or of being alone in a crowd, excessive fear of being poi-
stoned, groundless conviction of irredeemable sinfulness,
and countless other prepossessions, which may range from
mere weak-minded superstition to actual monomania.
Recurrent insanity. Insanity which returns
from time to time, hence equivalent to "lunacy"
(see supra) in its common-law sense, as a mental
disorder broken by lucid intervals. There is no
presumption that fitful and exceptional attacks of
insanity are continuous. Leache v. State, 22 Tex.
App. 279, 3 S.W. 538, 58 Am.Rep. 638.
Settled insanity. The term applied to delirium
tremens, which is a kind of insanity produced by
alcoholism, caused by the breaking down of the
person's system by long-continued or habitual
drunkenness, and brought on by abstinence from
drink. It is thus termed, to distinguish it from.
"temporary insanity," or drunkenness directly re-
sulting from drink. Evers v. State, 31 Tex.Cr.
R. 318, 20 S.W. 744, 748, 18 L.R.A. 421, 37 Am.St.
Rep. 811.
Temporary delusion. The word implies un-
soundness or derangement of mind or intellect,
not a mere temporary or slight delusion, which
might be occasioned by fever or accident. Karow
v. New York Continental Ins. Co., 57 Wis. 56, 15
N.W. 27, 31, 46 Am.Rep. 17.
Other Forms of Insanity
Amentia, dementia, and mania. The classifica-
tion of insanity into these three types or forms,
though once common, has of late given way to a
more scientific nomenclature, based chiefly on the
origin or cause of the disease in the particular pa-
tient and its clinical history. These terms, how-
ever, are still occasionally encountered in medical
jurisprudence, and the names of some of their
subdivisions are in constant use.
Amentia. A total lack of intelligence, reason,
or mental capacity. Sometimes so used as to cov-
er imbecility or dotage, or even as applicable to
all forms of insanity; but properly restricted to
a lack of mental capacity due to original defective
organization of the brain (idiocy) or arrested cere-
bral development, as distinguished from the degen-
eration of intellectual faculties which once were
normal.
Dementia. A form of insanity resulting from
degeneration or disorder of the brain (idiopathic
or traumatic, but not congenital) and characterized
by general mental weakness and decrepitude, for-
getfulness, loss of coherence, and total inability to
reason, but not accompanied by delusions or un-
controllable impulses. Dennett v. Dennett, 44 N.H.
531, 84 Am.Dec. 97; People v. Lake, 2 Parker, Cr.R.
(N.Y.) 218; Graham v. Deuterman, 91 N.E. 61,
62, 244 Ill. 124; Hibbard v. Baker, 104 N.W. 399,
Among the sub-divisions of dementia should be noticed
the following : Acute primary dementia is a form of tem-
porary dementia, though often extreme in its intensity, and
occurring in young people or adolescents, accompanied by
general physical debility or exhaustion and induced by con-
ditions likely to produce that state, as malnutrition, over-
work, dissipation, or too rapid growth. Dementia paraly-
tica is a progressive form of insanity, beginning with slight
degeneration of the physical, intellectual, and moral pow-
ers, and leading to complete loss of mentality, or imbecil-
ity, with general paralysis. Also called paresis, paretic
dementia, or cirrhosis of the brain, or (popularly) "soften-
ing of the brain." Dementia prcecox. A term applicable
either to the early stages of dementia or to the dementia of
adolescence, but more commonly applied to the latter. It
is often (but not invariably) attributable to onanism or
self-abuse, and is characterized by mental and moral stu-
pidity, absence of any strong feeling of the impressions of
life or interest in its events, blunting or obscuration of
the moral sense, weakness of judgment, flightiness of
thought, senseless laughter without mirth, automatic obedi-
ence, and apathetic despondency. (Kraepelin.) Senile
dementia. Dementia occurring in persons of advanced age,
and characterized by slowness and weakness of the mental
processes and general physical degeneration, verging on or
passing into imbecility, indicating the breaking down of the
mental powers in advance of bodily decay. Hiett v. Shull,
36 W.Va. 563, 15 S.E. 146. Toxic dementia. Weakness
of mind or feeble cerebral activity, approaching imbecili-
ty, resulting from continued administration or use of slow
poisons or of the mere active poisons in repeated small
doses, as in cases of lead poisoning and in some cases of
addiction to such drugs as opium or alcohol.
Dementia praecox paranoid. A medical term in-
dicating that form of dementia in which the pa-
tient exhibits ideas of persecution and has delu-
sions. Rasmussen v. George Benz & Sons, 168 -
Minn. 319, 210 N.W. 75, 76.
Dipsomania. An irresistible impulse to indulge
in intoxication, either alcohol or other drugs-
opiums. This mania, or dipsomania, is classed as
one of the minor forms of insanity. Repeated
intoxication for a number of 'ears, which is en-
tirely voluntary, is not dipsomania. One having
the power to refrain from the use of intoxicants,
and who becomes intoxicated voluntarily, is not
affected with dipsomania. Ballard v. State, 19
Neb. 609, 28 N.W. 271, 273. State v. Reidell, 14
A. 550, 9 Houst. (Del.) 470.
Erotomania. A form of mania similar to nym-
phomania, except that the present term is applied
to patients of both sexes, and that (according to
some authorities) it is applicable to all cases of
excessive sexual craving irrespective of origin;
while nymphomania is restricted to cases where
the disease is caused by a local disorder of the
sexual organs reacting on the brain. In eroto-
mania, there is often an absence of any lesion of
the intellectual powers. Krafft-Ebing, Psycopathia
Sexualis, Chaddock's ed. And it is to be observed
that the term "erotomania" is now often used,
especially by French writers, to describe a morbid
propensity for "falling in love" or an exaggerated
and excited condition of amativeness or love-sick-
ness, which may affect the general physical health,
but is not necessarily correlated with any sexual
craving, and which, though it may unnaturally
color the imagination and distort the subject's
view of life and affairs, does not at all amount
to insanity, and should not be so considered when
it leads to crimes of violence, as in the common
Fit of mania. A fit of mania includes a tern-
porary depression or aberration of the mind,
which sometimes accompanies or follows intoxica-
tion, and is often accompanied by delusions, hallu-
cinations, and illusions. Gunter v. State, 3 So.
600, 607, 83 Ala. 96.
Homicidal mania. A form of mania in which
the morbid state of the mind manifests itself in
an irresistible inclination or impulse to commit
homicide, prompted usually by an insane delusion
either as to the necessity- of self-defense or the
avenging of injuries, or as to the patient being the
appointed instrument of a superhuman justice.
Com. v. Sayre, 5 Wkly. Notes Cas. (Pa.) 425.
Hypomania. A mild or slightly developed form
or type of mania.
Kleptomania. See Kleptomania.
Mania. That form of insanity in which the pa-
tient is subject to hallucinations and illusions, ac-
companied by a high state of general mental ex-
citement, sometimes amounting to fury. Hall v.
Unger, 2 Abb. U. S. 510, 11 Fed.Cas. 261; People
v. Lake, 2 Parker Cr.R., N.Y., 218.
In the case first above cited, the following description Is
given by Justice Field : "Mania is that form of insanity
where the mental derangement is accompanied with more
or less of excitement. Sometimes the excitement amounts
to a fury. The individual in such cases is subject to hal-
lucinations and illusions. He is impressed with the reality
of events which have never occurred, and of things which
do not exist, and acts more or less in conformity with his
belief in these particulars. The mania may be general, and
affect all or most of the operations of the mind ; or it may
be partial, and be confined to particular subjects. In the
latter case it is generally termed 'monomania.' " In a
more popular but less scientific sense, "mania" denotes a
morbid or unnatural or excessive craving, issuing in im-
pulses of such fixity and intensity that they cannot be
resisted by the patient in the enfeebled state of the will and
blurred moral concepts which accompany the disease. It is
used in this sense in such compounds as "homicidal ma-
nia," "dipsomania," and the like.
Mania a potu. Delirium tremens, or a species
of temporary insanity resulting as a secondary
effect produced by the excessive and protracted in-
dulgence in intoxicating liquors. See State v. Hur-
ley, Houst.Cr.Cas. (Del.) 28, 35.
Mania fanatica. A form of insanity character-
ized by a morbid state of religious feeling. Ekin
v. McCracken, 11 Phila., Pa. 540.
Mania transitoria. The term applies to the case
of one in the possession of his ordinary reasoning
faculties, who allows his passions to convert him
into a temporary maniac. Mutual Life Ins. Co. v.
Terry, 82 U.S. (15 Wall.) 580, 583, 21 L.Ed. 236.
Megalomania. The so-called "delirium of gran-
deur" or "folie de grandeur;" a form of mania in
which the besetting delusion of the patient is that
he is some person of great celebrity or exalted
rank, historical or contemporary.
Melancholia. A form of insanity the characteris-
tics of which are extreme mental depression, with
delusions and hallucinations, the latter relating es-
pecially to the financial or social position of the
his person, property, or reputation, or issuing in
distorted conceptions of his relations to society or
his family or of his rights and duties in general.
State v. Reidell, 9 Houst., Del., 470, 14 A. 551; Peo-
ple v. Krist, 168 N.Y. 19, 60 N.E. 1057. Hypochon-
dria or hypochondriasis. A form of melancholia
in which the patient has exaggerated or causeless
fears concerning his health or suffers from imag-
inary disease. Toxiphobia. Morbid dread of be-
ing poisoned; a form of insanity manifesting it-
self by an excessive and unfounded apprehension
of death by poison.
Methomania. An irresistible craving for alcohol-
ic or other intoxicating liquors, manifested by the
periodical recurrence of drunken debauches. State
v. Savage, 89 Ala. 1, 7 So. 183, 7 L.R.A. 426.
Monomania. A perversion of the understanding
in regard to a single object or a small number of
objects, with the predominance of mental excite-
ment, as distinguished from "mania," which
means a condition in which the perversion of the
understanding embraces all kinds of objects, and
is accompanied with general mental excitement.
State v. John, 30 N.C. 330, 337, 49 Am.Dec. 396;
Freed v. Brown, 55 Ind. 310, 317; People v. Lake,
2 Parker, Cr.R. (N.Y.) 215, 218. A perversion or
derangement of the reason or understanding with
reference to a single subject or small class of
subjects, with considerable mental excitement and
delusions, while, as to all matters outside the
range of the peculiar infirmity, the intellectual
faculties remain unimpaired and function normal-
ly. Hopps v. People, 31 Ill. 390, 83 Am.Dec. 231;
Bohler v. Hicks, 120 Ga. 800, 48 S.E. 306, 307.
Necrophilism. A form of affective insanity
manifesting itself in an unnatural and revolting
fondness for corpses, the patient desiring to be in
their presence, to caress them, to exhume them, or
sometimes to mutilate them, and even (in a form
of sexual perversion) to violate them.
Nymphomania. A form of mania characterized
by a morbid, excessive, and uncontrollable craving
for sexual intercourse. This term is applied only
to women. The term for a corresponding mania
in men is "satyriasis."
Oikei mania. A form of insanity manifesting
itself in a morbid state of the domestic affections,
as an unreasonable dislike of wife or child without
cause or provocation. Ekin v. McCracken, 11
Phila. (Pa.) 540.
Paranoia. Monomania in general, or the obses-
sion of a delusion or system of delusions which
dominate without destroying the mental capacity,
leaving the patient sane as to all matters outside
their particular range, though subject to perverted
ideas, false beliefs, and uncontrollable impulses
within that range; and particularly, the form of
monomania where the delusion is as to wrongs, in-
juries, or persecution inflicted upon the patient
and his consequently justifiable resentment or re-
venge. Winters v. State, 61 N.J.L. 613, 41 Atl. 220;
People v. Braun, 158 N.Y. 558, 53 N.E. 529. Para-
tized insanity," because the delusions of being •
wronged or of persecution and of excessive self-
esteem develop quite slowly, without independent
disturbances of emotional life or of the will be-
coming prominent, and because there occurs regu-
larly a mental working up of the delusion to form
a delusionary view of the world,-in fact, a sys-
tem,-leading to a derangement of the stand-point
which the patient takes up towards the events of
life.
Pyromania. Incendiarism; a form of affective
insanity in which the mania takes the form of an
irresistable impulse to burn or set fire to things.
Sebastomania. Religious insanity; demono-
mania.
Toxicomania. An excessive addiction to the use
of toxic or poisonous drugs or other substances-,
a form of mania or affective insanity character-
ized by an irresistible impulse to indulgence in
opium, cocaine, chloral, alcohol, etc.
Specific Definitions and Applications in Law
There are numerous legal proceedings where
insanity may be shown, and the rule for establish-
ing mental capacity or the want of it varies ac-
cording to the object or purpose of the proceeding.
Among these may be enumerated the following:
A criminal prosecution where insanity is alleged
as a defense; a proceeding to defeat a will on the
ground of the insanity of the testator; a suit to
avoid a contract (including that of marriage) for
similar reasons; a proceeding to secure the com-
mitment of a person alleged to be insane to an
asylum; a proceeding to appoint a guardian or
conservator for an alleged lunatic; a plea or pro-
ceeding to avoid the effect of the statute of limita-
tions on account of insanity. What might be re-
garded as insanity in one of such cases would not
necessarily be so regarded in another. No definite
rule can be laid down which would apply to all
cases alike. Snyder v. Snyder, 142 Ill. 60, 31 N.E.
303; Clarke v. Irwin, 63 Neb. 539, 88 N.W. 783.
But the following rules or tests for specific cases
have been generally accepted and approved:
In criminal law and as a defense to an accusa-
tion of crime, insanity means such a perverted
and deranged condition of the mental and moral
faculties as to render the person incapable of dis-
tinguishing between right and wrong, or to render
him at the time unconscious of the nature of the
act he is committing, or such that, though he may
be conscious of it and also of its normal quality,
so as to know that the act in question is wrong,
yet his will or volition has been (otherwise than
voluntarily) so completely destroyed that his ac-
tions are not subject to it but are beyond his con-
trol. Or, as otherwise stated, insanity is such a
state of mental derangement that the subject is
incompetent of having a criminal intent, or incap-
able of so controlling his will as to avoid doing
the act in question. Davis v. U. S., 17 S.Ct. 360,
165 U.S. 373, 41 L.Ed. 750; Doherty v. State, 50 A.
1113, 73 Vt. 380; Butler v. State, 102 Wis. 364, 78
N.W. 590.
An insane person cannot be legally charged
with a criminal intent; State v. Brown, 36 Utah,
46, 102 P. 641, 24 L.R.A.,N.S., 545.
In Coleman's case, in New York it was held that the "test
of the responsibility for criminal acts, when insanity is
asserted, is the capacity of the accused to distinguish
between right and wrong at the time and with respect to
the act which is the subject of inquiry." 1 N.Y.Cr.Rep. 1.
With variations of expression this is the prevailing doctrine
of the American courts. Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Terry, 15
Wall. 590, 21 L.Ed. 236.
The capacity to distinguish between right and wrong has
been held not to be a safe test in all cases. State v. Felter,
25 Iowa 67, per Dillon, C. J. See also Brown v. Corn., 78
Pa. 122.
Insane delusion is of no avail as a defense unless, if true,
the facts supposed to exist would have excused the crime.
Thurman v. State, 32 Neb. 224, 49 N.W. 338; Smith v.
State, 55 Ark. 259, 18 S. W. 237. Irresistible impulse to
commit a crime is defined as that uncontrollable impulse
produced by a disease of the mind, when that disease is
sufficient to override judgment and obliterate the sense of
right as to the acts done, and deprives the accused of power
to choose between them. It was recognized as a defense in
Stevens v. State, 31 Ind. 485, 99 Am. Dec. 634. But it is held
that no impulse, however irresistible, is a defense, where
there is a knowledge as to the particular act between right
and wrong. State v. Brandon, 53 N.C. 463; State v. Miller,
141 Mo. 542, 20 S.W. 243, and that it was a crime morally,
and punishable by the laws of the country; State v. Alex-
ander, 30 S.C. 74, 8 S.E. 440, 14 Am.St.Rep. 879; Williams
v. State, 50 Ark. 511, 9 S.W. 5.
Mere frenzy or ungovernable passion which controls the
will and motives is not insanity sufficient to excuse crime.
Garner v. State, 112 Miss. 317, 73 So. 50, 5L
What is sometimes called moral insanity, as distinguished
from mental unsoundness, is not a defense to a charge of
crime. Flanagan v. People, 52 N.Y. 467, 11 Am.Rep. 731;
Andersen v. State, 43 Conn. 514, 21 Am.Rep. 669; St. Louis
Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Graves, 6 Bush, Ky., 268.
Testamentary capacity includes an intelligent
understanding of the testator's property, its extent
and items, and of the nature of the act he is about
to perform, together with a clear understanding
and purpose as to the manner of its distribution
and the persons who are to receive it. Lacking
these, he is not mentally competent. The presence
of insane delusions is not inconsistent with tes-
tamentary capacity, if they are of such a nature
that they cannot reasonably be supposed to have
affected the dispositions made by the will; and
the same is true of the various forms of mono-
mania and of all kinds of eccentricity and personal
idiosyncrasy. But imbecility, senile dementia, and
all forms of systematized mania which affect the
understanding and judgment generally disable the
patient from making a valid will. Harrison v.
Rowan, 3 Wash. C. C. 585, Fed. Cas. No. 6,141;
Wilson v. Mitchell, 101 Pa. 495; Trustees of Ep-
worth Memorial Methodist Church v. Overman,
185 Ky. 773, 215 S.W. 942, 944. To constitute "se-
nile dementia," incapacitating one to make a will,
there must be such a failure of the mind as to
deprive the testator of intelligent action. Gates
v. Cole, 137 Iowa 613, 115 N.W. 236, 237, 238.
As a ground for avoiding or annulling a contract
or conveyance, insanity does not mean a total de-
privation of reason, but an inability, from defect
of perception, memory, and judgment, to do the
act in question or to understand its nature and
consequences. Frazer v. Frazer, 2 Del. Ch. 260;
Durrett v. McWhorter, 161 Ga. 179, 129 S.E. 870,
874. The insanity must have entered into and in-
duced the particular contract or conveyance; it
must appear that it was not the act of the free
and untrammeled mind, and that on account of
the diseased condition of the mind the person en-
tered into a contract or made a conveyance which
he would not have made if he had been in the pos-
session of his reason. Dewey v. Aligire, 37 Neb.
6, 55 N.W. 276, 40 Am.St.Rep. 468.
Insanity sufficient to justify the annulment of a
marriage means such a want of understanding at
the time of the marriage as to render the party
incapable of assenting to the contract of marriage.
The morbid propensity to steal, called "klepto-
mania," does not answer this description. Lewis
v. Lewis, 44 Minn. 124, 46 N.W. 323, '9 L.R.A. 505,
20 Am.St.Rep. 559. The marriage of a person
insane was held void in Inhabitants of Middlebor-
ough v. Inhabitants of Rochester, 12 Mass. 363.
Powell v. Powell, 18 Kan. 371, 26 Am.Rep. 774;
Waymire v. Jetmore, 22 Ohio St. 271. A marriage
contracted while one party was insane from de-
lirium tremens was held void, but mere weakness
of mind not amounting to derangement is not
sufficient. Rawdon v. Rawdon, 28 Ala. 565 ; and
Vir that merely, or intoxication, a court has no
power to declare a marriage null and void. The
same degree of mental capacity which enables a
person to make a valid deed or will is sufficient
to enable him to marry; Inhabitants of Atkinson
v. Inhabitants of Medford, 46 Me. 510.
Tnsanity is not a defense in an action of tort;
but damages are compensatory and not punitive;
McIntyre v. Sholty, 121 Ill. 660, 13 N.E. 239, 2 Am.
St.Rep. 140. Williams v. Hays, 143 N.Y. 442, 38 N.
E. 449, 26 L.R.A. 153, 42 Am.St.Rep. 743.
One is "insane," so as to make self-destruction
an accident, within the meaning of an insurance
policy compensating death by accident, where he
is so mentally diseased as to be incapable of un-
derstanding the nature of the act and unable to
distinguish between right and wrong. London
Guarantee & Accident Co. v. Officer, 78 Colo. 441,
242 P. 989, 991.
As a ground for restraining the personal liberty
of the patient, it may be said in general that the
form of insanity from which he suffers should
be such as to make his going at large a source of
danger to himself or to others, though this matter
is largely regulated by statute, and in many plac-
es the law permits the commitment to insane asy-
lums and hospitals of persons whose insanity does
not manifest itself in homicidal or other destruc-
tive forms of mania, but who are incapable of
caring for themselves and their property or who
are simply fit subjects for treatment in hospitals
and other institutions specially designed for the
care of such patients.
To constitute insanity such as will authorize the
appointment of a guardian or conservator for the
patient, there must be such a deprivation of rea-
son and judgment as to render him incapable of
understanding and acting with discretion in the
ordinary affairs of life; a want of sufficient men-
tal capacity to transact ordinary business and to
take care of and manage his property and affairs.
See Snyder v. Snyder, 142 Ill. 60, 31 N.E. 303.
Insanity as a plea or proceeding to avoid the
effect of the statute of limitations means prac-
tically the same thing as in relation to the appoint-
ment of a guardian. On the one hand, it does not
require a total deprivation of reason or absence
of understanding. On the other hand, it does not
include mere weakness of mind short of imbecility.
It means such a degree of derangement as renders
the subject incapable of understanding the nature
of the particular affair and his rights and reme-
dies in regard to it and incapable of taking dis-
creet and intelligent action. Burnham v. Mitchell,
34 Wis. 134. The time of sanity required in order
to allow the statute to begin to run is such as will
enable the party to examine his affairs and insti-
tute an action, and is for the jury.
There are a few other legal rights or relations
into which the question of insanity enters, such
as the capacity of a witness or of a voter; but
they are governed by the same general principles.
The test is capacity to understand and appreciate
the nature of the particular act and to exercise
intelligence in its performance. A witness must
understand the nature and purpose of an oath and
have enough intelligence and memory to relate
correctly the facts within his knowledge. So a
voter must understand the nature of the act to be
performed and be able to make an intelligent
choice of candidates. In either case, eccentricity,
"crankiness," feeble-mindedness not amounting to
imbecility, or insane delusions which do not affect
the matter in hand, do not disqualify. See Dis-
trict of Columbia v. Armes, 2 S.Ct. 840, 107 U.S.
521, 27 L.Ed. 618.

be sufficient to discharge the latter. Or the con-
dition of a person who is unable to pay his debts
as they fall due, or in the usual course of trade
and business. Dewey v. St. Albans Trust Co., 56
Vt. 475, 48 Am.Rep. 803; Toof v. Martin, 13 Wall.
47, 20 L.Ed. 481; Frank v. Stearns, 111 Neb. 101,
195 N.W. 949, 951.
Independent of statute, it may generally be said that

become due in the usual course of business. Parker v. First
Nat. Bank, 96 Okl. 70, 220 P. 39; Bushman v. Bushman,
311 Mo. 551, 279 S.W. 122, 126. The mere fact that a corpo-
ration or an individual is unable to pay its debts upon a

Co. v. McMinnville Motor Car Co., 111 Or. 123, 225 P. 314,
317, and a bank is not "insolvent" if its assets are sufficient
to meet its obligations within a reasonable time, although

Pelham v. Chattahoochee Grocery Co., 156 Ala. 500, 47 So.
Under Bankr.Act July 1, 1898, c. 541, § 1, cl. 19, as
amended, (formerly 15), 30 Stat. 544 (11 U.S.C.A. § 1), and
section 3a, cl. 4, as amended, (11 U.S.C.A. § 44), a person
shall be deemed insolvent within the provisions of the act
whenever the aggregate of his property, exclusive of any
property which he may have conveyed, transferred, con-
cealed, removed, or permitted to be concealed or removed,
with intent to defraud, hinder, or delay his creditors, shall
not at a fair valuation be sufficient in amount to pay his
debts. In re Wm. S. Butler Co., C.C.A.Mass., 207 F. 705,
709; Anderson v. Myers, C.C.A.Fla., 296 F. 101, 103; Moun-
tain States Power Co. v. A. L. Jordan Lumber Co., C.C.A.

As to the distinction between bankruptcy and insolvency,
see Bankruptcy.
Commercial Insolvency. See that title.
Insolvency fund. In English law. A fund, con-
sisting of moneys and securities, which, at the time
of the passing of the bankruptcy act, 1861, stood,
in the Bank of England, to the credit of the com-
missioners of the insolvent debtors' court, and
was, by the twenty-sixth section of that act, di-
rected to be carried by the bank to the account of
the accountant in bankruptcy. Provision has now
been made for its transfer to the commissioners
for the reduction of the national debt. Robs.
Insolvency laws. Insolvency laws are generally
statutory provisions by which the property of the
debtor is surrendered for his debts; and upon this
condition, and the assent of a certain proportion
of his creditors, he is discharged from all further
liabilities; Bartlet v. Prince, 9 Mass. 431; Otis v.
Warren, 16 Mass. 53; 2 Kent 321; Ingr. Insolv.
9. Insolvency, according to some of the state
statutes, may be of two kinds, voluntary and in-
voluntary. Voluntary insolvency is the case in
which the debtor institutes the proceedings, and is
desirous of availing himself of the insolvent laws,
and petitions for that purpose whereas involun-
tary insolvency is where the proceedings are in-
stituted by the creditors in invitum, and so the
debtor forced into insolvency.
Open insolvency. The condition of one who has
no property, within the reach of the law, applica-
ble to the payment of any debt. Hardesty v. Kin-
worthy, 8 Blackf. (Ind.) 305; Somerby v. Brown,
73 Ind. 356.

beck, 9 N.Y. 589. One who cannot or does not pay;
one who is unable to pay his debts; one who is not
solvent; one who has not means or property suf-
ficient to pay his debts. One who is unable to pay
commercial paper in the due course of business.

P. 970; or the embarrassment is only temporary, Langham
v. Lanier, 7 Tex.Civ.App. 4, 26 S.W. 255; but it is held
that mere inability to pay debts promptly as they mature is
not conclusive, Mensing v. Atchison, Tex.Civ.App., 26 S.W.
509; and that one who has sufficient property subject to
legal process to satisfy all legal demands is not insolvent.
Smith v. Collins, 94 Ala. 394, 10 So. 334. A corporation is
insolvent when its assets are insufficient for the payment of
its debts, and it has ceased to do business, or has taken, or
is in the act of taking, a step which will practically inca-
pacitate it from conducting the corporate enterprise with
reasonable prospect of success, or its embarrassments are
such that early suspension and failure must ensue. Corey
v. Wadsworth, 99 Ala. 68, 11 So. 350, 23 L.R.A. 618, 42
Am.St.Rep. 29. A bank is insolvent when the cash value of
its assets realizable in a reasonable time is not equal to its
liabilities exclusive of stock liabilities. Ellis v. State, 138

A mode of trial for-
merly in use in England, by which the judges of
a court decided a point in dispute, upon the tes-
timony of their own senses, without the interven-

adopted for the greater expedition of a cause. 3
Bl.Comm. 331.

it verbatim; it then grants such further privi-
leges as are thought convenient. 5 Co. 54.

has no proper application to admiralty courts in
the United States, where the powers of both in-
stance and prize courts are conferred without any
distinction. 3 Kent, Comm. 355, 378; The Betsey,
3 Da11. 6, 1 L.Ed. 485; The Emulous, 1 Gall. 563,

fore the court of appellate jurisdiction; and the
third instance, "tercera instancia," is the prosecu-
tion of the same suit, either by an application of
revision before the appellate tribunal that has al-
ready decided the cause, or before some higher
tribunal, having jurisdiction of the same. Es-
criche.

with; without delay. Trial instanter was had
where a prisoner between attainder and execution
pleaded that he was not the same who was at-
tainted.

must plead the same day. The term is usually un-
derstood to mean within twenty-four hours. Fent-
ress v. State, 16 Tex.App. 83; Champlin v. Champ-
lin, 2 Edw.Ch., N.Y., 329.

## INSTITUTES

A name sometimes given to text-
books containing the elementary principles of
jurisprudence, arranged in an orderly and sys-
tematic manner. For example, the Institutes of
Justinian, of Gaius, of Lord Coke.
Institutes of Gaius. An elementary work of the
Roman jurist Gaius; important as having formed
the foundation of the Institutes of Justinian,
(q. v.). These Institutes were discovered by Nie-
buhr in 1816, in a codex rescriptus of the library of
the cathedral chapter at Verona, and were first
published at Berlin in 1820. Two editions have
since appeared. Mackeld.Rom.Law, § 54.
Institutes of Justinian. One of the four compo-
nent parts or principal divisions of the Corpus Ju-
ris Civilis, being an elementary treatise on the
Roman law, in four books. This work was com-
piled from earlier sources, (resting principally on
the Institutes of Gaius,) by a commission com-
posed of Tribonian and two others, by command
and under direction of the emperor Justinian,
and was first published November 21, A. D. 533.
Institutes of Lord Coke. The name of four vol-
umes by Lord Coke, published A. D. 1628. The
first is an extensive comment upon a treatise on
tenures, compiled by Littleton, a judge of the
common pleas, temp. Edward IV. This comment
is a rich mine of valuable common-law learning,
collected and heaped together from the ancient re-
ports and Year Books, but greatly defective in
method. It is usually cited by the name of "Co.
Litt," or as "1 Inst." The second volume is a
comment upon old acts of parliament, without
systematic order; the third a more methodical
treatise on the pleas of the crown; and the fourth
an account of the several species of courts.
These are cited as 2, 3, or 4 "Inst.," without any
author's name. Wharton.
Theophilus' Institutes. A paraphrase of Justini-
an, made, it is believed, soon after A. D. 533.
This paraphrase maintained itself as a manual of
law until the eighth or tenth century. This text
was used in the time of Hexabiblos of Harmenipu-
lus, the last of the Greek jurists. It is also con-
jectured that Theophilus was not the editor of his
own paraphrase, but that it was drawn up by some
of his pupils after his explanations and lectures, in-
asmuch as it contains certain barbarous phrases,
and the texts of the manuscripts vary greatly from
each other.
INSTITUTIO II1EREDIS. Lat. In Roman law.
The appointment of the hcvres in the will. It cor-
responds very nearly to the nomination of an ex-
ecutor in English law. Without such an appoint-
ment the will was void at law, but the prcetor
(i. e., equity) would, under certain circumstances,
carry out the intentions of the testator. Brown.

## INSTITUTION

The commencement or inaugura-
tion of anything. The first establishment of a law,
rule, rite, etc. Any custom, system, organization,
etc., firmly established. An elementary rule or

ter or one affecting a community. State v. Clau-
sen, 85 Wash. 260, 148 P. 28, 32, Ann.Cas.1916B, 810.

tion. It may be private in its character, designed
for profit to those composing the organization, or
public and charitable in its purposes. In re Pea-
body's Estate, 21 Cal.App.2d 690, 70 P.2d 249, 250.
A foundation; as, a literary or charitable institu-
tion. Prescott Courier v. Board of Sup'rs of Yava-
pai County, 49 Ariz. 423, 67 P.2d 483, 486.
The term "institution" is sometimes used as descriptive
of an establishment or place where the business or opera-
tions of a society or association is carried on; at other
times it is used to designate the organized body. Benjamin
Rose Institute v. Myers, 92 Ohio St. 252, 110 N.E. 924, 926,
927, L.R.A.1916D, 1170; Bartling v. Walt, 96 Neb. 532, 148
N.W. 507, 509.
Ecclesiastical Law
A kind of investiture of the spiritual part of
the benefice, as induction is of the temporal; for
by institution the care of the souls of the parish
is committed to the charge of the clerk. Brown.
Civil Law
The appointment of an heir; the act by which
a testator nominates one or more persons to suc-
ceed him in all his rights active and passive. Hali-
fax, Anal. 39; Pothier, Tr. des Donations testa-
mentaires, c. 2, s. 1, § 1; La Civ.Code, art. 1598

cover damages for trespass.
Political Law

by law or the authority of individuals, for promot-
ing any object, public or social. Dodge v. Wil-
liams, 46 Wis. 70, 1 N.W. 92, 50 N.W. 1103; State
v. Edmondson, 88 Ohio St. 625, 106 N.E. 41, 44.
A system or body of usages, laws, or regula-
tions, of extensive and recurring operation, con-
taining within itself an organism by which it ef-
fects its own independent action, continuance, and
generally its own further development. Its object
is to generate, effect, regulate, or sanction a suc-
cession of acts, transactions, or productions of a
peculiar kind or class. We are likewise in the hab-
it of calling single laws or usages "institutions,"
if their operation is of vital importance and vast
scope, and if their continuance is in a high degree
independent of any interfering power. Lieb. Civil
Lib. 300.
General
Public institution. One which is created and
exists by law or public authority, e. g., an asylum,

## INSURANCE

A contract whereby, for a stipu-
lated consideration, one party undertakes to com-
pensate the other for loss on a specified subject by
specified perils. The party agreeing to make the
compensation is usually called the "insurer" or
"underwriter;" the other, the "insured" or "as-
sured;" the agreed consideration, the "premium;"
the written contract, a "policy;" the events in-
sured against, "risks" or "perils;" and the subject,
right, or interest to be protected, the "insurable in-
terest." 1 Phil.Ins. §§ 1-5. A contract whereby

in some states it means insurance against acci-
dental injuries to property, as distinguished from
accidents resulting in bodily injury or death, Em-
404, 29 N.E. 529.
Commercial insurance is a term applied to in-
demnity agreements, in the form of insurance
bonds or policies, whereby parties to commercial
contracts are to a designated extent guarantied
against loss by reason of a breach of contractual
obligations on the part of the other contracting
party; to this class belong policies of contract
credit and title insurance. Cowles v. Guaranty
Co., 32 Wash. 120, 72 Pac. 1032, 98 Am.St.Rep.
Employers' insurance. Employers' insurance
policies are of two sorts, the "liability" contract,
which obligates the insurer to pay the loss without
first requiring that the assured do so, and the
"indemnity" contract, which obligates the insurer
to reimburse only after the employer has paid the
debt to the injured employee. Davies v. Maryland

dent insurance furnished by a fraternal beneficial
association, consisting in the undertaking to pay
to a member, or his heirs in case of death, a stip-
ulated sum of money, out of funds raised for that

by all the members of the association.
Guaranty or fidelity insurance is a contract
whereby one, for a consideration, agrees to indem-
nify another against loss arising from the want of
integrity or fidelity of employees and persons hold-
ing positions of trust, or embezzlements by them,
or against the insolvency of debtors, losses in

Fidelity & Guaranty Co., 32 Wash. 120, 72 P. 1032.
Indemnity insurance. This term has come to
have a well defined and recognized meaning in
insurance parlance, and is applied to contracts
which provide indemnity against loss, and not the
contracts which provide for indemnity against lia-
bility. The latter are known as liability contracts
or policies, and the former as indemnity contracts
or policies. 44 C.J.S. pp. 480, 482. As applied to
motor vehicles, the distinctions between the two
types of policies are discussed in Blashfield, Cyc. of
Automobile Law and Prac., Perm. Ed., §§ 4011-
Industrial insurance. Small policies issued in
consideration of weekly premium payments. Life
& Casualty Ins. Co. v. King, 137 Tenn. 685, 195
S.W. 585, 588.
Liability insurance is that form of insurance
which indemnifies against liability on account of
injuries to the person or property of another. It
is distinguished from "indemnity insurance" (see
that title, supra), and may be issued to cover the
liability of, for example, carriers, contractors, em-
ployers, landlords, manufacturers, owners, and
railroads. Liability insurance may extend to au-
tomobiles, elevators, fly wheels, libel, theaters, and

prescribed term, or, according to the contract,
whenever it occurs) the insurer engages to pay
a stipulated sum to the legal representatives of
such person, or to a third person having an in-
surable interest in the life of such person.
Straight life insurance or whole life insurance is insur-
ance for which premiums are collected so long as the
insured may live, whereas, term insurance is insurance
which promises payment only within a stipulated number
of years. Doty v. American Nat. Ins. Co., 350 Mo. 192, 165
S.W.2d 862, 869, 143 A.L.R. 1062.

indemnify him against some or all of those risks
during a certain period or voyage. 1 Phil.Ins. 1.
A contract whereby one party, for a stipulated pre-
mium, undertakes to indemnify the other against
certain perils or sea-risks to which his ship,
freight, and cargo, or some of them, may be ex-
posed during a certain voyage, or a fixed period of
time. An insurance against risks connected with
navigation, to which a ship, cargo, freightage,
profits, or other insurable interest in movable prop-
erty may be exposed during a certain voyage or a
fixed period of time. Civ.Code Cal. § 2655.
Motor vehicle insurance. See Automobile in-
surance, supra.
Old line life insurance. Insurance on a level or
fiat rate plan where, for a fixed premium payable
without condition at stated intervals, a certain
sum is to be paid upon death without condition.

Title insurance. Insurance against loss or dam-
age resulting from defects or failure of title to a
particular parcel of realty, or from the enforce-
ment of liens existing against it at the time of the
insurance. This form of insurance is taken out by
a purchaser of the property or one loaning money
on mortgage, and is furnished by companies spe-
cially organized for the purpose, and which keep
complete sets of abstracts or duplicates of the rec-
ords, employ expert title-examiners, and prepare
conveyances and transfers of all sorts. A "certifi-
cate of title" furnished by such a company is mere-
ly the formally expressed professional opinion of
the company's examiner that the title is complete
and perfect (or otherwise, as stated), and the
company is liable only for a want of care, skill, or
diligence on the part of its examiner; whereas an
"insurance of title" warrants the validity of the ti-
tle in any and all events. It is not always easy
to distinguish between such insurance and a "guar-
anty of title" given by such a company, except that
in the former case the maximum limit of liability
is fixed by the policy, while In the latter case the
undertaking is to make good any and all loss re-
sulting from defect or failure of the title.
Tornado insurance. Insurance against injuries
to crops, timber, houses, farm buildings, and other
property from the effects of tornadoes, hurricanes,
and cyclones.
Other Compound and Descriptive Terms
Additional insurance. To constitute prohibited
"additional insurance" both policies must be on
same subject-matter and on same interest therein.

Assessment life insurance policy. A contract by
which payments to insured are not unalterably
fixed, but dependent on collection of assessments
necessary to pay amounts insured, while an "old-
line policy" unalterably fixes premiums and defi-
nitely and unchangeably fixes insurer's liability.
Clark v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 126 Me. 7, 135
A. 357, 358.
Comprehensive coverage. A simple and con-
venient form of indemnity now commonly avail-
able in contracts of automobile insurance. It in-
cludes not only the conventional coverages against
loss caused by fire, theft, wind, water, or malicious
mischief, but is generally designed to protect
collision or upset. Blashfield, Cyc. of Automobile
Law and Prac., Perm. Ed., § 3653. Among losses
commonly incurred and paid under comprehensive
policies are those caused by lighted cigarettes.
Other examples of such losses include scratching
of the finish by matches, thorns, or dust storms;
damage to the upholstery caused by a child's loss
of control of the urinary function, and by the
clawing or chewing of the upholstery by a pet
dog; and damage to the fenders resulting when a
goat mistook them for hors d'oeuvres. Appleman,
Ins. Law and Prac., § 3222.

tionately the loss happening within the provisions
of both policies. Rubber Co. v. Assur. Co., 64 N.J.
L. 580, 46 A. 777; Connecticut Fire Ins. Co. v.
Union Mercantile Co., 161 Ky. 718, 171 S.W. 407,

General and special insurance. In marine in-
surance a general insurance is effected when the
perils insured against are such as the law would
imply from the nature of the contract considered
in itself and supposing none to be specified in the
policy; in the case of special insurance, further
perils (in addition to implied perils) are expressed
in the policy. Vandenheuvel v. United Ins. Co., 2
Johns.Cas. (N.Y.) 127.

such broker. Broker is agent for insured though
at same time for some purposes he may be agent

Va. 349, 175 S.E. 763.
An "insurance agent" is tied to his company, whereas an
"insurance broker" is an independent middleman not tied

the parties insured, or in other words, one in which
all persons insured become members of the as-
sociation and contribute either cash or assessable
premium notes, or both, to a common fund, out of
which each is entitled to indemnity in case of loss.

organized according to the usual form of business
corporations, having a capital stock divided into
shares, which, with current income and accumu-
lated surplus, constitutes the fund for the payment
of losses, policy-holders paying fixed premiums and
not being members of the association unless they
also happen to be stockholders.

It is distinguishable from all other forms of
insurance, in that every insured is interinsurer,
and every insurer is insured. Underwriters' Ex-
185 N.E. 504, 506.
Mutual insurance. That form of insurance pro-
vided by mutual companies. An essential char-
acteristic of a mutual insurance company is col-
lective and entire ownership and control by its
members, all of whom must be policyholders. A
mutual company may collect cash premiums from
members in advance or it may assess members to
pay losses and overhead. An insurance company
can be mutual even though policyholders are not
subject to assessment. To be a mutual insurance
company, it is also essential that the company
provide insurance to its members substantially at
cost. Ohio Farmers indemnity Co. v. Commission-
er of Internal Revenue, 108 F.2d 665; Union Ins.

though extralegal, may be just and timely in itself ; as
where it is undertaken for the overthrow of tyranny or the
reform of gross abuses.

## INSURRECTION

A rebellion, or rising of citi-
zens or subjects in resistance to their government

state to integrate the bar, or by rule of court in
the exercise of its inherent power. Integration
of Bar Case, 244 Wis. 8, 11 N.W.2d 604, 608, 151

homa, 185 Okl. 505, 95 P.2d 113.
Integrated Bar
"The integrated bar movement was initiated in this
country about 35 years ago [i. e., about 1914] by the
American Judicature Society and since that time at least
27 States have adopted it. None of them have returned
to the old system of voluntary organization, but all
commend the integrated bar highly. * * * When we
say the bar is integrated we mean that every lawyer with-
in a given area has membership in a cohesive organiza-
tion. An organization of less than all the members of the
bar in a given area would not be an integrated bar. The
area may be the state, the county, or the city. The
integrated bar has also been defined as the process by
which every member of the bar is given an opportunity to
do his part in performing the public service expected of
him, and by which each member is obliged to bear his
portion of the responsibility. * * * The integrated bar
of California has promulgated the best pattern for an in-
tegrated bar program to which our attention has been.
directed." Terrell, J., writing for a majority of the Su-
preme Court of Florida on the Petition of Florida State
Bar Ass'n (1949), 40 So.2d 902, 904.

## INTEGRITY

As occasionally used in statutes pre-
scribing the qualifications of public officers, trus-
tees, etc., this term means soundness of moral
principle and character, as shown by one person
dealing with others in the making and perform-
ance of contracts, and fidelity and honesty in the
discharge of trusts; it is synonymous with "pro-
bity," "honesty," and "uprightness." In re Bau-
quier's Estate, 88 Cal. 302, 26 Pac. 178; In re Gor-
don's Estate, 142 Cal. 125, 75 Pac. 672.

## INTELLIGIBILITY

In pleading. The statement
of matters of fact directly (excluding the necessity
of inference or argument to arrive at the mean-
ing) and in such appropriate terms, so arranged,
as to be comprehensible by a person of common
or ordinary understanding. Davis v. Trump, 43
W.Va. 191, 27 S.E. 397, 64 Am.St.Rep. 849.

ments of the United States government, as, "in-
tendant of marine," "intendant of finance."
The term was also used in Alabama to designate
the chief executive officer of a city or town, hav-
ing practically the same duties and functions as
a mayor. Const. Ala. 1901, § 176; Intendant and
Council of Greensboro v. Mullins, 13 Ala. 341,
INTENDED TO BE RECORDED. This phrase is
frequently used in conveyances, when reciting
some other conveyance which has not yet been
recorded, but which forms a link in the chain of

a covenant, on the part of the grantor, to procure
the deed to be recorded in a reasonable time.
Penn v. Preston, 2 Rawle (Pa.) 14.

F.2d 837, 840, 70 App.D.C. 316, 125 A.L.R. 1031;
being a state of mind, is rarely susceptible of
direct proof, but must ordinarily be inferred from
the facts. State v. Walker, 109 W.Va. 351, 154 S.
E. 866, 867. It presupposes knowledge. Reinhard
v. Lawrence Warehouse Co., 41 Cal.App.2d 741, 107
P.2d 501, 504.
"Intent" and "motive" are not in law one and the same
thing. State v. Logan, 344 Mo. 351, 126 S.W.2d 256, 260,
122 A.L.R. 417. "Intent" in legal sense is purpose to use
particular means to effect certain result; whereas, "mo-
tive" is reason which leads minds to desire that result.
United Fidelity Life Ins. Co. v. Adair, Tex.Civ.App., 29
S.W.2d 940, 943.
"Intent" expresses mental action at its most advanced
point, or as it actually accompanies an outward, corporal
act which has been determined on. Intent shows the pres-
ence of will in the act which consummates a crime. It is
the exercise of intelligent will, the mind being fully aware

of a testator's intention.

## INTENTIO INSERVIRE DEBET LEGIBUS, NON LEGES INTENTIONI

Hob. 123. My intent gives a name to my act.

## INTENTION

Determination to act in a certain
way or to do a certain thing. State ex rel. Verbon
v. County of St. Louis, 216 Minn. 140, 12 N.W.2d
193, 196; In re McCafferty's Will, 254 N.Y.S. 789,
795, 142 Misc. 371. Meaning; will; purpose; de-
sign. 4 Kent, Comm. 534.
"Intention," when used with reference to the construc-
tion of wills and other documents, means the sense and
meaning of it, as gathered from the words used therein.
Parol evidence is not ordinarily admissible to explain this.
When used with reference to civil and criminal responsi-
bility, a person who contemplates any result, as not
unlikely to follow from a deliberate act of his own, may be
said to intend that result, whether he desire it or not.
Thus, if a man should, for a wager, discharge a gun among
a multitude of people, and any should be killed, he would
be deemed guilty of intending the death of such person;
for every man is presumed to intend the natural conse-
quence of his own actions. Intention is often confounded
with motive, as when we speak of a man's "good inten-
tions." Mozley & Whitley.

144 Fla. 187, 197 So. 833, 835.

as in a question with creditors, to be null and of
no avail. Conjunct persons are those standing in
a certain degree of relationship to each other;
such, for example, as brothers, sisters, sons,
uncles, etc. These were formerly excluded as
witnesses, on account of their relationship; but
this, as a ground of exclusion, has been abolished.

## INTER REGALIA

In English law. Among the
things belonging to the sovereign. Among these
are rights of salmon fishing, mines of gold and
silver, forests, forfeitures, casualties of superior-

another is called a "gift inter vivos," to distin-
guish it from a donation made in contemplation
of death, (mortis causa.)

furnish them with meat, drink, house, harbor, or
any other things useful or comfortable; or to
have any intercourse with them whatever,—under
pain of being reputed art and part in their crimes,
and dealt with accordingly; and desiring all sher-
iffs, bailies, etc., to apprehend and commit such
rebels to prison. Bell.

## INTERCOURSE

standing alone, and without a descriptive or qual-
ifying word, does not import sexual connection.
People v. Howard, 143 Cal. 316, 76 P. 1116.

## INTERDICT

In Roman law. A decree of the
praetor by means of which, in certain cases de-
termined by the edict, he himself directly com-
manded what should be done or omitted, partic-
ularly in causes involving the right of possession
or a quasi possession. In the modern civil law,
interdicts are regarded precisely the same as ac-
tions, though they give rise to a summary pro-
ceeding. Mackeld. Rom. Law, § 258.
Interdicts are either prohibitory, restorative, or
exhibitory; the first being a prohibition, the sec-
ond a decree for restoring possession lost by force,
the third a decree for the exhibiting of accounts,
etc. Heinec. § 1206.
An interdict was distinguished from an "action," (actio,)
properly so called, by the circumstance that the praetor
himself decided in the first instance, (principaliter,) on the
application of the plaintiff, without previously appointing a
judex, by issuing a decree commanding what should be
done, or left undone. Gaius, 4, 139. It might be adopted
as a remedy in various cases where a regular action could
not be maintained, and hence interdicts were at one time
more extensively used than were the actiones themselves.
Afterwards, however, they fell into disuse, and in the
time of Justinian were generally dispensed with. Mackeld.
Rom. Law, § 258; Inst. 4, 15, 8.
In Ecclesiastical law. An ecclesiastical censure,
by which divine services are prohibited to be ad-
ministered either to particular persons or in par-
ticular places.
In Scotch law. An order of the court of session
or of an inferior court, pronounced on cause
shown, for stopping any act or proceedings com-
plained of as illegal or wrongful. It may be re-
sorted to as a remedy against any encroachment
either on property or possession, and is a protec-
tion against any unlawful proceeding. Bell.

## INTERDICTION

In French law. Every person
who, on account of insanity, has become incapable
of controlling his own interests, can be put under
the control of a guardian, who shall administer
his affairs with the same effect as he might him-
self. Such a person is said to be "interdit," and
his status is described as "interdiction." Arg. Fr.
Merc. Law, 562.
In the Civil law. A judicial decree, by which a
person is deprived of the exercise of his civil
rights.
In French-Canadian law. A proceeding institut-
ed for the purpose of obtaining a curator of the
person and property, and includes the calling of
a family council and a petition to the court or its
prothonotary, followed by a hearing. In re Meth-
ot's Will, 98 A. 839, 840, 87 N.J.Eq. 256.
In International law. An "interdiction of com-
mercial intercourse" between two countries is a
governmental prohibition of commercial inter-
course, intended to bring about an entire cessa-
tion for the time being of all trade whatever. The
Edward, 1 Wheat. 272, 4 L.Ed. 86.

## INTERDICTION OF FIRE AND WATER

ishment by an order that no man should supply
the person banished with fire or water, the two
necessaries of life.

## INTERDICTUM SALVIANUM

Lat. In Roman
law. The Salvian interdict. A process which /ay
for the owner of a farm to obtain possession of
the goods of his tenant who had pledged them to

## PRIMA FACIE JUSTA VIDETUR, TAMEN IN- IQUE NOCEAT

It sometimes happens that a
plea which seems prima facie just, nevertheless
is injurious and unequal. Inst. 4, 14, 1, 2.
INTERESSE, Lat. Interest. The interest of
money; also an interest in lands.
Interesse termini. An interest in a term. That
species of interest or property which a lessee for
years acquires in the lands demised to him, before
he has actually become possessed of those lands;
as distinguished from that property or interest
vested in him by the demise, and also reduced into
possession by an actual entry upon the lands and
the assumption of ownership therein, and which
is then termed an "estate for years." Brown.
Pro interesse suo. For his own interest; ac-
cording to, or to the extent of, his individual in-
terest. Used (in practice) to describe the inter-
vention of a party who comes into a suit for the
purpose of protecting interests of his own which
may be involved in the dispute between the prin-
cipal parties or which may be affected by the
settlement of their contention.
INTEREST.
Property
The most general term that can be employed to
denote a property in lands or chattels. In its ap-
plication to lands or things real, it is frequently
used in connection with the terms "estate,"
"right," and "title," and, according to Lord Coke,
it properly includes them all. Co. Litt. 345b.
State v. McKellop, 40 Mo. 185; Loventhal v. Home
Ins. Co., 20 So. 419, 112 Ala. 116, 33 L.R.A. 258, 57
Am.St.Rep. 17.
More particularly it means a right to have the
advantage accruing from anything; any right in
the nature of property, but less than title; a par-
tial or undivided right; a title to a share.
The terms "interest" and "title" are not synonymous. A
mortgagor in possession, and a purchaser holding under a
deed defectively executed, have, both of them, absolute as
well as insurable interests in the property, though neither
of them has the legal title. Hough v. City F. Ins. Co., 29
Conn. 20, 76 Am.Dec. 581.
Absolute or conditional. That is an absolute in-
terest in property which is so completely vested
in the individual that he can by no contingency be
deprived of it without his own consent. So, too,
he is the owner of such absolute interest who
must necessarily sustain the loss if the property
is destroyed. The terms "interest" and "title" are
not synonymous. A mortgagor in possession, and
a purchaser holding under a deed defectively exe-
cuted, have, both of them, absolute, as well as in-
surable, interests in the property, though neither
of them has the legal title. "Absolute" is here
synonymous with "vested," and is used in contra-
distinction to contingent or conditional. Hough v.
City F. Ins. Co., 29 Conn. 10, 76 Am.Dec. 581;
Garver v. Hawkeye Ins. Co., 69 Iowa 202, 28 N. W.
555; Washington F. Ins. Co. v. Kelly, 32 Md. 421,
431, 3 Am.Rep. 149; Elliott v. Ashland Mut. F. Ins.
Co., 12 A. 676, 117 Pa. 548, 2 Am.St.Rep. 703.
Interest or no interest. These words, inserted
in an insurance policy, mean that the question
whether the insured has or has not an insurable
interest in the subject-matter is waived, and the
policy is to be good irrespective of such interest.
The effect of such a clause is to make it a wager
policy.
Interest policy. One which actually, or prima
facie, covers a substantial and insurable interest;
as opposed to a wager policy.
English Law
Interest suit. An action in the probate branch
of the high court of justice, in which the question
in dispute is as to which party is entitled to a
grant of letters of administration of the estate
of a deceased person. Wharton.
General
Joint interest. One owned by several persons
in equal shares by a title created by a single will
or transfer, when expressly declared in the will or
transfer to be a joint tenancy, or when granted or
devised to executors or trustees as joint tenants.
Civ. Code Cal. § 683.
Law of Evidence
"Interest," in a statute that no witness shall be
excluded by interest in the event of the suit, means
"concern," "advantage," "good," "share," "por-
tion," "part," or "participation." Morgan v. John-
son, 87 Ga. 382, 13 S.E. 710.
A relation to the matter in controversy, or to the
issue of the suit, in the nature of a prospective
gain or loss, which actually does, or presumably
might, create a bias or prejudice in the mind, in-
clining the person to favor one side or the other.
For Money
Interest is the compensation allowed by law or
fixed by the parties for the use or forbearance or
detention of money. Beach v. Peabody, 188 Ill. 75,
58 N.E. 680, Shealy v. U. S., D.C.S.C., 37 F.2d 918,
Conventional interest is interest at the rate
agreed upon and fixed by the parties themselves,
as distinguished from that which the law would
prescribe in the absence of an explicit agreement.
Fowler v. Smith, 2 Cal. 568; Vernon's Ann. Civ.
St. art. 5069.
Legal interest. See Legal Interest.
Simple interest is that which is paid for the
principal or sum lent, at a certain rate or allow-
ance, made by law or agreement of parties.
Compound interest is interest upon interest,
where accrued interest is added to the principal
sum, and the whole treated as a new principal, for
the calculation of the interest for the next period.
Ex-interest. In the language of stock exchang
es, a bond or other interest-bearing security is
said to be sold "ex-interest" when the vendor r
serves to himself the interest already accrued an
payable (if any) or the interest accruing up to th
next interest day.
Interest, maritime. See Maritime Interest.
Interest upon interest. Compound interest.

INTERFERENCE. In patent law, this term de
ignates a collision between rights claimed or gra

by the patent office whenever it is decided by the properly
constituted authority in that bureau that -two pending
applications (or a patent and a pending application), in
their claims or essence, cover the same discovery or inven-
tion, so as to render necessary an investigation into the
question of priority of invention between the two applica-
tions or the application and the patent, as the case may be.

of different nations, tribes, families, etc., as, be-
tween the sovereigns of two different countries,
between an American and an alien, between In-
dians of different tribes, between the scions of
different clans or families. But, in law, it is some-
times used (and with propriety) to emphasize the
mutuality of the marriage contract and as import-
ing a reciprocal engagement by which each of the
parties "marries" the other. Thus, in a pleading,
instead of averring that "the plaintiff was mar-
ried to the defendant," it would be proper to al-
lege that "the parties intermarried" at such a
time and place.

## INTERMEDDLE

pleader." Brown; Hall v. San Jacinto State Bank,

date of the federal government deemed to be un-
constitutional or to exceed the powers delegated
to the federal government. The doctrine denies
constitutional obligation of states to respect Su-
preme Court decisions with which they do not
agree. Bush v. Orleans Parish Sch. Bd., D.C.La.,
188 F.Supp. 916.
The concept is based on the 10th Amendment of
the Constitution of the United States reserving to
the states powers not delegated to the United
States. Historically, the doctrine emanated from
Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dallas 419, wherein the
state of Georgia, when sued in the Supreme Court
by a private citizen of another state, entered a
remonstrance and declined to recognize the court's
jurisdiction. Amendment 11 validated Georgia's
position.
Implementation of the doctrine may be peace-
able, as by resolution, remonstrance or legislation,
or may proceed ultimately to nullification, with
forcible resistance.
The Constitution does contemplate and provide
for the contingency of adverse state interposition
or legislation to annul or defeat the execution of
national laws. In re Charge to Grand Jury, Fed.
Cas.No.18,274 [2 Spr. 292].

## INTERPRET

To construe; to seek out the mean-
ing of language; to translate orally from one
tongue to another.
INTERPRETARE ET CONCORDARE LEGES
LEGIBUS, EST OPTIMUS INTERPRETANDI
MODUS. To interpret, and [in such a way as] to
harmonize laws with laws, is the best mode of
interpretation. 8 Coke, 169a.
INTERPRETATIO CHARTARUM BENIGNE FA-
CIENDA EST, UT RES MAGIS VALEAT QUAM
PEREAT. The interpretation of deeds is to be
liberal, that the thing may rather have effect than
fail. Broom, Max. 543.

## INTERPRETATIO FIENDA EST UT RES MAG- IS VALEAT QUAM PEREAT

Jenk. Cent. 198.
Such an interpretation is to be adopted that the
thing may rather stand than fall.
INTERPRETATIO TAMS IN AMBIGUIS SEM-
PER FIENDA EST UT EVITETUR INCONVEN-
IENS ET ABSURDUM. In cases of ambiguity,
such an interpretation should always be made that
what is inconvenient and absurd may be avoided.
4 Inst. 328.

## INTERPRETATION

The art or process of dis-
covering and expounding the meaning of a stat-
ute, will, contract, or other written document.
People v. Com'rs of Taxes, 95 N.Y. 559; Rome v.
Knox, 14 How. Prac., N.Y., 272; Ming v. Pratt,
22 Mont. 262, 56 P. 279; Tallman v. Tallman, 3
Misc. 465, 23 N.Y.S. 734; Roberts v. Portland Wa-
ter Dist., 124 Me. 63, 126 A. 162, 163; Cohn-Hall-
Marx Co. v. Vanosdall, 25 Ohio App. 360, 157 N.E.
908, 909.
The discovery and representation of the true
meaning of any signs used to convey ideas. Lieb.
Herm.
"Construction" is a term of wider scope than "interpre-
tation;" for, while the latter is concerned only with ascer-
taining the sense and meaning of the subject-matter, the
former may also be directed to explaining the legal effects
and consequences of the instrument in question. Hence
interpretation precedes construction, but stops at the writ-
ten text.
Interpretation and construction of written instruments
are not the same. A rule of construction is one which
either governs the effect of an ascertained intention, or
points out what the court should do in the absence of
express or implied intention, while a rule of interpretation
is one which governs the ascertainment of the meaning of
the maker of the instrument. In re Union Trust Co., 151
N.Y.S. 246, 249, 89 Misc. 69.
Close interpretation (interpretatio restricta) is
adopted if just reasons, connected with the for-
mation and character of the text, induce us to
take the words in their narrowest meaning. This
species of interpretation has generally been called
"literal," but the term is inadmissible. Lieb.
Herm. 54.
Extensive interpretation (interpretatio exten-
siva, called, also, "liberal interpretation") adopts
a more comprehensive signification of the word.
Lieb. Herm. 58.
Extravagant interpretation (interpretatio ex-
cedens) is that which substitutes a meaning evi-
dently beyond the true one. It is therefore not
genuine interpretation. Lieb. Herm. 59.
Free or unrestricted interpretation (interpreta-
tio soluta) proceeds simply on the general prin-
ciples of interpretation in good faith, not bound
by any specific or superior principle. Lieb. Herm.
Limited or restricted interpretation (interpre-
when we are influenced by other
principles than the strictly hermeneutic ones-
Lieb. Herm. 60.
Predestined interpretation (interpretatio pre-
destinata) takes place if the interpreter, laboring
under a strong bias of mind, makes the text sub-
servient to his preconceived views or desires.
This includes artful interpretation, (interpretatio
vafer,) by which the interpreter seeks to give a
meaning to the text other than the one he knows,
to have been intended. Lieb. Herm. 60.
It is said to be either "legal," which rests on the
same authority as the law itself, or "doctrinal,"
which rests upon its intrinsic reasonableness. Le-
g a 1 interpretation may be either "authentic," when
it is expressly provided by the legislator, or "us-
ual," when it is derived from unwritten practice.
Doctrinal interpretation may turn on the meaning
of words and sentences, when it is called "gram-
matical," or on the intention of the legislator,
when it is described as "logical." When logical in-
terpretation stretches the words of a statute to
cover its obvious meaning, it is called "extensive;"
when, on the other hand, it avoids giving full
meaning to the words, in order not to go beyond
the intention of the legislator, it is called "restric-
tive." Holl. Jur. 344.
As to strict and liberal interpretation, see Con-
struction.
In the civil law, authentic interpretation of laws';
isthat given by the legislator himself, which is
obligatory on the courts. Customary interpreta-
tion (also called "usual") is that which arises
from successive or concurrent decisions of the
court on the same subject-matter, having regard
to the spirit of the law, jurisprudence, usages,
and equity; as distinguished from "authentic" in-
terpretation, which is that given by the legislator
himself. Houston v. Robertson, 2 Tex. 26.

## INTERPRETATION CLAUSE

A section of a
statute which defines the meaning of certain
words occurring frequently in the other sections.

## INTERPRETER

A person sworn at a trial to
interpret the evidence of a foreigner or a deaf
and dumb person to the court. Amory v. Fellowes,
5 Mass. 226; People v. Lem Deo, 132 Cal. 199, 64
P. 266.

## INTERREGNUM

sovereign and the election of another. The va-
cancy which occurs when there is no government.

## INTERROGATOIRE

In French law. An act
which contains the interrogatories made by the
judge to the person accused, on the facts which
are the object of the accusation, and the answers
of the accused. Poth. Proc. Crim. c. 4, art. 2, § 1.

## INTERROGATORIES

A set or series of written
questions drawn up for the purpose of being pro-
pounded to a party in equity, a garnishee, or a
witness whose testimony is taken on deposition;
a series of formal written questions used in the
judicial examination of a party or a witness. In
taking evidence on depositions, the interrogatories
are usually prepared and settled by counsel, and
reduced to writing in advance of the examination.
Written questions propounded by one party and
served on adversary, who must serve written an-
swers thereto under oath. Neske v. Burns, 8 N.J.
Misc. 160, 149 A. 761.
Interrogatories are either direct or cross, the former
being those which are put on behalf of the party calling
a witness; the latter are those which are interposed by the
adverse party.

## INTERRUPTIO

Lat. Interruption. A term
used both in the civil and common law of pre-
scription. Calvin.

## INTERRUPTIO MULTIPLEX NON TOLLIT PRJESCRIPTIONEM SEMEL OBTENTAM

2
Inst. 654. Frequent interruption does not take
away a prescription once secured.

## INTERRUPTION

The occurrence of some act or
fact, during the period of prescription, which is
sufficient to arrest the running of the statute of
limitations. It is said to be either "natural" or
"civil," the former being caused by the act of the
party; the latter by the legal effect or operation
of some fact or circumstance. Innerarity v.
Mims, 1 Ala. 674; Carr v. Foster, 3 Q.B. 588;
Flight v. Thomas, 2 Adol. & El. 701.
Interruption of the possession is where the right is not
enjoyed or exercised continuously; interruption of the
right is where the person having or claiming the right
ceases the exercise of it in such a manner as to show that
he does not claim to be entitled to exercise it.
In Scotch law. The true proprietor's claiming
his right during the course of prescription. Bell.

## INTERSECTION

As applied to a street or high-
way means the space occupied by two streets at
the point where they cross each other. Rodgers
v. Commercial Casualty Ins. Co., 237 Ala. 301, 186
So. 684, 686. Space common to both streets or
highways, formed by continuing the curb lines.
Western Union Tel. Co. v. Dickson, 27 Tenn.App.
74, 173 S.W.2d 714, 718.
Point of intersection of two roads is the point where
their middle lines intersect. In re Springfield Road, 73 Pa.
127. But the term may also mean the point which each
of two approaching vehicles will reach at the same mo-
ment. Blashfleld, Cyc. of Automobile Law and Prac.,
Perm.Ed., § 983.
"Intersection" may apply where street or highway runs
into but without crossing another. Thrush v. Lingo Lum-
ber Co., Tex.Civ.App., 262 S.W. 551, 553; Pangborn v.

## INTERSTATE COMMERCE ACT

The act of
congress of February 4, 1887 (49 U.S.C.A. § 1 et
seq.), designed to regulate commerce between the
states, and particularly the transportation of per-
sons and property, by carriers, between interstate
points, prescribing that charges for such trans-
portation shall be reasonable Ind just, prohibiting
unjust discrimination, rebates, draw-backs, prefer-
ences, pooling of freights, etc., requiring sched-
ules of rates to be published, establishing a com-
mission to carry out the measures enacted, and
prescribing the powers and duties of such com-
mission and the procedure before it.

## INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION

commission created by the interstate commerce
act (q. v.) to carry out the measures therein en-
acted, composed of eleven persons, appointed by the
President, empowered to inquire into the business

ceive, investigate, and determine complaints made
to them of any violation of the act, make annual
reports, hold stated sessions, etc. 49 U.S.C.A. § 11.

for the determination of controversies between
citizens of different states in respect to mutual

diversity in the laws or institutions of the several
states.

## INTERVENING ACT

Of third person in order to
break chain of causation and obviate liability for
original breach of duty must be a superseding
cause and one which original wrongdoer was not
bound to anticipate as the natural or ordinary re-
sult of his acts. Frazier v. Ayres, La.App., 20 So.
2d 754, 759; Littell v. Argus Production Co., C.C.A.
Kan., 78 F.2d 955, 957.

## INTERVENING AGENCY

To render an original
wrong a remote cause, an "intervening agency,"
must be independent of such wrong, adequate to
produce the injury, so interrupting the natural
sequence of events as to produce a result different
from what would have been produced, and one
that could not have been reasonably expected from
the original wrong. Lemos v. Madden, 28 Wyo.
1, 200 P. 791, 795.
An independent "intervening agency" which will protect
the original wrongdoer must be the efficient cause of the
injury of which complaint is made, and not a negligent act
or omission of such agency concurring with or succeeding
the original negligence permitted by the original wrong-
doer to continue and which in the natural course of events
results in such injury. In short, the result prevented by
the intervening agency must be the injury complained of,
and not the requital for that injury. Swanson v. Slagal,
212 Ind. 394, 8 N.E.2d 993, 1000.
An "intervening efficient cause" is a new and independ-
ent force which breaks the causal connection between the
original wrong and injury, and itself becomes direct and
immediate cause of injury. Phillabaum v. Lake Erie & W.
R. Co., 315 Ill. 131, 145 N.E. 806, 808.

## INTERVENING CAUSE

The "intervening cause,"
which will relieve of liability for an injury, is an
independent cause which intervenes between the
original wrongful act or omission and the injury,
turns aside the natural sequence of events, and
produces a result which would not otherwise have
followed and which could not have been reason-
ably anticipated. Hartman v. Atchison, T. & S. F.
Ry. Co., 94 Kan. 184, 146 P. 335, 336, L.R.A. 1915D,
563. An act of an independent agency which de-
stroys the causal connection between the negli-
gent act of the defendant and the wrongful injury;
the independent act being the immediate cause,
in which case damages are not recoverable be-
cause the original wrongful act is not the proxi-
mate cause. Davenport v. McClellan, 88 N.J.L.
653, 96 A. 921.

## INTERVENING DAMAGES

See Damages.

## INTERVENING FORCE

One which actively op-
erates in producing harm to another after the
actor's negligent act or omission has been commit-
ted. Walborn v. Epley, 148 Pa.Super. 417, 24 A.2d
668, 671; American Mut. Liability Ins. Co. v.
Buckley & Co., C.C.A.Pa., 117 F.2d 845, 847.

## INTERVENOR

An intervenor is a person who
voluntarily interposes in an action or other pro-
ceeding with the leave of the court. Ladue v.
Goodhead, 181 Misc. 807, 44 N.Y.S.2d 783, 787.

## INTERVENTION

In international law. Inter-
vention is such an interference between two or
more states as may (according to the event) re-
sult in a resort to force; while mediation always
is, and is intended to be and to continue, peaceful
only. Intervention between a sovereign and his
own subjects is not justified by anything in inter-
national law; but a remonstrance may be ad-
dressed to the sovereign in a proper case. Brown.
In English ecclesiastical law. The proceeding
of a third person, who, not being originally a party
to the suit or proceeding, but claiming an interest
in the subject-matter in dispute, in order the better
to protect such interest, interposes his claim. 2
Chit. Pr. 492; 3 Chit. Commer. Law, 633; 2 Hagg.
Const. 137; 3 Phillim. Ecc. Law, 586; Stillwell
Hotel Co. v. Anderson, 16 Cal.App.2d 636, 61 P.2d
In the civil law. The act by which a third party
demands to be received as a party in a suit pend-
ing between other persons. Stillwell Hotel Co. v.
Anderson, 16 Cal.App.2d 636, 61 P.2d 71, 73.
The intervention is made either for the purpose
of being joined to the plaintiff, and to claim the
same thing he does, or some other thing connected
with it; or to join the defendant, and with him
to oppose the claim of the plaintiff, which it is
his interest to defeat. Poth. Proc. Civile, pt. 1, c.
2, § 7, no. 3.
In practice. A proceeding in a suit or action by
which a third person is permitted by the court to
make himself a party, either joining the plaintiff
in claiming what is sought by the complaint, or
uniting with the defendant in resisting the claims
of the plaintiff, or demanding something adversely
to both of them. Logan v. Greenlaw, C.C.Tenn.,
12 F. 16; Fischer v. Hanna, 8 Colo.App. 471, 47
P. 303; Gale v. Frazier, 4 Dak. 196, 30 N.W. 138;
Reay v. Butler, Cal., 7 P. 671; Gorham v. Hall, 172
Ark. 744, 290 S.W. 357, 358; Adler v. Seaman, C.C.
A.Mo., 266 F. 828, 832; In re Prouty's Estate, 107
Vt. 496, 181 A. 134.

## INTESTABILIS

Lat. A witness incompetent to
testify. Calvin.

## INTESTABLE

One who has not testamentary
capacity; e. g., an infant, lunatic, or person civilly
dead.

## INTESTACY

The state or condition of dying
without having made a valid will, or without hav-
ing disposed by will of a part of his property. In
re Shestack's Estate, 267 Pa. 115, 110 A. 166;
Brown v. Mugway, 15 N.J.L. 331.
Besides the strict meaning of the word as above given,
there is also a sense in which intestacy may be partial;
that is, where a man leaves a will which does not dispose
of his whole estate, he is said to "die intestate" as to the
property so omitted.

## INTESTATE

Without making a will. A person
is said to die intestate when he dies without mak-
ing a will, or dies without leaving anything to test-
ify what his wishes were with respect to the dis-
posal of his property after his death. The word
is also often used to signify the person himself.
Thus, in speaking of the property of a person who
died intestate, it is common to say "the intestate's
property;" e., the property of the person dying
in an intestate condition. Brown. In re Camer-
on's Estate, 47 App.Div. 120, 62 N.Y.S. 187; Mess-
mann v. Egenberger, 46 App.Div. 46, 61 N.Y.S.
556; Code Civ.Proc.N.Y. 1899, § 2514, subd. 1 (Sur-
rogate's Court Act, § 314, subd. 1).

## INTESTATE LAWS

Statutes which provide and
prescribe the devolution of estates of persons who
die without disposing of their estates by law, will
or testament. Fullbright v. Boardman, 159 Ga.
162, 125 S.E. 44, 46, 37 A.L.R. 532; In re Rogers'
Estate, Mo.Sup., 250 S.W. 576, 578; Ford v. U. S.,
C.C.A.N.Y., 205 F. 130, 134.

## INTESTATE SUCCESSION

A succession is
called "intestate" when the deceased has left no
will, or when his will has been revoked or annulled
cession has fallen by the effects of law only are
called "heirs ab intestato." Civ. Code La. art.

## INTESTATO

Lat. In the civil law. Intestate;
without a will. Calvin.

## INTESTATUS

Lat. In the civil and old English
law. An intestate; one who dies without a will.
Dig. 50, 17, 7.
INTESTATUS DECEDIT, QUI AUT OMNIO
TESTAMENTUM NON FECIT; AUT NON JURE
FECIT; AUT ID QUOD FECERAT RUPTUM IR-
RITUMVE FACTUM EST; AUT NEMO EX EO
HARES EXSTITIT. A person dies intestate who
either has made no testament at all or has made
one not legally valid; or if the testament he has
made be revoked, or made useless; or if no one
becomes heir under it. Inst. 3, 1, pr.

## INTIMACY

As generally applied to persons, it
is understood to mean a proper, friendly relation
of the parties, but it is frequently used to convey
the idea of an improper relation; an intimacy at
least disreputable and degrading. Collins v. Pub.
Co., 152 Pa. 187, 25 A. 546, 34 Am.St.Rep. 636.
See McCarty v. Coffin, 157 Mass. 478, 32 N.E. 649.

## INTIMATE

Close in friendship or acquaintance,
familiar, confidential; also near, close, direct,
thorough, complete. Atkins Corporation v. Tour-
ny, 6 Ca1.2d 206, 57 P.2d 480, 484.

## INTIMATION

In the civil law. A notification to
a party that some step in a legal proceeding is
asked or will be taken. Particularly, a notice giv-
en by the party taking an appeal, to the other
party, that the court above will hear the appeal.
In Scotch law. A formal written notice, drawn
by a notary, to be served on a party against whom
a stranger has acquired a right or claim; e. g.,
the assignee of a debt must serve such a notice
on the debtor, otherwise a payment to the original
creditor will be good.

## INTIMIDATION

Unlawful coercion; duress;
putting in fear. Michaels v. Hillman, 112 Misc.
395, 183 N.Y.S. 195, 200; Kayser v. Fitzgerald, 109
Misc. 27, 178 N.Y.S. 130, 134; Burns v. Lackey, 171
Ky. 21, 186 S.W. 909, 913; Southwick v. State, 126
Ark. 188, 189 S.W. 843, 844; Shehany v. Lowry,
170 Ga. 70, 152 S.E. 114, 115.

## INTIMIDATION OF VOTERS

This, by statute
in several of the states, is made a criminal of-
fense. Under an early Pennsylvania act, it was
held that, to constitute the offense of intimidation
of voters, there must be a preconceived intention
for the purpose of intimidating the officers or in-
terrupting the election. Respublica v. Gibbs, 3
Yeates, Pa., 429.

## INTITLE

An old form of "entitle." 6 Mod. 304.

## INTO

A preposition signifying to the inside of;
within. It expresses entrance, or a passage from
verbs expressing motion. It has been held equiva-
lent to, or synonymous with, "at," "inside of," and
"to," and has been distinguished from the words
"from" and "through." 48 C.J.S. p. 120.
INTOL and UTTOL. In old records. Toll or cus-
tom paid for things imported and exported, or
bought in and sold out. Cowell.

## INTOLERABLE CRUELTY

In the law of di-
vorce, this term denotes extreme cruelty, cruel
and inhuman treatment, barbarous, savage, and
inhuman conduct, and is equivalent to any of those
phrases. Shaw v. Shaw, 17 Conn. 193; Morehouse
v. Morehouse, 70 Conn. 420, 39 A. 516; Blain v.
Blain, 45 Vt. 544.

## INTOXICATED

der the influence of an intoxicating liquor. Tay-
lor v. Joyce, 4 Cal.App.2d 612, 41 P.2d 967, 968.

## INTOXICATING LIQUOR

Any liquor used as a
beverage, and which, when so used in sufficient
quantities, ordinarily or commonly produces entire
or partial intoxication; any liquor intended for
use as a beverage or capable of being so used,
which contains alcohol, either obtained by fermen-
tation or by the additional process of distillation,
in such proportion that it will produqe intoxication
when imbibed in such quantities as may practical-
ly be drunk. Intoxicating Liquor Cases, 25 Kan.
767, 37 Am.Rep. 284; Com'rs v. Taylor, 21 N.Y.
173; People v. Hawley, 3 Mich. 339; State v. Ol-
iver, 26 W.Va. 431, 53 Am.Rep. 79; Frisvold v.
Leahy, 15 Ca1.App.2d 752, 60 P.2d 151, 153; Wor-
ley v. Spurgeon, 38 Iowa 465. See, also, Alcoholic
Liquors.

## INTOXICATION

The state of being poisoned;
the condition produced by the administration or
introduction into the human system of a poison.
But in its popular use this term is restricted to
alcoholic intoxication, that is, drunkenness or in-
ebriety, or the mental and physical condition in-
duced by drinking excessive quantities of alcoholic
liquors, and this is its meaning as used in, statutes,
indictments, etc. Sapp v. State, 116 Ga. 182, 42
S.E. 410; State v. Pierce, 65 Iowa 85, 21 N.W. 195;
Wadsworth v. Dunnam, 98 Ala. 610, 13 So. 599;

breath testing device that operates on assumption
that concentration of blood alcohol bears fixed re-

## INUNDATION

The overflow of waters by com-
ing out of their bed. See, also, Dam; Backwater;
Irrigation; Waters; Water Course.
Inundations may arise from three causes : from public
necessity, as in defence of a place it may be necessary to
dam the current of a stream, which will cause an inunda-
tion to the upper lands; they may be occasioned by an
invincible force, as by the accidental fall of a rock in the
stream, or by a natural flood or freshet; or they may
result from the erection of works on the stream. In the
first case, the injury caused by the inundation is to be com-
pensated as other injuries done in war; in the second, as
there was no fault of any one, the loss is to be borne by the
unfortunate owner of the estate; in the last, when the
riparian proprietor is injured by such works as alter the
level of the water where it enters or where it leaves the
property on which they are erected, the person injured
may recover ,damages for the injury thus caused to his
property by the inundation, 9 Co. 59; 1 B. & Ald. 258;
Sumner v. Tileston, 7 Pick., Mass., 198; Bailey v. City of

the modes of acquiring title to property by occu-
pancy. Heinecc. lib. 2, tit. 1, § 350.

tiones," is also used.

## INVENTION

In patent law. The act or opera-
tion of finding out something new; the process
of contriving and producing something not pre-
viously known or existing, by the exercise of inde-
pendent investigation and experiment. Also the
article or contrivance or composition so invented.
Leidersdorf v. Flint, 15 Fed.Cas. 260; Smith v.
Nichols, 21 Wall. 118, 22 L.Ed. 566; Hollister v.
Manufacturing Co., 5 S.Ct. 717, 113 U.S. 72, 28 L.
Ed. 901; Murphy Mfg. Co. v. Excelsior Car Roof
Co., C.C.Mo., 70 F. 495.
A concept or thing evolved from the mind. "Invention"
is not a revelation of something which existed and was
unknown, but the creation of something which did not exist
before, and possessing elements of novelty and utility in
kind and measure different from, and greater than, what
the art might expect from skilled workers. Pyrene Mfg.
Co. v. Boyce, C.C.A.N.J., 292 F. 480, 481. The finding out—
the contriving, the creating of something which did not
exist, and was not known before, and which can be made
useful and advantageous in the pursuits of life, or which
can add to the enjoyment of mankind. Conover v. Roach,
4 Fish. 12. Fed.Cas.No.3,125. Not every improvement is
invention; but to entitle a thing to protection it must be
the product of some exercise of the inventive faculties. and
it must involve something more than what is obvious to
persons skilled in the art to which it relates. Rosenwasser
v. Berry, C.C.Me., 22 F. 841. Mere adaptation of known
process to clearly analogous use is not invention. Firestone
Tire and Rubber Co. v. U. S. Rubber Co., C.C.A.Ohio, 79
F.2d 948. 952. 953.
"Invention" involves the exercise of the creative mind.
Aeolian Co. v. Wanamaker, D.C., 221 F. 666, 668.
Inventive skill has been defined as that intuitive faculty
of the mind put forth in the search for new results, or new
methods, creating what had not before existed, or bringing
to light what lay hidden from vision; it differs from a
suggestion of that common experience which arose spon-
taneously and by a necessity of human reasoning in the
minds of those who had become acquainted with the cir-
cumstances with which they had to deal. Hollister v. Mfg.
Co., 113 U.S. 72, 5 S.Ct. 717, 28 L.Ed. 901. -Invention, in
the nature of improvements, is the double mental act of
discerning, in existing machines, processes or articles,
some deficiency, and pointing out the means of overcoming
it. General Electric Co. v. Electric Co., Ill., 174 F. 246, 98
C. C. A. 154.
An "invention" differs from a "discovery." The former
term is properly applicable to the contrivance and produc-
tion of something that did not before exist; while dis-
covery denotes the bringing into knowledge and use of
something which, although it existed, was before unknown.
Thus, we speak of the "discovery" of the properties of
light, electricity, etc., while the telescope and the electric
motor are the results of the process of "invention."
For "Examination of invention", see Examina-
tion.

## INVENTIONES

## INVENTOR

One who finds out or contrives some

kins, C.C.Mass., 60 F. 764.

with their estimated or actual values. In law, the
term is particularly applied to such a list made
by an executor, administrator, or assignee in bank-
ruptcy. See Silver Bow Min. Co. v. Lowry, 5 Mont.
618, 6 P. 62; Lloyd v. Wyckoff, 11 N.J.Law, 224;
Roberts, etc., Co. v. Sun Mut. L. Ins. Co., 48 S.W.

## INVESTITURE

A ceremony which accompanied
the grant of lands in the feudal ages, and con-
sisted in the open and notorious delivery of pos-
session in the presence of the other vassals, which
perpetuated among them the sera of their new ac-
quisition at the time when the art of writing was
very little known; and thus the evidence of the
property was reposed in the memory of the neigh-
borhood, who, in case of disputed title, were after-
wards called upon to decide upon it. Brown.
In Ecclesiastical law. Investiture is one of the
formalities by which the election of a bishop is
confirmed by the archbishop. See Phillim. Ecc.
Law, 42, et seq.

## INVIOLABILITY

## INVITATION

In the law of negligence, and with
reference to trespasses on realty, invitation is the
act of one who solicits or incites others to enter
upon, remain in, or make use of, his property or
structures thereon, or who so arranges the prop-
erty or the means of access to it or of transit over
it as to induce the reasonable belief that he ex-
pects and intends that others shall come upon it
or pass over it. Sweeney v. Old Colony & N. R.
Co., 10 Allen, Mass., 373, 87 Am.Dec. 644; Wilson
v. New York, N. H. & H. R. Co., 18 R.I. 491, 29 A.
258; Wright v. Boston & A. R. Co., 142 Mass. 300,
7 N.E. 866.
Thus the proprietor of a store, theatre or amusement
park "invites" the public to come upon his premises for
such purposes as are comiected with its intended use.
Again, the fact that safety gates at a railroad crossing,
which should be closed in case of danger, are left standing
open, is an "invitation" to the traveler on the highway to
cross. Roberts v. Delaware & H. Canal Co., 177 Pa. 183,
35 A. 723. So, bringing a passenger train on a railroad to
a full stop at a regular station is an "invitation to alight."
License distinguished
A license Is a passive permission on the part of the
owner of premises, with reference to other persons enter-
ing upon or using them, while an invitation implies a
request, solicitation or desire that they should do so. An
invitation may be inferred where there is a common inter-
est or mutual advantage; while a license will be inferred
where the object is the mere pleasure or benefit of the per-
son using it. Bennett v. Louisville & N. R. Co., 102 U.S.
580, 26 L.Ed. 235; Weldon v. Philadelphia, W. & B. R. Co.,
2 Pennewill, Del., 1, 43 A. 159; Babcock and Wilcox Co. v.
Nolton, 58 Nev. 131, 71 P.2d 1051, 1053. An owner owes to
a licensee no duty as to the condition of the premises
(unless imposed by statute) save that he should not know-
ingly let him run upon a hidden peril or willfully cause
him harm; while to one invited he is under the obligation
to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe and secure
condition. Beehler v. Daniels, 18 R.I. 563, 29 A. 6, 27
L.R.A. 512, 49 Am.St.Rep. 790.
Express and implied
An invitation may be express, when the owner or occu-
pier of the land by words invites another to come upon it
or make use of it or of something thereon; or it may be
implied when such owner or occupier by acts or conduct
leads another to believe that the land or something thereon
was intended to be used as he uses them, and that such use
is not only acquiesced in by the owner or occupier, but is
in accordance with the intention or design for which the
way or place or thing was adapted and prepared and
allowed to be used. Turess v. New York, S. & W. R. Co.,
61 N.J.L. 314, 40 A. 614; Furey v. New York Cent. R. Co.,

Corkle v. Maxwell, 6 Fed.Cas. 555.

## INVOLUNTARY SERVITUDE

The condition of
one who is compelled by force, coercion, or im-
prisonment, and against his will, to labor for an-
other, whether he is paid or not. See State v.

most fit, wealthy and discreet of the judges.

## IRA FUROR BREVIS EST

Anger is a short in-
sanity. Beardsley v. Maynard, 4 Wend., N.Y., 336,
IRA MOTUS. Lat. Moved or excited by anger

## IRON-SAFE CLAUSE

A common clause in poli-
cies of fire insurance, requiring the insured to
preserve his books and inventory in an iron or
fireproof safe, or in some secure place not ex-
posed to a fire which would destroy the building.
This provision casts on the insured the responsi-
bility for the loss of books and records if due to
the wrongful act or negligence of himself or his
employees in failing to comply with the require-
ment. 45 C.J.S. p. 358.

## IRRATIONAL

Unreasonable, foolish, absurd; a
person may be irrational in such sense, and still
not be insane in the legal sense. Lee v. State, 30
Okl.Cr. 14, 234 P. 654, 655.

## IRRECUSABLE

A term used to indicate a cer-
tain class of contractual obligations recognized by
the law which are imposed upon a person without
his consent and without regard to any act of his
own. They are distinguished from recusable ob-
ligations which are the result of a voluntary act
on the part of a person on whom they are imposed
by law. A clear example of an irrecusable obli-
gation is the obligation imposed on every man not
to strike another without some lawful excuse.
A recusable obligation is based upon some act of
a person bound, which is a condition precedent
to the genesis of the obligation. These terms were
first suggested by Prof. Wigmore in 8 Harv. Law
Rev. 200. See Harr. Contr. 6.

## IRREGULAR

Not according to rule; improper
or insufficient, by reason of departure from the
prescriber) course.
As to irregular "Deposit," "Indorsement," "Pro-
cess," and "Succession," see those titles.

## IRREGULAR JUDGMENT

One rendered con-
trary to the course and practice of the court.
Duplin County v. Ezzell, 223 N.C. 531, 27 S.E.2d
448, 450.
in the conduct of a suit at law, which, conforma-
bly with the practice of the court, ought or ought
not to be done. Doe ex dem. Cooper v. Harter, 2
Ind. 252. Violation or nonobservance of estab-
lished rules and practices. The want of adher-
ence to some prescribed rule or mode of proceed-
ing; consisting either in omitting to do something
that is necessary for the due and orderly conduct-
ing of a suit, or doing it in an unseasonable time
or improper manner. Coulter v. Board of Com'rs
of Bernalillo County, 22 N.M. 24, 158 P. 1086; Ex
parte Davis, 118 Or. 693, 247 P. 809, 811; Emeric
v. Alvarado, 64 Cal. 529, 2 P. 418; Hall v. Mung-
er, 5 Lans., N.Y., 113; Corn Exch. Bank v. Blye,
119 N.Y. 414, 23 N.E. 805; Salter v. Hilgen, 40 Wis.
365; Turrill v. Walker, 4 Mich. 183. The technical
term for every defect in practical proceedings, or
the mode of conducting an action or defense, as
distinguishable from defects in pleadings. 3 Chit.
Gen. Pr. 509.
Not synonymous with illegality. City of Tampa v. Pal-
mer, 89 Fla. 514, 105 So. 115, 117. "Irregularity" is a want
of adherence to some prescribed rule or mode of proceed-
ing, while "illegality" denotes a radical defect. United
States v. Salomon, D.C.La., 231 F. 461, 463; U. S. v. Rich-
mond, C.C.A.Pa., 17 F.2d 28, 32. "Illegality" in the assess-
ment of a tax is a substantial defect contrary to law and
leaving the proceeding with nothing to stand on, while an
"irregularity" is a formal defect contrary only to the prac-
tice authorized by law, and relating rather to the manner
of doing the act than to the act itself. Bunten v. Rock
Springs Grazing Ass'n, 29 Wyo. 461, 215 P. 244, 254.
Under statutes authorizing the modification or setting
aside of judgments, "irregularity" is some departure from
the prescribed procedure in the trial, or in the determina-
tion of the action, not evidenced by a ruling or an order.
Duncan v. Wilkins, 103 Okl. 221, 229 P. 801, 802; American
Nat. Bank of Tucumcari v. Tarpley, 31 N.M. 667, 250 P.
18, 20. But under a statute providing for relief against an
irregularity in obtaining a judgment, the term has no fixed
legal meaning, and in every instance the question is one
of fact, dependent upon the circumstances of each case.
Nation v. Savely, 127 Okl. 117, 260 P. 32, 34.
Irregularity in the proceedings of the court, as
used in a California statute pertaining to new
trials, relates to matters occurring during the
trial, and not after it. Diamond v. Superior Court
of California in and for City and County of San
Francisco, 189 Cal. 732, 210 P. 36, 37.
In Canon law. Any impediment which pre-
vents a man from taking holy orders.
General
Legal Irregularity. An irregularity occurring
in the course of some legal proceeding. A defect
or informality which, in the technical view of the
law, is to be accounted an irregularity.

## IRRELEVANCY

The absence of the quality of
relevancy, as in evidence or pleadings. The quali-
ty or state of being inapplicable or impertinent
to a fact or argument.
Irrelevancy, in an answer, consists in statements which
are not material to the decision of the case; such as do
not form or tender any material issue. People v. McCum-
ber, 18 N.Y. 321, 72 Am.Dec. 515; Walker v. Hewitt, 11
How.Prac., N.Y., 398; Carpenter v. Bell, 1 Rob., N.Y.,
715; Smith v. Smith, 50 S.C. 54, 27 S.E. 545. See, also,
Irrelevant.
applicable to the matter in issue; not supporting
the issue. Crump v. Lanham, 67 Okl. 33, 168 P. 43,
44. Evidence is irrelevant where it has no tend-
ency to prove or disprove any issue involved.
Malone v. State, 16 Ala.App. 185, 76 So. 469, 470.

## IRRELEVANT ALLEGATION

One which has no
substantial relation to the controversy between
the parties to the suit, and which cannot affect the
decision of the court. Wayte v. Bowker Chemical
Co., 196 App.Div. 665, 187 N.Y.S. 276, 277; Com-
mander Milling Co. v. Westinghouse Electric and
Mfg. Co., C.C.A.Minn., 70 F.2d 469, 472; The test
of any allegation being whether it tends to consti-
tute a cause of action or a defense, Isaacs v.
Solomon, 159 App.Div. 675, 144 N.Y.S. 876, 877.
An allegation is irrelevant, where the issue made by its
denial has no effect upon the cause of action or no connec-
tion with the allegation. Germofert Mfg. Co. v. Castles,
97 S.C. 389, 81 S.E. 665, 666. In this connection, "redun-
dant" is almost a synonym for "irrelevant." Plank v.
Hopkins, 35 S.D. 243, 151 N.W. 1017, 1019.

## IRRELEVANT ANSWER

See Answer.

## IRREMOVABILITY

The status of a pauper in
England, who cannot be legally removed from
the parish or union in which he is receiving relief,
notwithstanding that he has not acquired a settle-
ment there. 3 Steph.Comm. 60. Thus a pauper
who has resided in a parish during the whole of
the preceding year is irremovable, in view of
Stat. 28 and 29 Vict. c. 79, § 8.

## IRREPARABLE DAMAGES

See Damages.

## IRREPARABLE INJURY

delivered on sureties. Spelled, also, "irreplevisa-
ble." Co. Litt. 145; 13 Edw. I. c. 2.

## IRRESISTIBLE FORCE

A term applied to such
an interposition of human agency as is, from its
nature and power, absolutely uncontrollable; as
the inroads of a hostile army. Story, Bailm. § 25;
Noel Bros. v. Texas & P. Ry. Co., 16 La.App. 622,
133 So. 830, 832.

## IRRESISTIBLE IMPULSE

Used chiefly in crim-
inal law, this term means an impulse to commit
an unlawful or criminal act which cannot be re-
sisted or overcome by the patient because insanity
or mental disease has destroyed the freedom of
his will and his power of self-control and of choice
as to his actions. McCarty v. Corn., 114 Ky. 620,
71 S.W. 658; State v. Knight, 95 Me. 467, 50 A.
276, 55 L.R.A. 373; Leache v. State, 22 Tex.App.
279, 3 S.W. 539, 58 Am.Rep. 638; State v. Peel, 23
Mont. 358, 59 P. 169, 75 Am.St.Rep. 529. And see
Insanity.

## IRREVOCABLE

recalled. Commissioner of Internal Revenue v.
Strong Mfg. Co., C.C.A.6, 124 F.2d 360, 363.

## IRREVOCABLE LETTER

A confirmed irrevoca-
ble letter of credit, irrevocable letter, or a con-
firmed credit is a contract to pay on compliance
with its terms, and needs no formal acknowledg-
Lamborn v. National Park Bank of New York, 240
N.Y. 520, 148 N.E. 664, 665.

## IRRIGATION

The operation of watering lands
for agricultural purposes by artificial means. In
its primary sense, a sprinkling or watering; spe-
cifically, the application of water to lands for the
raising of agricultural crops and other products
of the soil. Platte Water Co. v. Irrigation Co., 12
Colo. 529, 21 P. 711; City and County of Denver v.
Brown, 56 Colo. 216, 138 P. 44, 49.

## IRRIGATION COMPANY

A private corporation,
authorized and regulated by statute in several
states, having for its object to acquire exclusive
rights to the water of certain streams or other
sources of supply, and to convey it by means of
ditches or canals through a region where it can
be beneficially used for agricultural purposes, and
either dividing the water among stockholders, or
making contracts with consumers, or furnishing
a supply to all who apply at fixed rates.

## IRRIGATION DISTRICT

A public and quasi-
municipal corporation authorized by law in several
states, comprising a defined region or area of land
which is susceptible of one mode of irrigation from
a common source and by the same system of
works. These districts are created by proceedings
in the nature of an election under the supervision
of a court, and are authorized to purchase or con-
demn the lands and waters necessary for the sys-
tem of irrigation proposed and to construct nec-
cessary canals and other works, and the water is
apportioned ratably among the landowners of the
district. Nampa & Meridian Irr. Dist. v. Briggs,
27 Idaho 84, 147 P. 75, 82.

## IRROGARE

Lat. In the civil law. To impose
or set upon, as a fine. Calvin. To inflict, as a

## IRROTULATIO

L. Lat. An enrolling; a record.
IS. This word, although normally referring to
the present, Cunningham v. Moser, 910k1. 44, 215
P. 758, 759; Jenkins v. First Nat. Bank, 73 Mont.
110, 236 P. 1085, 1087; often has a future meaning,
but is not synonymous with "shall have been."
State v. Jorgenson, 25 N.D. 539, 142 N.W. 450, 462,
49 L.R.A.,N.S., 67. It may have, however, a past
signification, as in the sense of "has been." 48
C.J.S. p. 774.

## IS QUI COGNOSCIT

Lat. The cognizor in a
fine. Is cui cognoscitur, the cognizee.
ISM In Scotch law. The period of the termina-

## ISLAND

A piece of land surrounded by water.
Webber v. Pere Marquette Boom Co., 62 Mich.
626, 30 N.W. 469; Goff v. Cougle, 118 Mich. 307,
76 N.W. 489, 42 L.R.A. 161.
An island that arises in the bed of a stream usually first
presents itself as a sand bar, Cox v. Arnold, 129 Mo. 337,
31 S. W. 592, 50 Am.St.Rep. 450; Glassell v. Hansen, 135
Cal. 547, 67 P. 964; Holman v. Hodges, 112 Iowa, 714, 84
N.W. 950, 58 L.R.A. 673, 84 Am.St.Rep. 367; a bar, before
it will support vegetation of any kind, may become valu-
able for fishing, hunting, as a shooting park, for the har-
vest of ice, for pumping sand, etc. If further deposits of
alluvion upon it would make it more valuable, the law of
accretion should still apply, Fowler v. Wood, 73 Kan. 511,
85 P. 763, 6 L.R.A.,N.S., 162, 117 Am.St.Rep. 534. Land in
a navigable stream which is surrounded by water only in
times of high water is not an island within the rule that
the state takes title to newly formed islands in navigable
streams. Payne v. Hall, 192 Iowa, 780, 185 N.W. 912, 915.

## ISOLATED TRANSACTION

This term, in con-
nection with the rule that single or isolated trans-
actions do not violate a statute prohibiting foreign
corporations from doing business within a state
without first filing a copy of their charter, may
be inapplicable to a single transaction consummat-
ed in furtherance of a corporation's business,
where it is shown that the corporation in question
is a foreign corporation, with its principal office
in a town in a sister state near the state line,
and that it has solicited business generally in trib-
utary territory within the adjoining state. Dahl
Implement & Lumber Co. v. Campbell, 45 N.D.
239, 178 N.W. 197, 198.
ISSEI, Jap. A term used to describe alien Jap-
anese residing in the United States. 1945 Report
of the Tenney Joint Fact-Finding Committee on
Un-American Activities to the California Legisla-
ture p. 48.

## ISSINT

A law French term, meaning "thus,"
"so," giving its name to part of a plea in debt.
A term formerly used to introduce a statement
that special matter already pleaded amounts to a
denial.
An example of this form of plea, which is sometimes
called the special general issue, occurs in Bauer v. Roth, 4
Rawle, Pa., 83.

## ISSUABLE

In practice. Leading or tending to,
or producing, an issue; relating to an issue or
issues. See Colquitt v. Mercer, 44 Ga. 433.

## ISSUABLE DEFENSE

A technical expression
meaning a plea to the merits, properly setting
forth a legal defense, as distinguished from a
plea in abatement, or any plea going only to delay
the case. Adamson v. Reagin, 143 Ga. 306, 84 S.
E. 965.

## ISSUABLE PLEA

A plea to the merits; a tra-
versable plea. A plea such that the adverse par-
ty can join issue upon it and go to trial. It is
true a plea in abatement is a plea, and, if it be
properly pleaded, issues may be found on it. In
the ordinary meaning of the word "plea," and of
the word "issuable," such pleas may be called
"issuable pleas," but, when these two words are
used together, "issuable plea," or "issuable de-
fense," they have a technical meaning, to-wit,
pleas to the merits. Colquitt v. Mercer, 44 Ga. 434.

## ISSUABLE TERMS

In the former practice of
the English courts, Hilary term and Trinity term
were called "issuable terms," because the issues
to be tried at the assizes were made up at those
terms. 3 Bl.Comm. 353. But the distinction is
superseded by the provisions of the judicature acts
of 1873 and 1875.

## ISSUE

To send forth; to emit; to promulgate;
as, an officer issues orders, process issues from a
court. To put into circulation; as, the treasury
issues notes. To send out, to send out officially;
to deliver, for use, or authoritatively; to go forth
as authoritative or binding. Stokes v. Paschall,
Tex.Civ.App., 243 S.W. 611, 614; Blythe v. Doheny,
C.C.A.Cal., 73 F.2d 799, 803.
A writ is "issued" when it is delivered to an officer, with
the intent to have it served, Wilkins v. Worthen, 62 Ark.
401, 36 S.W. 21; Michigan Ins. Bk. v. Eldred, 130 U.S. 693,
9 S.Ct. 690, 32 L.Ed. 1080; Webster v. Sharpe, 116 N.C.
466, 21 S.E. 912; Ferguson v. Estes & Alexander, Tex.Civ.
App., 214 S.W. 465, 466.
When used with reference to a writ of error, State v.
Brown, 103 N.J.L. 519, 138 A. 370 ; a writ of scire facias,
In re Johns' Estate, 253 Pa. 532, 98 A. 719, 720; a writ of
attachment, McMaster v. Ruby, 80 Or. 476, 157 P. 782, 784;
corporate stock, Cattlemen's Trust Co. of Fort Worth v.
Turner, Tex.Civ.App., 182 S.W. 438, 441; a bond, Klutts v.
Jones, 20 N.M. 230, 148 P. 494, 499; Travis v. First Nat.
Bank, 210 Ala. 620, 98 So. 890, 891; Steinbruck v. Milford
Tp., 100 Kan. 93, 163 P. 647; State v. School Board of
Tecumseh Rural High School Dist. No. 4, 110 Kan. 779, 204
P. 742, 744; a deed, Wyman v. Hageman, 318 Ill. 64, 148
N.E. 852, 855; a note, Foster v. Security Bank & Trust
Co., Tex.Com.App., 288 S.W. 438, 440; an insurance policy,
Coleman v. New England Mut. Life Ins. Co., 236 Mass. 552,
129 N.E. 288, 289; National Liberty Ins. Co. v. Norman,
C.C.A.N.C., 11 F.2d 59, 61; and the like, the term is ordi-
narily construed as importing delivery to the proper per-
son, or to the proper officer for service, etc. But it does
not invariably have such a meaning. Estabrook & Co. v.
Consolidated Gas, Electric Light & Power Co. of Baltimore,
122 Md. 643, 90 A. 523, 524.
In financial parlance the term "Issue" seems to have two
phases of meaning. "Date of issue" when applied to
notes, bonds, etc., of a series, usually means the arbitrary
date fixed as the beginning of the term for which they run,
without reference to the precise time when convenience or
the state of the market may permit of their sale or deliv-
ery. When the bonds are delivered to the purchaser, they
will be "Issued" to him, which is the other meaning of the
term. Turner v. Roseberry Irr. Dist., 33 Idaho, 746, 198 P.
465, 467. See, also, Anderson v. Mutual Life Ins. Co. of
New York, 164 Cal. 712, 130 P. 726, 727, Ann.Cas.1914B, 903.

## ISSUE

The act of issuing, sending forth, emit-
ting or promulgating; the giving a thing its first
inception; as the issue of an order or a writ.
Pleading
A single, certain, and material point, deduced by
the pleadings of the parties, which is affirmed on
the one side and denied on the other. Whitney v.
Borough of Jersey Shore, 266 Pa. 537, 109 A. 767,
769; Village of Oak Park v. Eldred, 265 Ill. 605,
107 N.E. 145, 146. A single certain and material
point arising out of the allegations of the parties,
and it should generally be made up of an affirma-
tive and a negative. Cowen Co. v. Houck Mfg. Co.,
C.C.A.N.Y., 249 F. 285, 287; Simmons v. Hagner,
140 Md. 248, 117 A. 759, 760. A fact put in con-
troversy by the pleadings. Shea v. Hillsborough
Mills, 78 N.H. 57, 96 A. 293, 294.
The disputed point or question to which the parties in an
action have narrowed their several allegations, and upon
which they are desirous of obtaining the decision of the
proper tribunal. When the plaintiff and defendant have
arrived at some specific point or matter affirmed on the
one side, and denied on the other, they are said to be at
issue. Knaggs v. Cleveland-Cliffs Iron Co., C.C.A.Ohio,
287 F. 314, 316; First Nat. Bank v. District Court of Har-
din County, 193 Iowa, 561, 187 N.W. 457, 458. (But as used
in a rule of. court, a case is not "at issue" where nothing
but a demurrer has been filed, presenting no issue except a
question of law as to the sufficiency of the complaint.
Arnett v. Hardwick, 27 Ariz. 179, 231 P. 922, 923.) The
question so set apart is called the "issue," and is desig-
nated, according to its nature, as an "issue in fact" or ah
"issue in law " Brown ; Martin v. City of Columbus, 101
Ohio St. 1, 127 N.E. 411, 413.
Issues arise upon the pleadings, when a fact or conclu-
sion of law is maintained by the one party and contro-
verted by the other. They are of two kinds : (1) of law;
and (2) of fact. Rev.Code Iowa 1880, § 2737 (Rules of Civil
Procedure, Rule 176); Code Civ.Proc.Cal. § 588; Comp.St.
Wyo.1910, § 4451 (Rev.St.1931, § 89-1202); Berglar v. Uni-
versity City, Mo.App., 190 S.W. 620, 622; General Electric
Co. v. Sapulpa & I. Ry. Co., 49 Okl. 376, 153 P. 189, 193.
The entry of the pleadings. 1 Chitty, P1. 630.
Issues are classified and distinguished as fol-
lows:
General and special. The former is a plea which
traverses and denies, briefly and in general and
summary terms, the whole declaration, indictment,
or complaint, without tendering new or special
matter. Steph. Pl. 155; Tilden v. E. A. Stevenson
& Co., 3 W.W.Harr. 151, 132 A. 739, 740; McAllis-
ter v. State, 94 Md. 290, 50 A. 1046; Standard Loan
& Acc. Ins. Co. v. Thornton, 97 Tenn. 1, 40 S.W.
136. Examples of the general issue are "not guil-
ty," "non assumpsit," "nil debet," "non est fac-
tum." The latter is formed when the defendant
chooses one single material point, which he tra-
verses, and rests his whole case upon its deter-
mination.
Identical. Issues determined by same ques-
tions of fact and of law. Allbee v. Elms, 93 N.H.
202, 37 A.2d 790, 791.
Material and immaterial. They are so described
according as they do or do not bring up some ma-
terial point or question which, when determined
by the verdict, will dispose of the whole merits of
the case, and leave no uncertainty as to the judg-
ment. Pearson v. Pearson, 104 Misc. 675, 173 N.Y.
S. 563, 565.
Formal and informal. The former species of is-
sue is one framed in strict accordance with the
technical rules of pleading. The latter arises
when the material allegations of the declaration
are traversed, but in an inartificial or untechnical
mode. In the latter case, the defect is cured by
verdict, by the statute 32 Hen. VIII. c. 30.
A collateral issue is an issue taken upon matter
aside from the intrinsic merits of the action, as
upon a plea in abatement; or aside from the di-
rect and regular order of the pleadings, as on a
demurrer. 2 Archb. Pr. K. B. 1, 6, bk. 2, pts. 1, 2;
Strickland v. Maddox, 4 Ga. 394. The term "col-
lateral" is also applied in England to an issue
raised upon a plea of diversity of person, pleaded
by a criminal who has been tried and convicted,
in bar of execution, viz., that he is not the same
person who was attainted, and the like. 4 Bl.
Comm. 396. Matters collateral to the main issue
are those which do not constitute an essential ele-
ment of the offense embraced within the charge.
State v. English, 308 Mo. 695, 274 S.W. 470, 474.
Real or feigned. A real or actual issue is one
formed in a regular manner in a regular suit for
the purpose of determining an actual controversy.
A feigned issue is one made up by direction of the
court, upon a supposed case, for the purpose of
obtaining the verdict of a jury upon some question
of fact collaterally involved in the cause. Such
issues are generally ordered by a court of equity,
to ascertain the truth of a disputed fact. They
are also used in courts of law, by the consent of
the parties, to determine some disputed rights
without the formality of pleading; and by this
practice much time and expense are saved in the
decision of a cause. 3 Bla.Comm. 452. The name
is a misnomer, inasmuch as the issue itself is upon
a real, material point in question between the par-
ties, and the circumstances only are fictitious.
Common issue is the name given to the issue
raised by the plea of non est factum to an action
for breach of covenant.
Ultimate issue signifies either such an issue as
within itself is sufficient and final for the disposi-
tion of the entire case or one which in connection
with other issues will serve such end. First State
Bank of Seminole v. Dillard, Tex.Civ.App., 71 S.
W.2d 407, 410.
This is so called because it denies the deed only, and not
the breach, and does not put the whole declaration in
issue, and because there is no general issue to this form of
action. 1 Chitty, P1. 482; Gould, Pl. c. 6, pt. 1, 1 7.
Realty Law
Descendants. All persons who have descended
from a common ancestor. Edmundson v. Leigh,
189 N.C. 196, 126 S.E. 497, 499, Offspring; progeny;
descent; lineage; lineal descendants. Gardner
v. Anderson, 114 Kan. 778, 227 P. 743, 747; In re
Schuster's Will, 111 Misc. 534, 181 N.Y.S. 500, 503;
Wilkins v. Rowan, 107 Neb. 180, 185 N.W. 437, 439;

R.I. 161, 106 A. 149, 153, 5 A.L.R. 185; Hoadley v.
Beardsley, 89 Conn. 270, 93 A. 535, 538; Turner v.
Monteiro, 127 Va. 537, 103 S.E. 572, 575, 13 A.L.R.
383; In re Book's Will, 89 N.J.Eq. 509, 105 A. 878,
879; 3 Ves. 257; 17 Ves. 481; 19 Ves. 547; 1 Rop.
Leg. 90.
In this sense, the word includes not only a child or chil-
dren, but all other descendants in whatever degree; and it
is so construed generally in deeds. But, when used in
wills, it is, of course, subject to the rule of construction
that the intention of the testator, as ascertained from the
will, is to have effect, rather than the technical meaning of
the language used by him; and hence issue may, in such a
connection, be restricted to children, or to descendants liv-
ing at the death of the testator, where such an intention
clearly appears. Abbott; Sibley v. Perry, 7 Ves.Jun. 523,
529; Ralph v. Carrick, 11 Ch.D. 873, 883; Barmore v. Dar-
ragh, Tex.Civ.App., 231 S.W. 472, 479; Newcomb v. New-
comb, 197 Ky. 801, 248 S.W. 198, 200; Horner v Haase, 177
Iowa 115, 158 N.W. 548, 549; In re Rynear's Estate, 224
N.Y.S. 606, 607, 130 Misc. 804.
The word "issue" in a will is generally a word of limita-
tion, In re Packer's Estate, 246 Pa. 116, 92 A. 70, 74; Bax-
ter v. Early, 131 S.C. 374, 127 S.E. 607; Bonnycastle v.
Lilly, 153 Ky. 834, 156 S.W. 874, L.R.A.1916B, 1076; and
when so used, is sometimes said to be equivalent to "heirs
of the body" ; Rhode Island Hospital Trust Co. v. Bridg-
ham, 42 R.I. 161, 106 A. 149, 152, 5 A.L.R. 185; Parrish v.
Hodges, 178 N.C. 133, 100 S.E. 256; Middletown Trust Co.
v. Gaffey, 96 Conn. 61, 112 A. 689, 690. But it has been
pointed out in other cases that this word is not as strong 'a
word of limitation as the words "heirs of the body,"
Adams v. Verner, 102 S.C. 7, 86 S.E. 211, 214; City Nat.
Bank v. Slocum, C.C.A.Ohio, 272 F. 11, 18; and yields
readily to a context indicating its use as a word of pur-
chase, Stout v. Good, 245 Pa. 383, 91 A. 613, 615; Evers-
meyer v. McCollum, 171 Ark. 117, 283 S.W. 379, 382; Ford
v. McBrayer, 171 N. C. 420, 88 S.E. 736, 737; Yarrington v.
Freeman, 201 Ky. 135, 255 S.W. 1034.
The word is commonly held to include only legitimate
issue. Page v. Roddie, 92 Okl. 236, 218 P. 1092, 1095; King
v. Thissell, 222 Mass. 140, 109 N.E. 880; Hardesty v. Mitch-
ell, 302 369, 134 N.E. 745, 746, 24 A.L.R. 565; Love v.
Love, 179 N.C. 115, 101 S.E. 562, 563; contra: Eaton v.
Eaton, 88 Conn. 286, 91 A. 196, 198.
Business Law

prising all that are emitted at one and the same
time.

## ISSUE IN FACT

In pleading. An issue taken
upon or consisting of matter of fact, the fact only,
and not the law, being disputed, and which is to
be tried by a jury. 3 Bl.Comm. 314, 315; Co. Litt.
126a; 3 Steph.Comm. 572. An issue which arises
upon a denial in the answer of a material allega-
tion of the complaint or in the reply of a material
allegation in the answer. Rev. Codes, Mont. §
6793 (Rev. Code 1921, § 9395). See, also, Code Civ.
Proc. Cal. § 590; Comp. St. Wyo. 1910, § 4452 (Rev.
St. 1931, § 89-1203).
The "issues of fact" which, if presented by the pleadings
and supported by evidence, must be submitted to the jury,
where requested, are only the independent ultimate facts
which go to make up plaintiff's cause of action and defend-
ant's ground of defense. Texas City Transp. Co. v. Win-
ters, Tex.Com.App., 222 S.W. 541, 542.

## ISSUE IN LAW

In pleading. An issue upon
matter of law, or consisting of matter of law, be-
ing produced by a demurrer on the one side, and a
joinder in demurrer on the other. 3 Bl.Comm.
314; 3 Steph.Comm. 572, 580; Code Civ. Proc. Cal.
§ 589. The term "issue" may be so used as to in-
clude one of law raised by demurrer to the com-
plaint, as well as one raised by answer. Fruth v.
Bolt, 39 S.D. 371, 164 N.W. 270, 271.

## ISSUE ROLL

In English practice. A roll upon
which the issue in actions at law was formerly
required to be entered, the roll being entitled of
the term in which the issue was joined. 2 Tidd
Pr. 733. It was not, however, the practice to enter
the issue at full length, if triable by the country,
until after the trial, but only to make an incipitur
on the roll. Id. 734. It was abolished by the rules
of Hilary Term, 1834. Moz. & W. Diet.

## ISSUES

In English law. The goods and profits
of the lands of a defendant against whom a writ
taken by virtue of such writ. 3 Bl.Comm. 280;

comprehend every available return therefrom,
whether it arise above or below the surface.

N.Y., 374, 380; Hemphill's Appeal, 18 Pa. 306;
Monson v. Chester, 22 Pick., Mass., 389. The law
must be obeyed notwithstanding the apparent
rigor of its application. 3 Bl.Comm. 430. We must
be content with the law as it stands, without in-
quiring into its reasons. 1 Bl.Comm. 32.

## ITA QUOD

and all the saints. Willes, 338.
ITA UTERE TUO UT ALIENUM NON LIEDAS.

such a way that you will not hurt your neighbor,
or prevent him from enjoying his. Frequently
written, "Sic utere tuo," etc. (q. v.).

mark the beginning of a new paragraph or divi-
application of it to denote a separate or distinct

## ITER

Lat.
In the Civil law. A way; a right of way belong-
ing as a servitude to an estate in the country,
(prcedium rusticum.) The right of way was of
three kinds: (1) iter, a right to walk, or ride on
horseback, or in a litter; (2) actus, a right to
drive a beast or vehicle; (3) via, a full right of
way, comprising right to walk or ride, or drive
beast or carriage. Heinec. § 408. Or, as some
think, they were distinguished by the width of the
objects which could be rightfully carried over the
way; e. g., via, 8 feet; actus, 4 feet, etc. Mackeld.
Rom. Law, § 290; Bract. fol. 232; 4 Bell, H. L.
Sc. 390.
In old English law. A journey, especially a cir-
