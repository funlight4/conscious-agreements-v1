purpose of the journey. Texas & P. Ry. Co. v..
Bryant, Tex.Civ.App., 11 S.W.2d 659, 660
Thus, jewelry suitable to the condition in life of the pas-
senger and intended for personal use on the journey is

248 S.W. 897. But it is not baggage where carried by a

## BAIL

To procure the release of a person from
legal custody, by undertaking that he shall appear
at the time and place designated and submit him-
self to the jurisdiction and judgment of the court.
To deliver the defendant to persons who, in the
manner prescribed by law, become security for
his appearance in court. To set at liberty a per-
son arrested or imprisoned, on security being taken
for his appearance on a day and a place certain,
which security is called "bail," because the party
arrested or imprisoned is delivered into the hands
of those who bind themselves for his forthcoming,
(that is, become bail for his due appearance when
required,) in order that he may be safely pro-
tected from prison. Wharton. Stafford v. State,
10 Tex.App. 49.
To procure release of one charged with an offense by
insuring his future attendance in court and compelling
him to remain within jurisdiction of court. Manning v.
State ex rel. Williams, 190 Okl. 65, 120 P.2d 980, 981.
The object of "bail" in civil cases is either directly or
indirectly to secure payment of a debt or performance of
other civil duties, while in criminal cases object is to
secure appearance of principal before the court when his
presence is needed. Johnson v. Shaffer, 64 Ohio App. 236,
28 N.E.2d 765, 767. In its more ancient signification, the
word includes the delivery of property, real or personal, by
one person to another.

## BAIL

The surety or sureties who procure the
release of a person under arrest, by becoming re-
sponsible for his appearance at the time and
place designated. Those persons who become
sureties for the appearance of the defendant in
court.
—Bail above or bail to the action. See Special bail,
ditioned upon the failure of the principal to duly
account for money coming to his hands as admin-
istrator, guardian, etc.
—Bail below, or bail to the sheriff. See Bail to the
sheriff or bail below, infra.
—Bail bond. A bond executed by a defendant who
has been arrested, together with other persons as
sureties, naming the sheriff, constable, or marshal
as obligee, in a penal sum proportioned to the
damages claimed or penalty denounced, condi-
tioned that the defendant shall duly appear to
answer to the legal process in the officer's hands,
or shall cause special bail to be put in, as the case
may be.
An obligation signed by the accused with sure-
ties, conditioned that the same shall be void on the
performance by the accused of such acts as he is
required to perform. State v. Wilson, 265 Mo. 1,
175 S.W. 603, 605.
Its purpose is to secure the presence of the one charged
in court when his presence is required in order to answer
to the charge. State v. Clark, 234 Iowa 338, 11 N.W.2d 722.
In criminal cases, a bail bond is a contract under seal,
which, from its nature, requires sureties or bail, and there-
fore differs from a "recognizance," which is a debt or obli-
gation of record, acknowledged before some court or mag-
istrate authorized to take it, with condition to do some
particular act, and which need not be executed by the par-
ties. State v. Bradsher, 189 N.C. 401, 127 S.E. 349, 351, 38
A.L.R. 1102. But under the law of Connecticut, "recog-
nizance" and "bail" are interchangeable. National Surety
Co. v. Nazzaro, 239 Mass. 341, 132 N.E. 49, 50.
—Bail common. A fictitious proceeding, intended
only to express the appearance of a defendant, in
cases where special bail is not required. It is put
in in the same form as special bail, but the sure-
ties are merely nominal or imaginary persons, as
John Doe and Richard Roe. 3 Bl.Comm. 287.
—Bail court. In English law and practice. An
auxiliary court of the court of queen's bench at
Westminster, wherein points connected more par-
ticularly with pleading and practice are argued
and determined. Holthouse; Wharton, Law Dict.
2d Lond. ed. It has been abolished.
—Bail dock. Formerly at the Old Bailey, in
London, a small room taken from one of the
corners of the court, and left open at the top, in
which certain malefactors were placed during
trial. Cent. Dict.
—Bail in error. That given by a defendant who
intends to bring a writ of error on the judgment
and desires a stay of execution in the meantime.
—Bail piece. A formal entry or memorandum of
the recognizance or undertaking of special bail in
civil actions, which, after being signed and ac-
knowledged by the bail before the proper officer,
is filed in the court in which the action is pending.
3 Bl.Comm. 291; Worthen v. Prescott, 60 Vt. 68,
11 Atl. 690.
—Bail to the action or bail above. Special bail (q.
v.).
—Bail to the sheriff or bail below. Persons who
swer the plaintiff; such undertaking being in the
form of a bond given to the sheriff, termed a
"bail bond" (q. v.). 3 Bl.Comm. 290; 1 Tidd, Pr.
221. Sureties who bind themselves to the sheriff
to secure the defendant's appearance, or his put-
ting in bail to the action on the return-day of the
writ.
"Bail to the sheriff was originally designed to tempo-
rarily liberate the defendant from close custody, and to
place means in the sheriff's hands to insure the defend-
ant's appearance to answer at the return of the writ.
• • • The appearance which was contemplated was not,
however, necessarily an actual appearance in person, but
by putting in new bail, called bail to the action, special
bail, or bail above. This special bail, or bail above, was
by recognizance, which was matter of record, and an act
of appearance, and by it the bail were bound that if the
defendant should be condemned he should pay or render
himself a prisoner, and if he did not, that they would pay
the condemnation. The undertaking of the ball to the
sheriff, or bail below, was wholly different, and was
adapted to the specific exigency. It was in the form of a
bond to the sheriff, and was conditioned for the defend=
ant's appearance at the return of the writ, which meant
putting in and perfecting bail above." De Myer v. McGon-
egal, 32 Mich. 120, 124.
—Civil bail. That taken in civil actions.
—Common bail. Fictitious sureties formally en.
tered in the proper office of the court. See Bail
common, supra.
—Special bail. Responsible sureties who under-
take as bail above. Persons who undertake joint-
ly and severally in behalf of a defendant arrested
on mesne process in a civil action that, if he be
condemned in the action, he shall pay the costs
and condemnation, (that is, the amount which
may be recovered against him,) or render himself
a prisoner, or that they will pay it for him. 3 Bl.
Comm. 291; 1 Tidd, Pr. 245; Sellon, Pr. 137. See
Bail to the sheriff or bail below, supra.
—Straw bail. Nominal or worthless bail. Irre-
sponsible persons, or men of no property, who
make a practice of going bail for any one who
will pay them a fee therefor, and who originally,
as a mark of their purpose, wore straw in their
shoes.

## BAILMENT

A delivery of goods or personal prop-
erty, by one person to another, in trust for the
execution of a special object upon or in relation
to such goods, beneficial either to the bailor or
bailee or both, and upon a contract, express or
implied, to perform the trust and carry out such
object, and thereupon either to redeliver the goods
to the bailor or otherwise dispose of the same in
conformity with the purpose of the trust. Fulcher
v. State, 32 Tex.Cr.R. 621, 25 S.W. 625.
A delivery of goods for some purpose, upon a contract,
express or implied, that after the purpose has been ful-
filled they shall be redelivered to the bailor, or otherwise
dealt with according to his direction, or kept until
reclaimed. In re George L. Nadell & Co., 294 Mich. 150,
292 N.W. 684, 686. A delivery of something of a personal
delivered over when that purpose is accomplished. Hardin
v. Grant. Tex.Civ.App.. 54 S.W.2d 189, 190; Hogan v.
O'Brien, 206 N.Y.S. 831, 833, 123 Misc. 865. The term
"bailment" is derived from the French word "bailler,"
meaning "to deliver." It imports a delivery of personal
property by one person to another m trust for a specific
purpose, with a contract, expressed o implied, that the
trust shall be faithfully executed and the property re-
turned or duly accounted for when the specific purpose
is accomplished or kept until bailor claims it. Common-
wealth v. Polk, 256 Ky. 100, 75 S.W.2d 761, 764.
According to Story, the contract does not necessarily
imply an undertaking to redeliver the goods. On the other
hand, Blac:istone, although his definition does not include
the return, speaks of it in all his examples of bailments as
a duty of the bailee; and Kent says that the application
of the term to cases in which no return or redelivery to the
owner or his agent is contemplated, is extending the defini-
tion of the term beyond its ordinary acceptation in English
law. A consignment to a factor would be a bailment for
sale, according to Story; while according to Kent it would
not.
Classification
Sir William Jones has divided bailments into
five sorts, namely: Depositum, or deposit; man-
datum, or commission without recompense; com-
modatum, or loan for use without pay; pignori
acceptum, or pawn; locatum, or hiring, which is
always with reward. This last is subdivided into
locatio rei, or hiring, by which the hirer gains a
temporary use of the thing; locatio operis facien-
di, when something is to be done to the thing de-
livered; locatio operis mercium vehendarum, when
the thing is merely to be carried from one place
to another. Jones, Bailm, 36.
Lord Holt divided bailments thus:
(1) Depositum, or a naked bailment of goods, to be kept
for the use of the bailor.
(2) Commodatum. Where goods or chattels that are use-
ful are lent to the bailee gratis, to be used by him.
(3) Locatio rei. Where goods are lent to the bailee to
be used by him for hire.
(4) Vadium. Pawn or pledge.
(5) Locatio operis faciendi. Where goods are delivered
to be carried, or something is to be done about them, for
a reward to be paid to the bailee.
(6) Mandatum. A delivery of goods to somebody who is
to carry them, or do something about them, gratis. 2 Ld.
Raym. 909.
Another division, suggested by Bouvier as being a better
general division for practical purposes, is as follows :
First, those bailments which are for the benefit of the
bailor, or of some person whom he represents; second,
those for the benefit of the bailee, or some person repre-
sented by him; third, those which are for the benefit of
both parties.
In General
—Bailment for hire. A contract in which the
bailor agrees to pay an adequate recompense for
the safe-keeping of the thing intrusted to the cus-
tody of the bailee, and the bailee agrees to keep
it and restore it on the request of the bailor, in
the same condition substantially as he received
it, excepting injury or loss from causes for which
he is not responsible.
—Bailment for mutual benefit. One in which
the parties contemplate some price or compensa-
tion in return for benefits flowing from the bail-
ment, necessarily involving an express or im-
plied agreement or undertaking to that effect.
Armored Car Service, Inc. v. First Nat. Bank of
delivery of automobile to one who, for a consider-
ation, undertakes to repair it. Fox Chevrolet Sales,
Inc. v. Middleton, to Use of Farm Bureau Mut.
Auto. Ins. Co., 99 A.2d 731, 732, 203 Md. 158, 43
A.L.R.2d 399.
—Actual bailment. One which exists where there
is either (a) an "actual delivery," consisting in
giving to the bailee or his agent the real posses-
sion of the chattel, or ( b) a "constructive de-
livery," consisting of any of those acts which,
although not truly comprising real possession of
the goods transferred, have been held by legal
construction equivalent to acts of real delivery.
Wentworth v. Riggs, 159 App.Div. 899, 143 N.Y.S.
955, 956.
—Constructive bailment. One arising where the
person having possession of a chattel holds it
under such circumstances that the law imposes
upon him the obligation to deliver it to another.
Wentworth v. Riggs, 159 App.Div. 899, 143 N.Y.S.
955, 956. See, also, Involuntary bailment, infra.
—Gratuitous bailment. Another name for a
depositum or naked bailment, which is made only
for the benefit of the bailor and is not a source of
profit to the bailee. Foster v. Essex Bank, 17
Mass. 499, 9 Am.Dec. 168.
—Involuntary bailment. One arising by the acci-
dental leaving of personal property in the posses-
sion of any person without negligence on the part
of its owner. Grossman Co. v. White, 52 Okl. 117,
152 P. 816, 817
A "bailment" Is created by the element of lawful pos-
session and the duty to act for the thing as the property
of another, whether such possession is based on contract
in the ordinary sense or not. Foulke v. New York Consol.
R. Co., 228 N.Y. 269, 127 N.E. 237, 239, 9 A.L.R. 1384. See
Constructive bailment, supra.
—Lucrative bailment. One which is undertaken
upon a consideration and for which a payment or
recompense is to be made to the bailee, or from
which he is to derive some advantage. Prince v.
Alabama State Fair, 106 Ala. 340, 17 So. 449, 28
L.R.A. 716.
—Bailment lease. A legal metnod by which one
desiring to purchase an article but unable to pay
therefor at the time, may secure possession there-
of with the right to use and enjoy it as long as
he pays stipulated rentals and becomes absolute
owner after completing such installment pay-
ments, on payment of an additional sum which
may be nominal. In re Robinson, D.C.Pa., 40 F.
Supp. 320, 322, 323.
Bailments as Distinguished from Other
Transactions
—Chattel mortgages. A radical distinction be-
tween a bailment and a chattel mortgage is that,
by a mortgage, the title is transferred to the
mortgagee, subject to be revested by performance
of the condition, but, in case of a bailment, the
bailor retains the title and parts with the pos-
session for a special purpose. Walker v. Staples, 5
Allen (Mass.) 34.
restore the specific thing received, or of returning
others of equal value, is the distinction between a
"bailment" and a "debt." Alamitos Land Co. v.
Texas Co., 11 Cal.App.2d 614, 54 P.2d 489, 491.
—Exchanges. An agreement by which A is to
let B have a horse, in consideration that B will
let A have another horse, creates an exchange,
not a bailment. Austin v. Seligman, C.C.N.Y., 21
Blatchf. 506, 18 Fed. 519.
—Partnerships. Where animals are delivered to
be taken care of for a certain time, and at the
expiration of that time the same number of ani-
mals is to be returned, and any increase is to be
enjoyed by both parties, there is a bailment, not a
partnership. Simmons v. Shaft, 91 Kan. 553, 138
P. 614, 615.
—Sales. The test of a bailment is that the iden-
tical thing is to be returned in the same or in some
altered form; if another thing of equal value is
to be returned, the transaction is a sale. Sturm v.
Boker, 14 S.Ct. 99, 150 U.S. 312, 37 L.Ed. 1093;
Borman v. U. S., C.C.A.N.Y., 262 F. 26, 29.
Conditional sale. Contemplates that at some time the
title shall pass to the purchaser and that he shall pay the
purchase price, while a "bailment" contemplates that the
title shall not pass to the bailee, but remain in the bailor,
and that the property shall be returned to the bailor. Ver-
mont Acceptance Corporation v. Wiltshire, 103 Vt. 219, 153
A. 199, 200, 73 A.L.R. 792.
—.Trusts. The passing of the legal title from the
owner to the party to whom personal property is
delivered distinguishes a "trust" from a bailment.
National Cattle Loan Co. v. Ward, 113 Tex. 312,
255 S.W. 160, 164; McIntyre v. Smith, 154 Md.
660, 141 A. 405, 410.

land, on which vegetation appropriate to such land in the
particular locality grows wherever the bank is not too
steep to permit such growth, and bed is soil of a different

ing in notes, foreign and domestic bills of exchange, coin,
bullion, credits, and the remission of money; or with both
these powers, and with the privileges, in addition to these
basic powers, of receiving special deposits and making col-
lections for the holders of negotiable paper, if the institu-
tion sees fit to engage in such business. State of Kansas
ex rel. Boynton v. Hayes, C.C.A.Kan., 62 F.2d 597, 600.
The term "bank" is usually restricted in its application
to an incorporated body; while a private individual mak-
ing it his business to conduct banking operations is gen-
erally denominated a "banker." Hobbs v. Bank, C.C.A.
N.Y., 101 F. 75, 41 C.C.A. 205; Wells, Fargo & Co. v.
Northern Pac. R. Co., C.C.Or., 23 F. 469.
The house or place where the business of bank-
ing is carried on.
Banks in the commercial sense are of three kinds, viz. :
(1) of deposit; (2) of discount; (3) of circulation. Strict-
ly speaking, the term "bank" implies a place for the de-
posit of money, as that is the most obvious purpose of
such an institution. Originally the business of banking
consisted only in receiving deposits, such as bullion, plate,
and the like, for safe-keeping until the depositor should
see fit to draw it out for use, but the business, in the
progress of events, was extended, and bankers assumed to
discount bills and notes, and to loan money upon mort-
gage, pawn, or other security, and, at a still later period,
to issue notes of their own, intended as a circulating cur-
rency and a medium of exchange, instead of gold and sil-
ver. Modern bankers frequently exercise any two or even
all three of those functions, but it is still true that an in-
stitution prohibited from exercising any more than one
of those functions is a bank, in the strictest commercial
y
sense. Oulton v. German Sa . & L. Soc., 17 Wall. 118, 21
L.Ed. 618; Millikan v. Security Trust Co., 118 N.E. 568,

banking transactions by member banks of the
Federal Reserve System. Normal banking func-
tions were resumed on March 13, subject to cer-
tain restrictions. The first proclamation, it was
held, had no authority in law until the passage
on March 9, 1933, of a ratifying act (12 U.S.C.A. §
95b). Anthony v. Bank of Wiggins, 183 Miss.

## BANK NIGHT

A device by which a theater pro-
vides a registration book which any person over
eighteen years of age, whether a patron of the
theater or not, may sign. The book is placed in
the lobby or outside the doors of the theater and
no charge is made for registration nor need one
who does so buy a ticket to the theater. A num-
ber is given to each name. On stated occasions,
the numbers representing all the names regis-
tered are placed in a container on the stage of
the theater and one number is drawn. The name
of the person having that registration number is
announced both inside and outside the theater
and on coming forward within a certain time, he
receives a sum of money which the theater pro-
vides from its own funds. If the person whose
number is drawn is outside the theater, he is per-
mitted to enter and claim the award without pay-
ing the admission. If he does not come forward
within the time set, the money is added to the
sum to be awarded on the next bank night. Un-
der the plan, various safeguards are thrown about
the operation to insure fairness in the allotment
of the money. State v. Dorau, 124 Conn. 160, 198
A. 573, 574. If not a lottery, a bank night is at
least a gift enterprise. Barker v. State, 56 Ga.
App. 705, 193 S.E. 605, 609. But it is generally
considered to be a lottery. State ex rel. Hunter
v. Fox Beatrice Theatre Corporation, 133 Neb.

ment Co., 128 N.J.L. 311, 25 A.2d 892, 893; Com-
monwealth v. Lund, 142 Pa.Super. 208, 15 A.2d
839, 846.
checks, bank bills, drafts, and other securities for
money, received as cash by the banks. The term
does not necessarily mean discountable paper, but
paper of such high credit that, if the time of pay-
ment was reasonable and the banks had loanable
funds, they would ordinarily discount it. Edward
P. Allis Co. v. Madison Electric Light, Heat &
Power Co., 9 S.D. 459, 70 N.W. 650, 652.
National bank notes are received as bankable money
without regard to the locality of the bank issuing them.

distinguished from a "private banker" (q. v.), is a
person who, having complied with the statutory
requirements, has received authority from the
state to engage in the business of banking, while

or property in his possession belonging to a cus-
tomer to the extinguishment of any matured debt
of such customer to the bank, provided such prop-
erty or money has not been charged, with the
knowledge of the bank, with the subservience of
a special burden or purpose, or does not constitute
a trust fund of which the banker has notice.
American Surety Co. of New York v. Bank of
Italy, 63 Cal.App. 149, 218 P. 466, 468.

## BANKER'S NOTE

deposit, losaning money, discounting notes, issuing
notes for circulation, collecting money on notes

The business of banking, as defined by law and custom,
consists in the issue of notes payable on demand intended
to circulate as money when the banks are banks of issue;
In receiving deposits payable on demand ; in discounting
commercial paper ; making loans of money on collateral
security; buying and selling bills of exchange; negotiat-
ing loans, and dealing in negotiable securities issued by

C.N.Y., 10 F.Supp. 33, 36.
Having a place of business where deposits are received
and paid out on checks and where money is loaned on
security is the substance of the "business of banking."

Div. 810, 142 N.Y.S. 440, 445.

## BANKRUPT

Originally and strictly, a trader
who secretes himself or does certain other acts
tending to defraud his creditors. 2 Bl.Comm. 471;
Shor v. McGregor, C.C.A.Tex., 108 F.2d 421, 423.
In a looser sense, an insolvent person; a broken-
up or ruined trader. Everett v. Stone, 3 Story,
453, Fed.Cas.No.4,577.
In the English law there were two characteristics which
distinguished bankrupts from insolvents : the former must
have been a trader and the object of the proceedings
against, not by, him. As used in American law, the dis-
tinction between a bankrupt and an insolvent is not gen-
erally regarded. Sturges v. Crowninshield, 4 Wheat. 122,
4 L.Ed. 529; 2 Kent, 390; McCormick v. Pickering, 4 N.Y.
283. On the continent of Europe, however, the distinction
still exists. Holtz.Enc. voc. sig. Bankerott.
A person who has committed an act of bank-
ruptcy; one who has done some act or suffered
some act to be done in consequence of which,
under the laws of his country, he is liable to be
proceeded against by his creditors for the seizure
and distribution among them of his entire prop-
erty. Ashby v. Steere, 2 Woodb. & M. 347, 2 Fed.
Cas. 15; In re Scott, 21 Fed.Cas. 803; U. S. v.
Pusey, 27 Fed.Cas. 632. For "Examination of
bankrupt", see Examination.
The term includes one against whom involuntary petition
has been filed. United States v. Agresti, C.C.A.N.Y., 130
F.2d 152, 153, 154.
has been declared subject to be proceeded against
under the bankruptcy laws, or entitled, on his vol-
untary application, to take the benefit of such
laws. See Bankruptcy Act July 1, 1898, c. 541, §
1, 30 Stat. 544 (11 USCA § 1).

## BANKRUPT LAW

A law for benefit and relief
of creditors and their debtors in cases in which
the latter are unable or unwilling to pay their
debts. Campbell v. Alleghany Corporation, C.C.
A.Md., 75 F.2d 947, 951.
A bankrupt law is distinguished from the ordinary law
between debtor and creditor, as involving these three gen-
eral principles : (1) A summary and immediate seizure of
all the debtor's property; (2) a distribution of it among
the creditors in general, instead of merely applying a por-
tion of it to the payment of the individual complainant;
and (3) the discharge of the debtor from future liability
for the debts then existing.
The leading distinction between a bankrupt law and an
insolvent law, in the proper technical sense, consists in the
character of the persons upon whom it is designed to op-
erate,—the former contemplating as its objects bankrupts
only, that is, traders of a certain description; the latter;
insolvents in general, or persons unable to pay their debts.
This has led to a marked separation between the two sys-
tems, in principle and in practice, which in England has
always been carefully maintained, although in the United
States it has of late been disregarded. A bankrupt law,
moreover, in its proper sense, is a remedy intended pri-
marily for the benefit of creditors; it is set In motion at
their instance, and operates upon the debtor against his
will, (in invitum,) although in its result it effectually dis-
charges him from his debts. An insolvent law, on the
other hand, is chiefly intended for the benefit of the debt-
or, and' is set in motion at his instance, though possibly
less effective as a discharge in its final result. Sturges
v. Crowninshield, 4 Wheat. 194, 4 L.Ed. 529; Vanuxen v.
Hazlehursts, 4 N.J.Law, 192, 7 Am.Dec. 582; Adams v.
Storey, 1 Paine, 79, 1 Fed.Cas. 142; Kunzler v. Kohaus, 5
Hill (N.Y.) 317.
The only substantial difference between a strictly bank-
rupt law and an insolvent law lies in the circumstance that
the former affords relief upon the application of the credi-
tor, and the latter upon the application of the debtor.
Martin v. Berry, 37 Cal. 222.

## BANKRUPTCY

The state or condition of one
who is a bankrupt; amenability to the bankrupt
laws; the condition of one who has committed
an act of bankruptcy, and is liable to be proceeded
against by his creditors therefor, or of one whose
circumstances are such that he is entitled, on his
voluntary application, to take the benefit of the
bankrupt laws.
The term is used in a looser sense as synony-
mous with "insolvency,"—inability to pay one's
debts; the stopping and breaking up of business
because the trader is broken down, insolvent,
ruined. Phipps v. Harding, C.C.A.Wis., 70 Fed.
468, 17 C.C.A. 203, 30 L.R.A. 513.
It constitutes a branch of equity jurisprudence. In re
Flour Mills of America, D.C.Mo., 27 F.Supp. 559, 560.
Its purpose is to secure finally to creditors distribution of
value of at least part of debtor's assets and to bankrupt
discharge from his debts, to end that creditors may be
paid as much as may be and that bankrupt may have new
start in life. In re Jones, D.C.Mo., 10 F.Supp. 165, 167.
Insolvency means a simple inability to pay as debts
should become payable, whereby the debtor's business
would be broken up; bankruptcy means the particular le-
gal status, to be ascertained and declared by a judicial de-
cree. In re Black, 2 Ben. 196, Fed.Cas.No.1,457.
The proceedings taken under the bankrupt law,
against a person (or firm or company) to have
administered for the benefit of the creditors, an
divided among them. That branch of jurispru
dence, or system of law and practice, which is con
cerned with the definition and ascertainment
acts of bankruptcy and the administration
bankrupts' estates for the benefit of their credi
tors and the absolution and restitution of bank
rupts.

Bankruptcy Proceedings
This term includes all proceedings in a feder

Voluntary Bankruptcy
Bankruptcy (in the sense of proceedings take

involuntary; the former where the proceedin
is initiated by the debtor's own petition to be ad
judged a bankrupt and have the benefit of th
law. In re Murray, D.C.Iowa, 96 F. 600; Metske
v. Bonebrake, 2 Sup.Ct. 351, 108 U.S. 66, 27 L.Ed
654, the latter where he is forced into bankruptc

lamation of a matrimonial contract, and the in-
tended celebration of the marriage of the parties
in pursuance of such contract. Cowell; 1 Bla.
. Comm. 439; Pothier, Du Man age p. 2, c. 2.
Such announcement is required by the English law to
be made in a church or chapel, during service, on three
consecutive Sundays before the marriage is celebrated.
The object is to afford an opportunity for any person to
interpose an objection if he knows of any impediment or
other just cause why the marriage should not take place.
- The publication of the banns may be dispensed with by
procuring a special license to marry.
]ANNUM. A ban (q. v.).

In East Indian law. A Hindoo mer-
chant or shop-keeper. The word is used in Bengal
e
to denote the native who manages the money con-
,
cerns of a European, and sometimes serves him
as an interpreter.
. BAR. A partition or railing running across a
f court-room, intended to separate the general
- public from the space occupied by the judges,
. counsel, jury, and others concerned in the trial
of a cause. In the English courts it is the parti-
member of the public must stand. Solicitors,
being officers of the court, are admitted within it;
as are also queen's counsel, barristers with pat-
ents of precedence, and serjeants, in virtue of
their ranks. Parties who appear in person also
are placed within the bar on the floor of the court.
A particular part of the court-room; for exam-
ple, the place where prisoners stand at their trial,
hence the expression "prisoner at the bar."
The court, in its strictest sense, sitting in full
term. The presence, actual or constructive, of the
court. Thus, a trial at bar is one had before the
full court, distinguished from a trial had before a
single judge at nisi prius. So the "case at bar" is
the case now before the court and under its con-
sideration; the case being tried or argued.
In another sense, the whole body of attorneys
and counsellors, or the members of the legal pro-
fession, collectively, who are figuratively called
the "bar," from the place which they usually oc-
cupy in court. They are thus distinguished from
the "bench," which term denotes the whole body
of judges.
In the practice of legislative bodies, the outer
boundary of the house; therefore, all persons,
not being members, who wish to address the
house, or are summoned to it, appear at the bar
for that purpose.
In the law of contracts, an impediment, obsta-
cle, or preventive barrier. -
Thus, relationship within the prohibited degrees is a bar
to marriage. In this sense also we speak of the "bar of
the statute of limitations."
That which defeats, annuls, cuts off, or puts an
end to.
Thus, a provision "in bar of dower" is one which has
the effect of defeating or cutting off the dower-rights
which the wife would otherwise become entitled to in the
particular land.
In pleading, a special plea, constituting a suffi-
cient answer to an action at law; so called be-
cause it barred, i. e., prevented, the plaintiff from
further prosecuting it with effect, and, if estab-
lished by proof, defeated and destroyed the ac-
tion altogether. Now called a special "plea in
bar." It may be further described as a plea or
peremptory exception of a defendant to destroy
the plaintiff's action. City of San Antonio v. John-

State v. Leftwich, 142 Wash. 329, 253 P. 448, 449, 59 A.L.R.

ping hair with barber clippers, singeing the hair, giving
tonics, shampooing, and manicuring, but not shaving the
face, was not a "barber" within a statute subjecting bar-

A contract or agreement between two parties,
the one to sell goods or lands, and the other to

As a verb, to sell for cash, or on terms, rather
than to trade or exchange. In re Wellings' Es-
tate, 197 Cal. 189, 240 P. 21, 24.
"If the word 'agreement' imports a mutual act of two
parties, surely the word 'bargain' is not less significative
of the consent of two. In a popular sense, the former
word is frequently used as declaring the engagement of
one only. A man may agree to pay money or to perform
some other act, and the word is then used synonymously.
with 'promise' or 'engage.' But the word 'bargain' is sel-
dom used, unless to express a mutual contract or under-
taking." Packard v. Richardson, 17 Mass. 131, 9 Am.Dec.
—Bargain money. These words in a contract for
the sale of land have much the same significance
as earnest money. Morgan v. Forbes, 236 Mass.

an heir or any one who has an estate in reversion
or expectancy, to be repaid on the vesting of his
interest; or a similar unconscionable bargain with
such person for the purchase outright of his ex-
pectancy. See Edler v. Frazier, 174 Iowa, 46, 156
N.W. 182, 187. That kind of fraud often perpe-
trated upon young, inexperienced, or ignorant
people. Provident Life & Trust Co. v. Fletcher,
C.C.A.N.Y., 258 F. 583, 586.
See Unconscionable Bargain
transferring of the property of a thing from one
to another, upon valuable consideration, by way
of sale. Shep.Touch. (by Preston,) 221.
A contract or bargain by the owner of land, in
consideration of money or its equivalent paid, to
sell land to another person, called the "bar-
gainee," whereupon a use arises in favor of the
latter, to whom the seisin is transferred by force
of the statute of uses. Laing v. McClung, 103 W.
Va. 341, 137 S.E. 744, 745.
The proper and technical words to denote a bargain and
sale are "bargain and sell ;" but any other words that are
sufficient to raise a use upon a valuable consideration are
sufficient. 2 Wood.Conv. 15; Jackson ex dem. Hudson v.
Alexander, 3 Johns. (N.Y.) 484, 3 Am.Dec. 517.

## BELLIGERENCY

In international law. The
status of de facto statehood attributed to a body
of insurgents, by which their hostilities are legal-
ized.
Before they can be recognized as belligerents they must
have some sort of political organization and be carrying on

must be an armed struggle between two political bodies,
each of which exercises de facto authority over persons
within a determined territory, and commands an army
which is prepared to observe the ordinary laws of war.

noun, it designates either of two nations which are

"Benefit" is not limited to pecuniary gains, nor to any

upon the surrender of his property for the benefit

## BENEFIT OF CLERGY

In its original sense, the
phrase denoted the exemption which was accorded
to clergymen from the jurisdiction of the secular
courts, or from arrest or attachment on criminal
process issuing from those courts in certain partic-
ular cases. Afterwards, it meant a privilege of
exemption from the punishment of death accorded
to such persons as were clerks, or who could
read. This privilege of exemption from capital
punishment was anciently allowed to clergymen
only, but afterwards to all who were connected
with the church, even to its most subordinate of-
ficers, and at a still later time to all persons who
could read, (then called "clerks,") whether ec-
clesiastics or laymen. It does not appear to have
been extended to cases of high treason, nor did
it apply to mere misdemeanors. The privilege
was claimed after the person's conviction, by a
species of motion in arrest of judgment, techni-
cally called "praying his clergy." As a means of
testing his clerical character, he was given a
psalm to read, (usually, or always, the fifty-first,)
and, upon his reading it correctly, he was turned
over to the ecclesiastical courts, to be tried by the
bishop or a jury of twelve clerks. These heard
him on oath, with his witnesses and compurga-
This privilege operated greatly to mitigate the ex-
treme rigor of the criminal laws, but was found to
involve such gross abuses that parliament began
to enact that certain crimes should be felonies
"without benefit of clergy," and finally, by St. 7
Geo. IV. c. 28, § 6, it was altogether abolished.
The act of congress of April 30, 1790, c. 9, § 31, 1
Stat. 119, provided that there should be no benefit
of clergy for any capital crime against the United
States, and, if this privilege formed a part of the
common law of the several states before the Rev-
olution, it no longer exists.

## BENEFIT OF COUNSEL

The guaranty of "ben-
efit of counsel" to accused, given in the Georgia
Bill of Rights of Const. art. 1, § 1, par. 5, means
more than the mere appointment by the court of
counsel to represent the accused and implies also
that such counsel be given a reasonable time for
preparation to properly represent the accused at
the trial. Reliford v. State, 140 Ga. 777, 79 S.E.
1128, 1129. Sheppard v. State, 165 Ga. 460, 141
S.E. 196, 198.

## BENEFIT OF DISCUSSION

In the civil law.
The right which a surety has to cause the prop-
erty of the principal debtor to be applied in satis-
faction of the obligation in the first instance.

similar names, in various states, corporations ex-
ist to receive periodical payments from members,
and hold them as a fund to be loaned or given
to members needing pecuniary relief. Such are
beneficial societies of Maryland, fund associations

chusetts, mechanics' associations of Michigan, pro-
tection societies of New Jersey. Friendly societies

important species belonging to this class. Comm.

Peabody's Estate, 208 N.Y.S. 664, 671, 124 Misc.
338. Also beneficent; doing well.
It is a broader term than "charity" which it includes,
and with which it is frequently used synonymously.
"Charity" in its legal sense implies giving without con-
sideration or expectation of return, and "benevolence" ap-
plies to any act which is prompted by or has for its object
the well-being of others. State v. Texas Mut. Life Ins. Co.
of Texas, Tex.Civ.App., 51 S.W.2d 405, 410.
In public law. Nominally a voluntary gratuity
given by subjects to their king, but in reality a
tax or forced loan. Cowell; 1 Bla.Comm. 140.

## BENEVOLENT

Philanthropic; humane; having
a desire or purpose to do good to men; intended
for the conferring of benefits, rather than for
gain or profit; loving others and actively desirous
of their well being. In re Altman's Estate, 149
N.Y.S. 601, 605, 87 Misc. 255.
.
This word is certainly more indefinite, and of far wider
range, than "charitable" or "religious ;" it would include
all gifts prompted by good-will or kind feeling towards
the recipient, whether an object of charity or not. The
natural and usual meaning of the word would so extend it.
It has no legal meaning separate from its usual meaning.
"Charitable" has acquired a settled limited meaning in
law, which confines it within known limits. But in all the
decisions in England on the subject it has been held that a
devise or bequest for benevolent objects, or in trust to give
to such objects, is too indefinite, and therefore void. Suter
v. Hilliard, 132 Mass. 413, 42 Am.Rep. 444;
This word, as applied to objects or purposes, may refer
to those which are in their nature charitable, and may
also have a broader meaning and include objects and pur-
poses not charitable in the legal sense of that word. Acts
of kindness, friendship, forethought, or good-will Might
properly be described as benevolent. It has therefore been
held that gifts to trustees to be applied for "benevolent
purposes" at their discretion, or to such benevolent pur-
poses as they could agree upon, do not create a public char-
ity. But where the word is used in connection with other
words explanatory of its meaning, and indicating the in-
tent of the donor to limit it to purposes strictly charitable,
it has been held to be synonymous with, or equivalent to,
"charitable." Suter v. Hilliard, 132 Mass. 412, 42 Am.Rep.
444;

## BENEVOLENT ASSOCIATIONS

Those having a
philanthropic or charitable purpose, as distin-
guished from such as are conducted for profit;
specifically, "benefit associations" or "beneficial
associations." Methodist Episcopal Church Bara-
ca Club v. City of Madison, 167 Wis. 207, 167 N.
W. 258, L.R.A.1918D, 1124.

## BENEVOLENT CORPORATION

One that min-
isters to all; the purpose may be anything that
promotes the mental, physical, or spiritual wel-
fare of man. Society of Helpers of Holy Souls v.
Law, 267 Mo. 667, 186 S.W. 718, 725; with respect
to exemption from succession tax. Corbin v.
American Industrial Bank & Trust Co., 95 Conn.
50, 110 A. 459, 461. The term may include a cor-
poration to which a bequest is made to be used in
the improvement of the social, physical, and eco-
nomic condition of the employees of a business
corporation. In re Altman's Estate, 149 N.Y.S.
601, 605, 87 Misc. 255.
tion. Spring Park Ass'n v. Rosedale Park Amuse-
ment Co., 216 Ala. 549, 114 So. 43, 44. In English.

lished and registered under the Friendly Societies

poses.

BENIGNE FACIENDIE SUNT INTERPRETA-
TIONES CHARTARUM, UT RES MAGIS VA-
LEAT QUAM PEREAT; ET QUE LIBET CON-
CESSIO FORTISSIME CONTRA DONATOREM
INTERPRETANDA EST. Liberal interpretations
are to be made of deeds, so that the purpose may
rather stand than fall; and every grant is to
be taken most strongly against the grantor.
Hayes v. Kershow, 1 Sandf.Ch. (N.Y.) 258, 268.
BENIGNE FACIENDIE SUNT INTERPRETA-
TIONES, PROPTER SIMPLICITATEM LAICOR-
UM, UT RES MAGIS VALEAT QUAM PEREAT;

## ET VERBA INTENTION!, NON E CONTRA, DE- BENT INSERVIRE

Constructions [of written
instruments] are to be made liberally, on account
of the simplicity of the laity, [or common peo-
ple,] in order that the thing [or subject-matter]
may rather have effect than perish, [or become
void] ; and words must be subject to the inten-
tion, not the intention to the words. 2 Bla.Com.
379; 1 Bulstr. 175; Krider v. Lafferty, 1 Whart.
(Pa.) an.
BENIGNIOR SENTENTIA IN VERBIS GEN-
ERALIBUS SEU DUBIIS, EST PRIEFERENDA.

## BEQUEATH

To give personal property by will
to another. Fielding v. Alkire, 124 Kan. 592, 261

v. Abel, 114 Or. 610, 233 P. 852, 857; Fleck v.
Harmstad, 155 A. 875, 876, 304 Pa. 302, 77 A.L.R.
But if the context clearly shows the intention of the
testator to use the word "bequeath" as synonymous with
"devise." it may be held to pass real property. Stubbs v.
Abel, 114 Or. 610, 233 P. 852, 859.

## BEQUEST

A gift by will of personal property;
a legacy. In re Fratt's Estate, 60 Mont. 526, 199
P. 711, 714; In re Wood's Estate, 6 N.W.2d 846,
termed "devise." Grand Island Trust Co. v. Snell,
249 N.W. 293, 125 Neb. 148.
The term does not mean a "gift" in the narrow sense of
a voluntary act of charity or good will, but ordinarily
means a testamentary disposition of the testator's person-
alty. First Presbyterian Church of Mt. Vernon v. Dennis,
178 Iowa, 1352, 161 N.W. 183, 185, L.R.A.1917C, 1005. It is
not necessarily limited to a gratuity, and may include a
recompense. U. S. v. Merriam, 44 S.Ct. 69, 70, 263 U.S.
179, 68 L. Ed. 240, 29 A.L.R. 1547.

ample:
The "best bid" of interest by a prospective depositary of

might be the lowest bid. Donna Independent School Dist.
v. First State Bank of Donna, Tex.Civ.App., 227 S.W. 974,
Where one covenants to use his "best endeavors," there

Nat. Bank of South Omaha v. Bragg, 67 Utah, 60, 245 P.
966, 971.

## BEST EVIDENCE

Primary evidence, as distin-
guished from secondary; original, as distin-
guished from substitutionary; the best and high-
est evidence of which the nature of the case is sus-
ceptible, not the highest or strongest evidence
which the nature of the thing to be proved admits
of. See, also, Primary Evidence.
A written instrument is itself always regarded as the
primary or best possible evidence of its existence and
contents; a copy, or the recollection of a witness, would
be secondary evidence. Manhattan Malting Co. v. Swete-
land, 14 Mont. 269, 36 P. 84.
"Best evidence" or "primary evidence" includes the best
evidence which is available to a party and procurable un-
der the existing situation, and all evidence falling short of
such standard, and which in its nature suggests there is
bettei evidence of the same fact, is "secondary evidence."
Best v. Equitable Life Assur. Soc., Mo.App., 299 S.W. 118,
The best evidence of a fact is the testimony of a person
who knows. State v. Normandale, 154 La. 523, 97 So. 798,
799 (mother could testify to the date of her daughter's
birth, as against an objection that the baptismal certifi-
cate or the registry was the best evidence).
"Best evidence rule". Is that highest available degree
of proof must be produced. Cheadle v. Bardwell, 95 Mont.
299, 26 P.2d 336. It means that no evidence which is mere-
ly substitutionary in its nature shall be received so long as
original evidence can be had; Pettit v. Campbell, Tex.Civ.
App., 149 S.W.2d 633, 635, 636; that contents of document
must be proved by producing document itself. Nunan v.
Timberlake, 85 F.2d 407, 410, 66 App.D.C. 150.

A contract by which two or more parties agree that a
sum of money, or other thing, shall be paid or delivered to
one of them on the happening or not happening of an un-
certain event. Grooms v. Knox, 25 Ala.App. 185, 142 So.
In a "bet" or "wager" money belongs to the persons
posting it, each of whom has a chance to win it, but, in
the case of a "purse" or "premium," money belongs to the
person offering it, who has no chance to win it, but is cer-
tain to lose it. Toomey v. Penwell, 76 Mont. 166, 245 P.
943, 945, 45 A.L.R. 993.
Bet and wager are synonymous terms. Woodcock v. Mc-

F. 386, 30 C.C.A. 108.

## BETWEEN

A space which separates. Hobson v.
Postal Telegraph-Cable Co., 161 Tenn. 419, 32 S.
ence to two things, but this may be understood as
including cases in which a number of things are
discriminated collectively as two wholes, or as tak-
en in pairs, or where one thing is set off against
a number of others. In re McShane's Will, 286
N.Y.S. 680, 682, 158 Misc. 777. Sometimes used
synonymously with "among". In re Moore's Es-
tate, 157 Pa.Super. 296, 43 A.2d 359.
As a measure or indication of distance, this word has
the effect of excluding the two termini. Morris & E. R.
Co. v. Central R. Co., 31 N.J.Law, 212.
If an act is to be done "between" two certain days, it
must be performed before the commencement of the latter
day. In computing the time in such a case, both the days
named are to be excluded. Hodges v. Filstrup, 94 Fla. 943,
114 So. 521, 522. But a clause in a contract of sale to the
effect that the purchaser could require the vendor to repur-
chase between the fifth and sixth year from a certain date
means during the sixth year. Van Demark v. California
Home Extension Ass'n, 43 Cal.App. 685, 185 P. 866, 868.
In case of a devise to A. and B. "between them," these

Burnstein v. U. S., C.C.A.Cal., 55 F.2d 599, 603.
Especially pleasant or refreshing drink, or a ha-
bitual one. Tennant v. F. C. Whitney & Sons, 133
Wash. 581, 234 P. 666, 670.
This term is properly used to distinguish a sale of liquors
to be drunk for the pleasure of drinking, from liquors to
be drunk in obedience to a physician's advice, Falstaff
Corporation v. Allen, D.C.Mo., 278 F. 643, 645; or from a
liquid which it is possible to swallow, but which is not rea-
sonably palatable or fit for drinking, Tennant v. F. C.
Whitney & Sons, 133 Wash. 581, 234 P. 666. Thus, it is
held that pure alcohol is not a "beverage" but a violent
irritant. Chas. L. Joy & Co. v. Carlson, 28 Idaho 445, 154
P. 640, 641.
This term sometimes has a narrower meaning signify-
ing a drink artificially prepared. Climax Dairy Co. v.

ason, D.C.Kan., 38 F.Supp. 991, 992.

table. Ferguson Packing Co. v. Mihalic, 99 Pa.Su-
per. 158, 162.
An accused's guilt must be established "beyond a rea-
sonable doubt," which means that facts proven must, by
virtue of their probative force, establish guilt. People ex
rel. Schubert v. Pinder, 9 N.Y.S.2d 311, 312, 170 Misc.

## BEYOND SEA

Beyond the limits of the kingdom
of Great Britain and Ireland; outside the United
States; out of the state.
Beyond sea, beyond the four seas, beyond the seas, and
out of the realm, are synonymous. Prior to the union of
the two crowns of England and Scotland, on the accession
of James I., the phrases "beyond the four seas," "beyond
the seas," and "out of the realm," signified out of the
limits of the realm of England. Pancoast's Lessee v. Addi-
son, 1 Han & J. (Md.) 350, 2 Am.Dec. 520.
In Pennsylvania, it has been construed to mean "with-
out the limits of the United States," which approaches the
literal signification. Ward v. Hallam, 2 Da11. 217, 1 L.1 d.
355. The same construction has been given to it in Mis-
souri. Keeton's Heirs v. Keeton's Adm'r, 20 'Mo. 530. See

ment and renders judge unable to exercise his
functions impartially in particular case. Evans v.
Superior Court in and for Los Angeles County, 107
Cal.App. 372, 290 P. 662, 665.
As used in law regarding disqualification of judge, refers
to mental attitude or disposition of the judge toward a
party to the litigation, and not to any views that he may
entertain regarding the subject matter involved. State ex
rel. Mitchell v. Sage Stores Co., 157 Kan. 622, 143 P.2d 652,
Actual bias consists in the existence of a state of mind
on the part of the juror which satisfies the court, in the
exercise of a sound discretion, that the juror cannot try the
issues impartially and without prejudice to the substantial
rights of the party challenging. People v. Wells, 100 Cal.
227, 34 P. 718.

Cas.1915C, 1008. A "bid" for bonds is no more nor less
than a proposition. Joint School Dist. No. 132 in Major
County and Alfalfa County v. Dabney, 127 Oki. 234, 260 P.
486, 491.
—Bid in. Property sold at auction is said to be
"bid in" by the owner or an incumbrancer or some
one else who is interested in it, when he attends
the sale and makes the successful bid.
—Bid off. One is said to "bid off" a thing when
he bids for it at an auction sale, and it is knocked
down to him in immediate succession to the bid
and as a consequence of it. Eppes v. Railroad

25 Pac. 883.
—Bidder. One who makes a bid. One who offers
to pay a specified price for an article offered for
sale at a public auction. Webster v. French, 11
Ill. 254. As to "Responsible bidder" see that title.
—Biddings. Offers of a designated price for goods
or other property put up for sale at auction.
—By-bidding. In the law relating to sales by auc-
tion, this term is equivalent to "puffing." The
practice consists in making fictitious bids for the
property, under a secret arrangement with the
owner or auctioneer, for the purpose of mislead-
ing and stimulating other persons who are bidding
in good faith.
—Competitive bidding. "Competitive bidding"
means that the council must by due advertise-
ment give opportunity for everyone to bid, but
does not mean that more than one bid must be
submitted. Blanton v. Town of Wallins, 218 Ky.
295, 291 S.W. 372, 375. The term means bidding
upon the same undertaking, upon the same ma-
terial items in the subject-matter, upon the same
thing. Leininger v. Ward, 126 Okl. 114, 258 P.
863, 864.
—Upset bid. A bid made after a judicial sale, but
before the successful bid at the sale has been con-
firmed, larger or better than such successful bid,
and made for the purpose of upsetting the sale
and securing to the "upset bidder" the privilege of
taking the property at his bid or competing at a
new sale. Yost v. Porter, 80 Va. 858.
BIDAL, or BIDALL. An invitation of friends to
drink ale at the house of some poor man, who
hopes thereby to be relieved by charitable con-
tribution. It is something like "house-warming,"
i. e., a visit of friends to a person beginning to
set up housekeeping. Wharton. See Bed-Ale.
"There was an antient Custom called a Bid-Ale
* * * when any honest Man decayed in his
Estate, was set up again by the liberal Benevo-
lence and Contributions of Friends at a Feast, to
which those Friends were bid or invited. It was
most used in the West of England, and in some
Counties called a Help Ale." Brand's Pop. Antiq.
(1777), p. 339, note.

## BIELBRIEF

Germ. In European maritime law.
A document furnished by the builder of a vessel,
containing a register of her admeasurement, par-
ticularizing the length, breadth, and dimensions of
every part of the ship.
It sometimes also contains the terms of akreement be-
tween the party for whose account the ship is built, and
the ship-builder. It has been termed in English the "grand
bill of sale ;" in French, "contrat de construction ou de la
vente d'un vaisseau," and corresponds in a great degree
with the English, French, and American "register," (q. v.,)
being an equally essential document to the lawful owner-
ship of vessels. Jac. Sea Laws, 12, 13, and note. In the
Danish law, it is used to denote the contract of bottomry.

## BIENES

Sp. In Spanish law. Goods; property
of every description, including real as well as
personal property; all things (not being persons)
which may serve for the uses of man. Larkin
v. U. S., 14 Fed.Cas. 1154.
—Bienes comunes. Common property; those
things which, not being the private property of
any person, are open to the use of all, such as the
air, rain, water, the sea and its beaches. Lux v.
Haggin, 69 Cal. 255, 315, 10 Pac. 707.
—Bienes ganariciales. A species of community in
property enjoyed by husband and wife, the prop-
erty being divisible equally between them on the
dissolution of the marriage; does not include what
they held as their separate property at the time of
contracting the marriage. Welder v. Lambert, 91
Tex. 510, 44 S.W. 281.
—Bienes publieos. Those things which, as to prop-
erty, pertain to the people or nation, and, as to
their use, to the individuals of the territory or
district, such as rivers, shores, ports, and public
roads. Lux v. Haggin, 69 Cal. 315, 10 P. 707.

## BIENNIALLY

This term, in a statute, signifies,
not duration of time, but a period for the happen-
ing of an event; once in every two years. People
v. Tremain, 9 Hun (N.Y.) 576; People v. Kilbourn,
68 N.Y. 479.

## BIENS

In English law. Property of every de-
scription, except estates of freeho\d and inheri-
tance. Sugd.Vend. 495; Co.Litt. 119b.
In French law. This term includes all kinds
of property, real and personal. Biens are divided
into biens meubles, movable property; and biens
immeubles, immovable property. The distinction
between movable and immovable property is rec-
ognized by the continental jurists, and gives rise,
in the civil as well as in the common law, to many
important distinctions as to rights and remedies.
Story, Confl.Laws, § 13, note 1. Castle v. Castle,
C.C.A.Hawaii, 267 F. 521, 523.
BIGA, or BIGATA. A cart or chariot drawn with
two horses, coupled side to side; but it is said to
be properly a cart with two wheels, sometimes
drawn by one horse; and in the ancient records
it is used for any cart, wain, or wagon. Jacob.

## BIGAMUS

In the civil law. A man who was
twice married; one who at different times and
successively has married two wives. 4 Inst. 88.
One who has two wives living. One who marries
a widow.
Used in ecclesiastical matters as a reason for
denying benefit of the clergy. Termes de la Ley.
BIGAMUS SEU TRIGAMUS, ETC., EST QUI DI-
VERSIS TEMPORIBUS ET SUCCESSIV1 DUAS
SEU TRES UXORES HABUIT. 4 Inst. 88. A big-
amus or trigamus, etc., is one who at different
times and successively has married two or three
wives.

## BIGAMY

The criminal offense of willfully and
knowingly contracting a second marriage (or go-
ing through the form of a second marriage) while
the first marriage, to the knowledge of the of-
fender, is still subsisting and undissolved. Scog-
gins v. State, 32 Ark. 213; People v. Manfredonio,
191 N.Y.S. 748, 117 Misc. 632, 39 N.Y.Cr.R. 41.
The state of a man who has two wives, or of a
woman who has two husbands, living at the same
time. State v. Lindsey, 26 N.M. 526, 194 P. 877.
Farewell v. Commonwealth, 189 S.E. 321, 323, 167
Va. 475.
The offense of having a plurality of wives at the same
time is commonly denominated "polygamy;" but the name
"bigamy" has been more frequently given to it in legal
proceedings. 1 Russ.Crimes, 185.
The use of the word "bigamy" to describe this offense is
well established by long usage, although often criticized as
a corruption of the true meaning of the word. Polygamy
is suggested as the correct term, instead of bigamy, to
designate the offense of having a plurality of wives or hus-
bands at the same time, and has been adopted for that
purpose in the Massachusetts statutes. But as the sub-
stance of the offense is marrying a second time, while
having a lawful husband or wife living, without regard to
the number of marriages that may have taken place, biga-
my seems not an inappropriate term. The objection to
Its use urged by Blackstone (4 Bl.Comm. 163) seems to be
founded not so much upon considerations of the etymology
of the word as upon the propriety of distinguishing the ec-
clesiastical offense termed "bigamy" in the canon law, and
which is defined below, from the offense known as "big-
amy" in the modern criminal law. The same distinction is
carefully made by Lord Coke, (4 Inst. 88.) But, the ec-
clesiastical offense being now obsolete, this reason for sub-
stituting polygamy to denote the crime here defined ceas-
es to have weight. Abbott.
In the canon law, the term denoted the offense
committed by an ecclesiastic who married two
wives successively. It might be committed either
by marrying a second wife after the death of a
first or by marrying a widow.

## BIGOT

An obstinate person, or one that is wed-
ded to an opinion, in matters of religion, etc.

## BILAGINES

By-laws of towns; municipal laws.

## BILAN

A term used in Louisiana, derived from

and traders write a statement of all they owe and
all that is due them; a balance-sheet. See Dauph-
in v. Soulie, 3 Mart. (N.S.) 446.

## BILANCIIS DEFERENDIS

obsolete writ addressed to a corporation for the
carrying of weights to such a haven, there to
weigh the wool anciently licensed for transporta-
tion. Reg.Orig. 270.

## BILATERAL CONTRACT

A term, used original-
ly in the civil law, but now generally adopted, de-
noting a contract in which both the contracting
parties are bound to fulfill obligations reciprocally
towards each other; as a contract of sale, where
one becomes bound to deliver the thing sold, and
the other to pay the price of it. Montpelier Semi-
nary v. Smith, 69 Vt. 382, 38 A. 66. A contract
executory on both sides, National Surety Co. v.
City of Atlanta, 102 S.E. 175, 176, 24 Ga.App. 732,
and one which includes both rights and duties
on each side, Crane Ice Cream Co. v. Terminal
Freezing & Heating Co., 147 Md. 588, 128 A. 280,
282, 39 A.L.R. 1184. One containing mutual prom-
ises between parties; each party being both prom-
isor and promisee. Aden v. Dalton, 341 Mo. 454,
107 S.W.2d 1070, 1073.
"Every convention properly so called consists of a prom-
ise or mutual promises proffered and accepted. Where one
only of the agreeing parties gives a promise, the conven-
tion is said to be 'unilateral.' Wherever mutual promises
are proffered and accepted, there are, in strictness, two
or more conventions. But where the performance of eith-
er of the promises is made to depend on the performance
of the other, the several conventions are commonly deemed
lateral.' " Aust.Jur. § 308.
See, also, Contract.

## BILINE

A word used by Britton in the sense of
"collateral." En line biline, in the collateral line.
Britt, c. 119.

## BILINGUIS

the old books to a jury composed partly of Eng-
lishmen and partly of foreigners, which, by the
English law, an alien party to a suit is, in certain
cases, entitled to; more commonly called a "jury
de medietate linguce." 3 Bl.Comm. 360; 4 Steph.
Comm. 422.

## BILL

A formal declaration, complaint, or state-
ment of particular things in writing.
As a legal term, this word has many meanings
and applications, the more important of which are
enumerated below.
1. A formal written statement of complaint
to a court of justice
In the ancient practice of the court of king's
bench, the usual and orderly method of beginning
an action was by a bill, or original bill, or plaint.
This was a written statement of the plaintiff's
cause of action, like a declaration or complaint,
and always alleged a trespass as the ground of it,
in order to give the court jurisdiction. 3 Bl.Comm.
In Scotch law, every summary application in
writing, by way of petition to the Court of Ses-
sion, is called a "bill." Cent. Dict.
—Bill chamber. In Scotch law. A department of
the court of session in which petitions for sus-
pension, interdict, etc., are entertained. It is
equivalent to sittings in chambers in the English
and American practice. Paters. Comp.
—Bill of privilege. In old English law. A method
of proceeding against attorneys and officers of the
court not liable to arrest. 3 Bl.Comm. 289.
—Bill of proof. In English practice. The name
given, in the mayor's court of London, to a species
of intervention by a third person laying claim to
the subject-matter in dispute between the parties
to a suit.
2. A species of writ
A formal written declaration by a court to its
officers, in the nature of process.
ilar to a capias, issued out of the court of king's
bench in personal actions, directed to the sheriff
of the county of Middlesex, (hence 'the name,)
and commanding him to take the defendant and
have him before the king at Westminster on a
day named, to answer the plaintiff's complaint.
3. A formal written petition
To a superior court for action to be taken in a
cause already determined, or a record or certified
account of the proceedings in such action or some
portion thereof, accompanying such a petition.
—Bill of advocation. In Scotch practice. A bill
by which the judgment of an inferior court is ap-
pealed from, or brought under review of a su-
perior. Bell.
—Bill of certiorari. A bill: the object of which is
to remove a suit in equity from some inferior
court to the court of chancery, or some other su-
perior court of equity, on account of some alleged
incompetency of the inferior court, or some injus-
tice in its proceedings. Story, Eq.P1. (5th Ed.) §
—Bill of evidence. Stenographer's transcript of
testimony heard at trial and may be considered on
appeal as bill of exceptions. Spencer v. Common-
wealth, 250 Ky. 370, 63 S.W.2d 288.
—Bill of exceptions. A formal statement in writ-
ing of the objections or exceptions taken by a
party during the trial of a cause to the decisions,
rulings, or instructions of the trial judge, stating
the objection, with the facts and circumstances on
which it is founded, and, in order to attest its
accuracy, signed and sealed by the judge; the
object being to put the controverted rulings or
decisions upon the record for the information of
the appellate court. Buessel v. U. S., C.C.A.Conn.,
258 Fla. 811, 815.
It is designed to preserve and make a part of the record
proceedings not otherwise of record. Yott v. Yott, 100 N.
E. 902, 903, 257 Iii. 419; It is only that part of the proceed-
ings not embraced in the judgment roll. When the ends of
justice require it, the terms "bill of exceptions" and
"statement of case" are regarded as synonymous; Shaw-
nee Commercial College v. Aydelotte, 38 P.2d 579, 581, 170
Okl. 15.
"Bill of exceptions" and "transcripts of evidence," how-
ever, are clearly distinguishable. The latter may contain
no objection or exception, and nothing other than the evi-
dence introduced on the trial; the former is, strictly
speaking, only a record which points out alleged errors
committed below in relation to evidence as well as other
things. Broadway & Newport Bridge Co. v. Common-
wealth, 173 Ky. 165, 190 S.W. 715, 719.
4. In equity practice
A formal written complaint, in the nature of a
petition, addressed by a suitor in chancery to the
chancellor or to a court of equity or a court having
equitable jurisdiction, showing the names of the
parties, stating the facts which make up th., case
and the complainant's allegations, averring that
the acts disclosed are contrary to equity, and pay-
ing for process and for specific relief, or for such
Sharon, 67 Cal. 185, 7 P. 456.
—Bill for a new trial. A bill in equity in which
the specific relief asked is an injunction against
the execution of a judgment rendered at law, and
a new trial in the action, on account of some fact
which would render it inequitable to enforce the
judgment, but which was not available to the
party on the trial at law, or which he was pre-
vented from presenting by fraud or accident, with-
out concurrent fraud or negligence on his own
part.
—Bill for foreclosure. One which is filed by a
mortgagee against the mortgagor, for the purpose
of having the estate sold, thereby to obtain the
sum mortgaged on the premises, with interest and
costs. 1 Madd.Ch.Pr. 528.
—Bill for fraud. The object and effect of it, even if
the fraud consists of want of notice, are to vacate
the former decree, not to retry the case. Caldwell
v. Huffstutter, 173 Tenn. 225, 116 S.W.2d 1017, 1019.
—Bill in aid of execution. A bill to set aside en-
cumbrances or conveyances therein specified as
fraudulent. Pape v. Pareti, 42 N.E.2d 361, 364, 315
Ill.App. 1 ; Dean v. Torrence, 299 N.W. 793, 796, 299
Mich. 24.
—Bill in nature of a bill of review. A bill in
equity, to obtain a re-examination and reversal of
a decree, filed by one who was not a party to the
original suit, nor bound by the decree.
—Bill in nature of a bill of revivor. Where, on
the abatement of a suit, there is such a transmis-
sion of the interest of the incapacitated party that
the title to it, as well as the person entitled, may
be the subject of litigation in a court of chancery,
the suit cannot be continued by a mere bill of
revivor, but an original bill upon which the title
may be litigated must be filed. This is called a
"bill in the nature of a bill of revivor." It is
founded on privity of estate or title by the act of
the party. And the nature and operation of the
whole act by which the privity is created is open
to controversy. Story, Eq.P1. §§ 378-380; 2 Amer.
& Eng.Enc.Law, 271.
—Bill in nature of a supplemental bill. A bill
filed when new parties, with new interests, arising
from events happening since the suit was com-
menced, are brought before the court; wherein it
differs from a supplemental bill, which is properly
applicable to those cases only where the same
parties or the same interests remain before the
court. Story, Eq.P1. (5th Ed.) § 345 et seq.
—Bill in nature of interpleader. See Bill of Inter-
pleader.
—Bill of conformity. One filed by an executor or
administrator, who finds the affairs of the de-
ceased so much involved that he cannot safely
administer the estate except under the direction of
a court of chancery. This bill is filed against the
their claims adjusted, and procuring a final de-
cree settling the order of payment of the assets.
1 Story, Eq.Jur. § 440.
—Bill of discovery. A proceeding by a party
against an adversary for discovery of facts within
adversary's knowledge, or discovery of documents,
writings, or other things within his possession or
power, to be used either offensively or defensively
in a pending or contemplated action. Dallas Joint
Stock Land Bank v. Rawlins, Tex.Civ.App., 129 S.
W.2d 485, 486; First Nat. Bank v. Dade-Broward
Co., 171 So. 510, 125 Fla. 594.
In aid of action at law is equitable remedy to enable
litigant to obtain, prior to trial, such information as is in
exclusive possession of adverse party and is necessary to
establishment of complainant's case. Yorkshire Worsted
Mills v. National Transit Co., 325 Pa. 427, 190 A. 897, 898.
—Bill of information. Where a suit is instituted
on behalf of the crown or government, or of those
of whom it has the custody by virtue of its pre-
rogative, or whose rights are under its particular
protection, the matter of complaint is offered to
the court by way of information by the attorney
or solicitor general, instead of by petition. Where
a suit immediately concerns the crown or govern-
ment alone, the proceeding is purely by way of
information, but, where it does not do so imme-
diately, a relator is appointed, who is answerable
for costs, etc., and, if he is interested in the mat-
ter in connection with the crown or government,
the proceeding is by information and bill. In-
formations differ from bills in little more than
name and form, and the same rules are sub-
stantially applicable to both. 3 Bl.Comm. 261.
—Bill of interpleader. The name of a bill in equity
to obtain a settlement of a question of right to
money or other property adversely claimed, in
which the party filing the bill has no interest, al-
though it may be in his hands, by compelling such
adverse claimants to litigate the right or title be-
tween themselves, and relieve him from liability
or litigation. Republic Casualty Co. v. Fischmann,
99 N.J.Eq. 758, 134 A. 179, 180.
—Bill of peace. One which is filed when a person
has a right which may be controverted by various
persons, at different times, and by different ac-
tions. Smith v. Cretors, 164 N.W. 338, 340, 181
Iowa 189.
—Bill of review. One which is brought to have
a decree of the court reviewed, corrected, or re-
versed. Dodge v. Northrop, 85 Mich. 243, 48 N.W.
505. It is in the nature of a writ of error. Rubin
v. Midlinsky, 327 Ill. 89, 158 N.E. 395.
It is equitable procedure to procure explanation, altera-
tion, or reversal of final decree by court which rendered it.
People v. Sterling, 357 Ill. 354, 192 N.E. 229, 234.
The object of a "bill of review" and of a bill in nature
of a bill of review in the old chancery practice was to pro-
cure a reversal, modification, or explanation of a decree
in a former suit. Barz v. Sawyer, 159 Iowa 481, 141 N.W.
319, 321.
review, are of three classes; those for error appearing on
the face of the record, those for newly discovered evidence,
and those for fraud impeaching the original transaction.
Moore v. Shook, 276 Ill. 47, 114 N.E. 592, 593. Such bills
are peculiar to courts of equity at common law. Satter-
white v. State, 149 Ark. 147, 231 S.W. 886, 887.
—Bill of revivor. One which is brought to con-
tinue a suit which has abated before its final con-
summation, as, for example, by death, or marriage
of a female plaintiff. Brooks v. Laurent, C.C.A.
Fla., 98 F. 647, 39 C.C.A. 201.
—Bill of revivor and supplement. One which is
a compound of a supplemental bill and bill of
revivor, and not only continues the suit, which
has abated by the death of the plaintiff, or the
like, but supplies any defects in the original bill
arising from subsequent events, so as to entitle
the party to relief on the whole merits of his case.
Westcott. Bowie v. Minter, 2 Ala. 411.
—Bill quia timet. A bill invoking the aid of
equity "because he fears," that is, because the
complainant apprehends an injury to his property
rights or interests, from the fault or neglect of
another. Bisp.Eq. § 568; 2 Story, Eq.Jur. § 826.
Such bills are entertained to guard against possible or
prospective injuries, and to preserve the means by which
existing rights may be protected from future or contingent
violations; differing from injunctions, in that the latter
correct past and present or imminent and certain injuries.
De Carli v. O'Brien, 41 P.2d 411, 416, 150 Or. 35, 97 A.L.R.
—Bill to carry a decree into execution. One which
is filed when, from the neglect of parties or some
other cause, it may become impossible to carry a
decree into execution without the further decree of
the court. Hind, Ch.Pr. 68; Story, Eq.P1. § 42.
—Bill to perpetuate testimony. A bill in equity
filed in order to procure the testimony of witnesses
to be taken as to some matter not at the time be-
fore the courts, but which is likely at some future
time to be in litigation. Story, Eq.P1. (5th Ed.) §
300 et seq.
—Bill to quiet possession and title. Also called a
bill to remove a cloud on title (q. v.), and though
sometimes classed with bills quia timet or for the
cancellation of void instruments, they may be
resorted to in other cases when the complainant's
title is clear and there is a cloud to be removed;
Maguire v. City of Macomb, 293 Ill. 441, 127 N.E.
682, 686.
—Bill to suspend a decree. One brought to avoid
or suspend a decree under special circumstances.
—Bill to take testimony de bene esse. One which
is brought to take the testimony of witnesses to a
fact material to the prosecution of a suit at law
which is actually commenced, where there is good
cause to fear that the testimony may otherwise be
lost before the time of trial. 2 Story, Eq.Jur. §
1813, n.
—Cross-bill. One which is brought by a defendant
in a suit against a plaintiff in or against other de-
fendants in the same suit, or against both, touch-
Story, Eq.P1. § 389; Mitf.Eq.P1. 80.
It is a bill brought by a defendant against a plaintiff, or
other parties in a former bill depending, touching the
matter in question in that bill. It is usually brought eith-
er to obtain a necessary discovery of facts in aid of the de-
fense to the original bill, or to obtain full relief to all par-
ties in reference to the matters of the original bill. It is to
be treated as a mere auxiliary suit. Kidder v. Barr, 35 N.
H. 251; Blythe v. Hinckley, C.C.Cal., 84 F. 234. A species
of pleading, used for the purpose of obtaining a discovery
necessary to the defense, or to obtain some relief founded
on the collateral claims of the party defendant to the orig-
inal suit. Tison v. Tison, 14 Ga. 167. Also, if a bill of ex-
change or promissory note be given in consideration of
another bill or notice, it is called a "cross" or "counter"
bill or note. Landon v. Public Utilities Commission of
Kansas, D.C.Kan., 234 F. 152, 167.
—Supplemental bill. A bill to bring before the
court matters arising after the filing of the orig-
inal bill or not then known to complainant. Puget
Sound Power & Light Co. v. City of Seattle, C.C.
A.Wash., 5 F. (2d) 393. See Bill in nature of a
supplemental bill.
5. In legislation and constitutional law
The word means a draft of an act of the legis-
lature before it becomes a law; a proposed or
projected law. A draft of an act presented to the
legislature, but not enacted. Hubbard v. Lowe, D.
C.N.Y., 226 F. 135, 137. Also a special act passed
by a legislative body in the exercise of a quasi
judicial power. Scudder v. Smith, 331 Pa. 165,
200 A. 601, 604.
The word "bill" may mean the bill as it is first intro-
duced in one of the houses of the legislature, or it may re-
fer to it at any time in any of its stages until finally
passed. People v. Brady, 262 Ill. 578, 105 N.E. 1, 4. An
act is the appropriate term for it, after it has been acted
on by, and passed by, the legislature. Herbring v. Brown,
92 Or. 176, 180 P. 328, 330. Thus, bills of attainder, bills
of pains and penalties, are spoken of.
—Bill of attainder. See Attainder.
—Bill of indemnity. ' In English law. An act of
parliament, passed every session until 1869, but
discontinued in and after that year, as having
been rendered unnecessary by the passing of the
promissory oaths act, 1868, for the relief of those
who have unwittingly or unavoidably neglected to
take the necessary oaths, etc., required for the
purpose of qualifying them to hold their respective
offices. Wharton.
—Bill of pains and penalties. A special act of the
legislature which inflicts a punishment, less than
death, upon persons supposed to be guilty of
treason or felony, without any conviction in the

untrustworthy persons is published by a commer-
cial agency or mercantile association. Quoted and
relied on in Dick v. Northern Pac. Ry. Co., 86
Wash. 211, 150 P. 8, 12, Ann.Cas.1917A, 638, holding
that this word is a generic term having no such
well-defined meaning in law as to make its use in
a pleading a definite charge of any specific mis-
conduct against a person so charged. Cleary v.
Great Northern Ry. Co., 147 Minn. 403, 180 N.W.
545, 546; Masters v. Lee, 39 Neb. 574, 58 N.W.

(blanche firmes,) which were rents paid in silver.
See Black rents.
The extortion of money by threats or overtures
towards criminal prosecution or the destruction of

In common parlance, the term is equivalent to and syn-
onymous with, "extortion,"—the exaction of money, either
for the performance of a duty, the prevention of an injury,
or the exercise of an influence. It supposes the service to
be unlawful, and the payment involuntary. Not infre-
quently it is extorted by threats, or by operating upon the
fears or the credulity, or by promises to conceal, or offers
to expose, the weaknesses, the follies, or the crimes of the
victim. Mitchell v. Sharon, C.C.Cal., 51 F. 424; In re
Mills, 104 Wash. 278, 176 P. 556, 562. "Blackmail" has a
broader meaning than the New York statutory crime of

In English Law
Blasphemy is the offense of speaking matter

feelings of mankind or to excite contempt and
hatred against the church by law established, or
to promote immorality. Sweet.
In American Law
Any oral or written reproach maliciously cast
upon God, His name, attributes, or religion. Com.
v. Kneeland, 20 Pick. (Mass.) 213; Young v. State,
10 Lea (Tenn.) 165; People v. Ruggles, 8 Johns.
(N.Y.) 290, 5 Am.Dec. 335; Updegraph v. Corn.,
11 Serg. & R. (Pa.) 406.
In general, blasphemy may be described as consisting in
speaking evil of the Deity with an impious purpose to
derogate from the divine majesty, and to alienate the
minds of others from the love and reverence of God.
It is purposely using words concerning God calculated
and designed to impair and destroy the reverence, respect,
and confidence due to Him as the intelligent creator, gov-
ernor, and judge of the world. It embraces the idea of
detraction, when used towards the Supreme Being, as
"calumny" usually carries the same idea when applied to
an individual. It is a willful and malicious attempt to
lessen men's reverence of God by denying His existence, or
His attributes as an intelligent creator, governor, and
judge of men, and to prevent their having confidence in
Him as such. Corn. v. Kneeland, 20 Pick. (Mass.) 211, 212.
The use of this word is, in modern law, exclusively con-
fined to sacred subjects; but blasphemia and blasphemare
were anciently used to signify the reviling by one person
of another. Nov. 77, c. 1, § 1; Spelman.

he desires made of it by the court. Bell v. Germain, 12

694, 31 A.L.R. 1441.
It is frequently said, however, to have two distinct mean-
ings : (1) the duty of producing evidence as the case pro-
gresses, and (2) the duty to establish the truth of the
claim by preponderance of the evidence, and though the
former may pass from party to party, the latter rests
throughout upon the party asserting the affirmative of the
issue. Sellers v. Kincaid, 303 Ill. 216, 135 N.E. 429, 433;
Stofer v. Dunham, Mo.App., 208 S.W. 641, 644,
Again "burden of proof" is sometimes used to refer mere-
ly to the rule of practice fixing the order of proof, as dis-
tinguished from the "preponderance of the evidence"
meaning the weight of evidence. Thompson v. Dyson, 120
Kan. 591, 244 P. 867, 868.
