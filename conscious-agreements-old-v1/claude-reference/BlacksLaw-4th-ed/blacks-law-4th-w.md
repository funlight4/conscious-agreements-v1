an option to carry out the transaction or not at pleasure
is not invalid as a "wager." Palmer v. Love, 18 Tenn.
App. 579, 80 S.W.2d 100, 105; but if, under guise of con-
tract of sale, real intent of both parties is merely to specu-
late in rise or fall of prices and property is not to be de-
livered, but at time fixed for delivery one party is to pay
difference between contract price and market price, trans-
action is invalid as "wager." Baucum & Kimball v. Gar-
rett Mercantile Co., 188 La. 728, 178 So. 256, 259, 260.

from the individual's employer or directly with
respect to work for him. Ernst v. Industrial Com-
mission, 246 Wis. 205, 16 N.W.2d 867.
In a limited sense the word "wage" means pay given for
labor usually manual or mechanical at short stated inter-
means that which is pledged or paid for work or other
services; hire; pay. In its legal sense, the word "wages"
means the price paid for labor, reward of labor, specified
sum for a given time of service or a fixed sum for a speci-
fied piece of work. In re Hollingsworth's Estate, 37 Cal.
App.2d 432, 99 P.2d 599, 600, 602.
Maritime Law
The compensation allowed to seamen for their

Political Economy
The reward paid, whether in money or goods, to
human exertion, considered as a factor in the
production of wealth, for its co-operation in the
process.
"Three factors contribute to the production of
commodities,—nature, labor, and capital. Each
must have a share of the product as its reward,
and this share, if it is just, must be proportionate
to the several contributions. The share of the
natural agents is rent; the share of labor, wages;
the share of capital, interest. The clerk receives
a salary; the lawyer and doctor, fees; the manu-
facturer, profits. Salary, fees, and profits are so
many forms of wages for services rendered." De
Laveleye, Pol. Econ.

terials, and in a general sense is a wagon. Stryck-

in order to facilitate his escape, he is technically
said to waive them.
In modern law, to abandon, throw away, re-
nounce, repudiate, or surrender a claim, a privi-
lege, a right, or the opportunity to take advantage
of some defect, irregularity, or wrong. See Brig-
ham Young University v. Industrial Commission
of Utah, 74 Utah 349, 279 P. 889, 893, 65 A.L.R.
A person is said to waive a benefit when he
renounces or disclaims it, and he is said to waive
a tort or injury when he abandons the remedy
which the law gives him for it. Sweet.
In order for one to "waive" a right, he must do it
knowingly and be possessed of the facts. Barnhill v. Ru-
bin, D.C.Tex., 46 F.Supp. 963, 966.

## WAIVE

of something he is entitled to exact or when one
in possession of any right, whether conferred by
law or by contract, with full knowledge of the ma-
terial facts, does or forbears to do something the
doing of which or the failure of forbearance to
do which is inconsistent with the right, or his in-
tention to rely upon it. Estoup Signs v. Frank

consequence from some act or conduct of party against

it is made is necessary to complete it. Coleman Produc-
tion Credit Ass'n v. Mahan, Tex.Civ.App., 168 S.W.2d 903,

times by nonaction. Concrete Engineering Co. v. Grande
Bldg. Co., 230 Mo.App. 443, 86 S.W.2d 595, 608.
Waiver Is distinguished from "estoppel" in that in
"waiver" the essential element is an actual intent to aban-
don or surrender a right, while in "estoppel" such intent
is immaterial; the necessary condition being the deception
to his injury of the other party by the conduct of the one
estopped. Insurance Co. of North America v. Williams, 42
Ariz. 331, 26 P.2d 117, 119. And "estoppel," may result
though party estopped did not intend to lose any existing
rights. Boyce v. Toke Point Oyster Co., 145 Or. 114, 25
P.2d 930.
Insurance Law
Substance of doctrine of "waiver" in insurance
law is that if insurer, with knowledge of facts
which would bar existing primary liability, recog-
nizes such primary liability by treating policy as
in force, it will not thereafter be allowed to plead
such facts to avoid its primary liability. Protec-
tive Life Ins. Co. v. Cole, 230 Ala. 450, 161 So.
818, 819.
Express Waiver
The voluntary, intentional relinquishment of a
known right. Dickert v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., 176
S.C. 476, 180 S.E. 462.
Implied Waiver
A waiver is implied where one party has pur-
sued such a course of conduct with reference to
the other party as to evidence an intention to
waive his rights or the advantage to which he may
be entitled, or where the conduct pursued is incon-
sistent with any other honest intention than an
intention of such waiver, provided that the other
party concerned has been induced by such conduct
to act upon the belief that there has been a waiver,
and has incurred trouble or expense thereby. As-
tritch v. German-American Ins. Co., C.C.A.Pa., 131
F. 20, 65 C.C.A. 251; Roumage v. Insurance Co., 13
N.J.L. 124.
To make out a case of implied "waiver" of a legal right,
there must be a clear, unequivocal and decisive act of the
party showing such purpose, or acts amounting to an es-
toppel on his part. Rosenthal v. New York Life Ins. Co.,
C.C.A.Mo., 99 F.2d 578, 579.
Waiver by Election of Remedies, Doctrine of
Doctrine applies if there exist two or more co-
existing remedies between which there is right
of election, inconsistency as to such available rem-
edies, and actual bringing of action or doing some

inconsistent remedies. Hertz v. Mills, D.C.Md.,
10 F.Supp. 979, 981.

428, 26 N.E.2d 963, 966.
Waiver of Protest
An agreement by the indorser of a note or bill
to be bound in his character of indorser without
the formality of a protest in case of non-payment,
or, in the case of paper which cannot or is not

cessity of a demand and notice. First Nat. Bank v.
Falkenhan, 94 Cal. 141, 29 P. 866; Coddington v.
Davis, 1 N.Y. 190.
Waiver of Tort

Laws of War
This term denotes a branch of public interna-
tional law, and comprises the body of rules and

pitulations, prisoners, and declarations of war and
peace.
Mixed War
A mixed war is one which is made on one side
by public authority, and on the other by mere pri-
vate persons. People v. McLeod, 1 Hill (N.Y.)
377, 415, 37 Am.Dec. 328.
Perfect War
Where whole nation is at war with another
whole nation, but when the hostilities are limited
as respects places, persons, and things, the war
is termed "imperfect war." Bas v. Tingy, 4 Dall.
37, 40, 1 L.Ed. 731.
Private War

by way of defense, but otherwise unknown in
civil society. People v. McLeod, 25 Wend. (N.Y.)

Maviglia, D.C.N.J., 52 F.Supp. 946, 947. It em-
braces every aspect of national defense, including
protection of war materials as well as members
of armed forces from injury and danger. Schuel-
ler v. Drum, D.C.Pa., 51 F.Supp. 383, 387; but
direct interference with liberty and property and
abridgement of constitutional guaranties of free-
dom can be justified under the "war power" only
where the danger to the government is real, im-
pending and imminent. Schueller v. Drum, D.C.
Pa., 51 F.Supp. 383, 387.

Wards of admiralty. Seamen are sometimes
thus designated, because, in view of their general
improvidence and rashness, and though they are
not technically incapable of contracting, their
contracts are treated like those of fiduciaries and
beneficiaries, and if there is any inequality in
terms or any disproportion in the bargain or any
sacrifice of rights of seamen which are not com-
pensated by extraordinary benefits, the judicial
interpretation of the transaction is that the bar-
gain is unjust and that pro tanto, the bargain
ought to be set aside as inequitable. See Garrett

U.S. 239, 87 L.Ed. 239.

accountable for profits. Stim. Gloss. See 2 Bl.

## WARNING

A pointing out of danger. Also a
protest against incurring it. Keller v. Banks, 130
Me. 397, 156 A. 817, 821.
The purpose of a "warning" is to apprise a party of the
existence of danger of which he is not aware to enable him
to protect himself against it, and where the party is aware
of the danger, the warning will serve no useful purpose
and is unnecessary, and there is no duty to warn against
risks which are open and obvious. Wiseman v. Northern
Pac. Ry. Co., 214 Minn. 101, 7 N.W.2d 672, 675.
Under the old practice of the English court of
probate, was a notice given by a registrar of the
principal registry to a person who had entered a
caveat, warning him, within six days after serv-
ice, to enter an appearance to the caveat in the
principal registry, and to set forth his interest,
concluding with a notice that in default of his
doing so the court would proceed to do all such
acts, matters, and things as should be necessary.
By the rules under the judicature acts, a writ of
summons has been substituted for a warning.

970; State v. State Board of Examiners, 74 Mont
1, 238 P. 316, 328.
A "warrant" differs from a "bond" in that a bond is a
"negotiable instrument", whereas a warrant is nonnego-
tiable and is subject at all times to the defenses it would
be were it in the hands of the original payee, which is

fend and insure in peace the tenant, who calls
for warranty, in his seisin; and the tenant in
warranty will have an exchange in proportion to
its value.

WARRANTOR POTEST EXCIPERE QUOD
QUERENS NON TENET TERRAM DE QUA

and the eviction of the grantee by paramount
title, the grantor was bound to recompense him
with other lands of equal value. Co.Litt. 365a.
See "Covenant."
Sales of Personal Property
A statement or representation made by the sell-
er of goods, contemporaneously with and as a part
of the contract of sale, though collateral to the
express object of it, having reference to the char-
acter, quality, or title of the goods, by which he
promises or undertakes that certain facts are or
shall be as he then represents them. Schley v.
Zalis, 172 Md. 336, 191 A. 563, 564; Great Atlantic
& Pacific Tea Co. v. Walker, Tex.Civ.App., 104 S.
W.2d 627, 632. A promise or agreement by seller
that article sold has certain qualities or that seller
has good title thereto. Chanin v. Chevrolet Motor
Co., D.C.Ill., 15 F.Supp. 57, 58. A statement of
fact respecting the quality or character of goods
sold, made by the seller to induce the sale, and
relied on by the buyer. Hercules Powder Co. v.
Rich, C.C.A.Ark., 3 F.2d 12, 14; Van Horn v.
Stautz, 297 Ill. 530, 131 N.E. 153, 154.
"Warranty" in sale of personalty ordinarily applies only
between seller and immediate buyer, and does not give
such buyer right to sue original seller. Timberland Lum-
ber Co. v. Climax Mfg. Co., C.C.A.Pa., 61 F.2d 391, 392.
Contracts
An undertaking or stipulation, in writing, or
verbally, that a certain fact in relation to the
subject of a contract is or shall be as it is stated or
promised to be. United Iron Works Co. v. Henry-
etta Coal & Mining Co., 62 Okl. 99, 162 P. 209, 210;
Hurley-Mason Co. v. Stebbins, Walker & Spinning,
79 Wash. 366, 140 P. 381, 384, L.R.A.1915B, 1131,
Ann.Cas.1916A, 948. An express or implied state-
ment of something undertaken as part of contract
but collateral to its object. Pauls Valley Milling
Co. v. Gabbert, 182 Okl. 500, 78 P.2d 685, 686.
A warranty differs from a representation in that a war-
ranty must always be given contemporaneously with, and
as part of, the contract; whereas a representation precedes
and induces to the contract. And, while that is their
difference in nature, their difference in consequence or ef-
fect is this: that, upon breach of warranty, (or false war-
ranty,) the contract remains binding, and damages only
are recoverable for the breach; whereas, upon a false rep-
resentation, the defrauded party may elect to avoid the
contract, and recover the entire price paid. Brown. And
see Griswold v. Morrison, 53 Cal.App. 93, 200 P. 62, 65.
The same transaction cannot be characterized as a war-
ranty and a fraud at the same time. A warranty rests
upon contract, while fraud, or fraudulent representations
have no element of contract in them, but are essentially
a tort. When judges or law-writers speak of a fraudulent
warranty, the language is neither accurate nor perspicu-
ous. If there is a breach of warranty, it cannot be said
that the warranty was fraudulent, with any more propriety
than any other contract can be said to have been fraud-
ulent, because there has been a breach of it. On the other
hand, to speak of a false representation as a contract or
warranty, or as tending to prove a contract or warranty,
is a perversion of language and of correct ideas. Rose v.
Hurley, 39 Ind. 81; Boysen v. Petersen, 203 Iowa 1073, 211
N.W. 894, 895.
Insurance
A "warranty" in the law of insurance consists
of a statement by insured upon the literal truth
of which the validity of the contract depends.
Braddock, by Smith, v. Pacific Woodmen Life
Ass'n, 89 Utah 75, 54 P.2d 1189, 1192. Statement,
made in insurance contract by insured, which is
susceptible of no construction other than that par-
ties mutually intended that policy should not be
binding, unless such statement be literally true.
Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Wood, Tex.
Civ.App., 79 S.W.2d 665, 668.
It is in the nature of a condition precedent and must
appear on face of policy; or, if on another part of it, or
on a paper physically attached to it, it must appear that
the statements were intended to form part of policy; or,
if on another paper, they must be so referred to in policy
as clearly to indicate that the parties intended them to
form a part of it, but it is not necessary that the state-
ments in an application be set forth in the policy. City
Bank & Trust Co. v. Commercial Casualty Co., La.App.,
176 So. 27.
Warranty may be either "affirmative" or "promissory."
The former affirms the existence of a fact at the time the
policy is entered into, while the latter requires that some-
thing be done or not done after the policy has taken effect.
Sentinel Life Ins. Co. v. Blackmer, C.C.A.Colo., 77 F.2d
347, 350.
General
Affirmative warranty. In the law of insurance,
warranties may be either affirmative or promis-
sory. Affirmative warranties may be either ex-
press or implied, but they usually consist of posi-
tive representations in the policy of the existence
of some fact or state of things at the time, or pre-
vious to the time, of the making of the policy;
they are, in general, conditions precedent, and if
untrue, whether material to the risk or not, the
policy does not attach, as it is not the contract of
the insurer. Maupin v. Insurance Co., 53 W.Va.
557, 45 S.E. 1003; Orient Ins. Co. v. Van Zandt-
Bruce Drug Co., 50 Okl. 558, 151 P. 323, 324. See,
also, Insurance.
Collateral warranty. Existed when the heir's ti-
tle was not derived from the warranting ancestor,
and yet it barred the heir from claiming the land
by any collateral title, upon the presumption that
he might thereafter have assets by descent from
or through the ancestor; and it imposed upon
him the obligation of giving the warrantee other
lands in case of eviction, provided he had assets.
2 B1.Com. 301.
Continuing warranty. One which applies to the
whole period during which the contract is in force;
e. g., an undertaking in a charter-party that a
vessel shall continue to be of the same class that
she was at the time the charter-party was made.
Covenant of warranty. See Covenant.
Executory warranties. See Executory Warran-
ties.
Express warranty. In contracts and sales, one
created by the apt and explicit statements of the
seller or person to be bound. Borrekins v. Bevan,
3 Rawle (Pa.) 36, 23 Am.Dec. 85; White v. Stelloh,
74 Wis. 435, 43 N.W. 99; Hausken v. Hodson-Fee-
naughty Co., 109 Wash. 606, 187 P. 319, 321. In
the law of insurance, an agreement expressed in
a policy, whereby the assured stipulates that cer-
tain facts relating to the risk are or shall be true,
or certain acts relating to the same subject have
been or shall be done. 1 Phil.Ins. (4th Ed.) p.
425; Petit v. German Ins. Co., C.C.W.Va., 98 F.
802; Insurance Co. v. Morgan, 90 Va. 290, 18 S.E.
General warranty. The name of a covenant of
warranty inserted in deeds, by which the grantor
binds himself, his heirs, etc., to "warrant and for-
ever defend" to the grantee, his heirs, etc., the
title thereby conveyed, against the lawful claims
of all persons whatsoever. Where the warranty
is only against the claims of persons claiming "by,
through, or under" the grantor or his heirs, it is
called a "special warranty."
Implied warranty. When the law derives it by
implication or inference from the nature of the
transaction or the relative situation or circum-
stances of the parties. Great Atlantic & Pacific
Tea Co. v. Walker, Tex.Civ.App., 104 S.W.2d 627,

of warranty which existed when the heir derived
title to the land warranted either from or through

actions, and arising from the obligation which one
has contracted to pay the whole or part of a debt
due by another to a third person. Flanders v.

Promissory warranty. In the law of insurance,
a warranty which requires the performance or
omission of certain things or the existence of cer-

of all persons whatsoever, it is called a "general"
warranty.

any willful or negligent acts. Camden Trust Co.
v. Handle, 130 N.J.Eq. 125, 21 A.2d 354, 358.
The early English doctrine was to the effect that any-
thing which changed the character or nature of the land,
notwithstanding the fact that it was an improvement
thereto, constituted "waste." Whitehead v. Whitehead,
Del.Orph., 181 A. 684, 685.
The primary distinction between "waste" and "trespass"
is that in waste the injury is done by one rightfully in
possession. Camden Trust Co. v. Handle, 132 N.J.Eq. 97,
26 A.2d 865, 867, 869.
Old English Criminal Law
A prerogative or liberty, on the part of the

gardens, plowing their meadows, and cutting
down their woods. 4 Bl.Comm. 385.
General
Commissive waste. Active or positive waste;
waste done by acts of spoliation or destruction,
rather than by mere neglect; the same as volun-
tary waste. See infra.
Double waste. See Double.
Equitable waste. Injury to a reversion or re-
mainder in real estate, which is not recognized by
the courts of law as waste, but which equity will

planted for ornament, or for shelter of premises.
Wharton.
Impeachment of waste. Liability for waste com-
mitted, or a demand or suit for compensation

Nul waste. "No waste." The name of a plea in
an action of waste, denying the commission of
waste, and forming the general issue.

tion or carrying away of something attached to
the freehold, and "permissive waste" is the failure
to take reasonable care of the premises. Fisher's
Ex'r v. Haney, 180 Ky. 257, 202 S.W. 495, 496. Vol-
untary or commissive waste consists of injury to
the demised premises or some part thereof, when
occasioned by some deliberate or voluntary act,
as, for instance, the pulling down of a house or
removal of floors, windows, doors, furnaces,
shelves, or other things affixed to and forming

## WATER

As designating a commodity or a sub-
ject of ownership, this term has the same mean-
ing in law as in common speech; but in another
sense, and especially in the plural, it may desig-
nate a body of water, such as a river, a lake, or an
ocean, or an aggregate of such bodies of water, as
in the phrases "foreign waters," "waters of the
United States," and the like.
Water is neither land nor tenement nor susceptible of
absolute ownership. It is a movable thing and must of
necessity continue common by the law of nature. It ad-
mits only of a transient usufructuary property, and if it
escapes for a moment, the right to it is gone forever, the
qualified owner having no legal power of reclamation. It
is not capable of being sued for by the name of "water,"
nor by a calculation of its cubical or superficial measure;
but the suit must be brought for the land which lies at the
bottom covered with water. As water is not land, neither
is it a tenement, because it is not of a permanent nature,
nor the subject of absolute property. It is not in any pos-
sible sense real estate, and hence is not embraced in a
covenant of general warranty. Mitchell v. Warner, 5
Conn. 518.
Coast Waters
See that title.
Developed Water
Water which is brought to the surface and made
available for use by the party claiming the water.
Mountain Lake Mining Co. v. Midway Irr. Co., 47
Utah 346, 149 P. 929, 933.
Flood Waters
Waters which escape from a water course in
great volume and flow over adjoining lands in no
regular channel. The fact that such errant waters
make for themselves a temporary channel or fol-
low some natural channel, gully, or depression
does not affect their character as "flood waters"
or give to the course which they follow the char-
acter of a natural "water course." Mogle v. Moore,
Cal.App., 96 P.2d 147, 150, 151; Everett v. Davis,
Cal.App., 107 P.2d 650, 654, 655.
Foreign Waters

subject to another jurisdiction, as distinguished
from "domestic" waters. The Pilot, 1 C.C.A. 523,
50 F. 437.
Inland Waters
See Inland.
Navigable Waters
See Navigable.
Percolating Waters
Those which pass through the ground beneath
the surface of the earth without any definite chan-
nel, and do not form a part of the body or flow,
surface or subterranean, of any water-course.
They may be either rain waters which are slowly
infiltrating through the soil or waters seeping
through the banks or the bed of a stream, and
which have so far left the bed and the other
waters as to have lost their character as a part of
the flow of that stream. Vineland Irr. Dist. v.
Azusa Irr. Co., 126 Cal. 486, 58 P. 1057, 46 L.R.A.
820; Los Angeles v. Pomeroy, 124 Cal. 597, 57

Private Waters
Non-navigable streams, or bodies of water not
open to the resort and use of the general public,
but entirely owned and controlled by one or more
individuals. Piazzek v. Drainage Dist. No. 1 of
Jefferson County, 119 Kan. 119, 237 P. 1059, 1060.
Public Waters
Such as are adapted for the purposes of naviga-
tion, or those to which the general public have a
right of access, as distinguished from artificial
lakes, ponds, and other bodies of water privately
owned, or similar natural bodies of water owned
exclusively by one or more persons. See Lam-
prey v. Metcalf, 52 Minn. 181, 53 N.W. 1139, 18
L.R.A. 670, 38 Am.St.Rep. 541; State v. Theriault,
70 Vt. 617, 41 A. 1030, 43 L.R.A. 290, 67 Am.St.
Rep. 648.
Waters which lie wholly beneath the surface of
the ground, and which either ooze and seep
through the subsurface strata without pursuing
any defined course or channel, (percolating wa-
ters,) or flow in a permanent and regular but in-
visible course, or lie under the earth in a more or
less immovable body, as a subterranean lake.
Surface Waters
As distinguished from the waters of a natural
stream, lake, or pond, surface waters are such as
diffuse themselves over the surface of the ground,
following no defined course or channel, and not
gathering into or forming any more definite body
of water than a mere bog or marsh. They gen-
erally originate in rains and melting snows, but
the flood waters of a river may also be considered
as surface waters if they become separated from
the main current, or leave it never to return, and
spread out over lower ground. See Schaefer v.
Marthaler, 34 Minn. 487, 26 N.W. 726, 57 Am.Rep.
40; Crawford v. Rambo, 44 Ohio St. 279, 7 N.E.
429; San Gabriel Valley Country Club v. Los An-
geles County, 182 Cal. 392, 188 P. 554, 556, 9 A.L.R.
1200; Thompson v. New Haven Water Co., 86
Conn. 597, 86 A. 585, 588, 45 L.R.A.,N.S., 457.
Water derived from rains and melting snows that is dif-
fused over surface of the ground, and it continues to be
such and may be impounded by the owner of the land
until it reaches some well-defined channel in which it is
accustomed to, and does, flow with other waters, or until
it reaches some permanent lake or pond, whereupon it
ceases to be "surface water" and becomes a "water
course" or a "lake" or "pond," as the case may be. State
v. Hiber, 48 Wyo. 172, 44 P.2d 1005, 1008, 1011.
Surplus Water
Water running off from ground which has been
irrigated; water not consumed by the process of
irrigation; water which the land irrigated will not
take up. Wedgworth v. Wedgworth, 20 Ariz. 518,
181 P. 952, 954.

Water Front
Land or land with buildings fronting on a body
opf water. City of Long Beach v. Lisenby, 175
Cal. 575, 166 P. 333, 335.
Water Power
The water power to which a riparian owner is
entitled consists of the fall in the stream when in
its natural state, as it passes through his land, or
along the boundary of it; or, in other words, it
consists of the difference of level between the sur-
face where the stream first touches his land, and
the surface where it leaves it. McCalmont v.
Whitaker, 3 Rawle (Pa.) 90, 23 Am.Dec. 102.
The use of water for power according to common under-
standing means its application to a water wheel to the end
that its energy under the specified head and fall may be
utilized and converted into available force. Holyoke Wa-
ter Power Co. v. American Writing Paper Co., D.C.Mass.,
17 F.Supp. 895, 898.
A legal right, in the nature of a corporeal
hereditament, to use the water of a natural stream
or water furnished through a ditch or canal, for
general or specific purposes, such as irrigation,
mining, power, or domestic use, either to its full
capacity or to a measured extent or during a
defined portion of the time. See Hill v. Newman,
5 Cal. 445, 63 Am.Dec. 140; Murphy v. Kerr, D.C.
N.M., 296 F. 536, 541; City of Los Angeles v. City
of Glendale, Cal.App., 132 P.2d 574, 584. A usu-
fruct in a stream consisting in the right to have
the water flow so that some portion of it may be
reduced to possession and be made private prop-
erty of individual, and it is therefore the right to
divert water from natural stream by artificial
means and apply the same to beneficial use. Ron-
zio v. Denver & R. G. W. R. Co., C.C.A.Utah, 116
F.2d 604, 605. It includes right to change the place
of diversion, storage, or use of water if rights of
other water users will not be injured. Lindsey v.
McClure, C.C.A.N.M., 136 F.2d 65, 70.
It was also said to be real property which may be sold
and transferred separately from land on which it has been
used. Federal Land Bank of Spokane v. Union Cent. Life
Ins. Co., 54 Idaho 161, 29 P.2d 1009, 1011.

## WATER COURSE

A running stream of water;
a natural stream fed from permanent or natural
sources, including rivers, creeks, runs, and rivu-
lets. There must be a stream, usually flowing in
a particular direction, though it need not flow con-
tinuously. It may sometimes be dry. It must flow
in a definite channel, having a bed or banks, and
usually discharges itself into some other stream
or body of water. It must be something more
than a mere surface drainage over the entire face
of the tract of land, occasioned by unusual freshets
or other extraordinary causes. Leader v. Mat-
thews, 192 Ark. 1049, 95 S.W.2d 1138, 1139; Los
Angeles v. Pomeroy, 124 Cal. 597, 57 P. 587; Walt
v. Phillips, 166 Ark. 163, 266 S.W. 71, 73; Turner
v. Big Lake Oil Co., Tex.Civ.App., 62 S.W.2d 491,
A "water course," in the legal meaning of the word,
does not consist merely of the stream as it flows within
the banks which form its channel in ordinary stages of
water, but the stream still retains its character as a water
course when, in times of ordinary high water, the stream
extending beyond its own banks, is accustomed to flow
down over the adjacent lowlands in a broader but still
definable stream. Atchison, T. & S. F. Ry. Co, v. Hadley,
168 Okl. 588, 35 P.2d 463, 466.
Water flowing underground in a known and well defined
channel is not "percolating water", but constitutes a "wa-
ter course", and is governed by law applicable to "surface
streams", rather than by law applicable to percolating
waters. Bull v. Siegrist, 169 Or. 180, 126 P.2d 832, 834.
Natural Water Course
A natural stream flowing in a defined bed or
channel; one formed by the natural flow of the
water, as determined by the general superficies or
conformation of the surrounding country, as dis-
tinguished from an "artificial" water course,
formed by the work of man, such as a ditch or
canal. See Barkley v. Wilcox, 86 N.Y. 140, 40 Am.
Rep. 519; Hawley v. Sheldon, 64 Vt. 491, 24 Atl.

Wis. 364, 191 N.W. 499, 500.

## WATER-MARK

A mark indicating the highest
point to which water rises, or the lowest point to
which it sinks.
High-Water Mark
This term is properly applicable to tidal waters,
and designates the line on the shore reached by
the water at the high or flood tide. With reference
to the waters of artificial ponds or lakes, created
by dams in unnavigable streams, it denotes the
highest point on the shores to which the dams can

A passage, path, road, or street. In a tech-
nical sense, a right of passage over land.
"Ways are appendant or appurtenant" when they are
incident to an estate, one terminus being on the land of
the party claiming it; while "way in gross" must be a
personal right, not assignable nor inheritable. Safety
Building & Loan Co. v. Lyles, 131 S.C. 540, 128 S.E. 724,
725. See "Easement."
Private Way
A right which a person has of passing over the
land of another. Jones v. Venable, 120 Ga. 1, 47
S.E. 549; Kister v. Reeser, 98 Pa. 1, 42 Am.Rep.
608; Kripp v. Curtis, 71 Cal. 62, 11 P. 879. In an-
other sense (chiefly in New England) a private
way is one laid out by the local public authorities
for the accommodation of individuals and wholly
or chiefly at their expense, but not restricted to
,
their exclusive use, being subject, like highways,
to the public easement of passage. Clark v. Bos-
ton, C. & M. R. Co., 24 N.H. 118; Butchers', etc.,
Ass'n v. Boston, 139 Mass. 290, 30 N.E. 94.
Right of Way
See that title.
Way of Necessity
Exists where land granted is completely en-
vironed by land of the grantor, or partially by his
land and the land of strangers. The law implies
from these facts that a private right of way over
the grantor's land was granted to the grantee as
appurtenant to the estate. Gwinn v. Gwinn, 77
W.Va. 281, 87 S.E. 371, 373; Violet v. Martin, 62
Mont. 335, 205 P. 221, 223. It is not merely one
of convenience, and never exists where person may
reach highway over his own land. Backhausen
v. Mayer, 204 Wis. 286, 234 N.W. 904, 905, 74 A.L.
R. 1245. And it cannot legally exist where neither
the party claiming the way nor owner of land
over which it is claimed, nor anyone under whom
either of them claim, was ever seized of both tracts
of land at same time. Bowles v. Chapman, 180
Tenn. 232, 175 S.W.2d 313, 314. It is not based
on continuous adverse user, but arises by impli-
cation of law from necessities of case, and ceases
when necessity therefor ceases. Waubun Beach
Ass'n v. Wilson, 274 Mich. 598, 265 N.W. 474, 478,
103 A.L.R. 983.
The extent of a "way of necessity" is a way such as is
required for complete and beneficial use of land to which
the way is impliedly attached. New York Cent. R. Co. v.
Yarian, Ind., 219 Ind. 477, 39 N.E.2d 604, 606, 139 A.L.R.

198 A. 687, 688.

"committee on ways and means" is a committee
appointed to inquire into and consider the meth-

pose means for providing the funds needed by the

## WAYWARDENS

The English highway acts pro-
vide that in every parish forming part of a high-
way district there shall annually be elected one
or more waywardens. The waywardens so elect-
ed, and the justices for the county residing with-
in the district, form the highway board for the
district. Each waywarden also represents his par-
ish in regard to the levying of the highway rates,
and in questions arising concerning the liability of

more or less labor, and which are objects of fre-
quent barter and sale, is what we usually call

WEIGHT OF EVIDENCE. The balance of pre-
ponderance of evidence; the inclination of the
greater amount of credible evidence, offered in
a trial, to support one side of the issue rather than
the other.
The "weight" or "preponderance of proof" is a phrase
constantly used, the meaning of which is well understood
and easily defined. It indicates clearly to the jury that
the party having the burden of proof will be entitled to
their verdict, if, on weighing the evidence in their minds,
they shall find the greater amount of credible evidence sus-
tains the issue which is to be established before them.
Haskins v. Haskins, 9 Gray, Mass., 393. Weight is not a
question of mathematics, but depends on its effect in in-
ducing belief. It often happens that an uncorroborated
witness may tell a story so natural and reasonable, and in
manner so sincere and honest, as to command belief,
though contradicted by others. Braunschweiger v. Waits,
179 Pa. 47, 36 A. 155, 156. "Weight of proof" means
greater amount of credible evidence and is synonymous
with "preponderance of proof." Haskins v. Haskins, 75

v. Tucker, 37 Ark. 580, 588. See, also, Preponderance.

WESTMINSTER THE FIRST, STATUTE OF.
The statute 3 Edw. I., A. D. 1275. This statute,
which deserves the name of a code rather than an
act, is divided into fifty-one chapters. Without
extending the exemption of churchmen from civil
jurisdiction, it protects the property of the church
from the violence and spoliation of the king and
the nobles, provides for freedom of popular elec-
tions, because sheriffs, coroners, and conservators
of the peace were still chosen by the freeholders
in the county court, and attempts had been made
to influence the election of knights of the shire,
from the time when they were instituted. It con-
tains a declaration to enforce the enactment of
Magna Charta against excessive fines, which
might operate as perpetual imprisonment; enu-
merates and corrects the abuses of tenures, partic-
ularly as to marriage of wards; regulates the
levying of tolls, which were imposed arbitrarily
by the barons and by cities and boroughs; cor-
rects and restrains the powers of the king's es-
cheator and other officers; amends the criminal
to which it has been lately restored, as a most
grievous, but not capital, offense; and embraces
the subject of procedure in civil and criminal
matters, introducing many regulations to render
it cheap, simple, and expeditious. 1 Camp. Lives

ple v. Russell, 251 Mass. 231, 146 N.E. 679, 680, 49
A.L.R. 1, and the word "will" as so used is man-
datory, comprehensive, and dispositive in nature,
Mastellar v. Atkinson, 94 Kan. 279, 146 P. 367, 368,
Ann.Cas.1917B, 502.
Law of Wills
The legal expression or declaration of a person's
mind or wishes as to the disposition of his prop-
erty, to be performed or take effect after his death.
Swinb. Wills, § 2; Thomas v. House, 145 Va. 742,
134 S.E. 673, 674; In re McCune's Estate, 265 Pa.
523, 109 A. 156, 157; Krause v. Krause, 113 Neb. 22,
201 N.W. 670, 673. A revocable instrument by
which a person makes disposition of his property
to take effect after his death. Howard's Ex'r v.
Dempster, 246 Ky. 153, 54 S.W.2d 660, 661. Any
instrument whereby a person makes a disposition
of his property to take effect after his death.
Todd v. Williams' Adm'x, 264 Ky. 788, 95 S.W.2d
593, 596. A written instrument executed with
the formalities of law, whereby a person makes
a disposition of his property to take effect after
his death. Tax Commission of Ohio v. Parker,
117 Ohio St. 215, 158 N.E. 89, 90.
To constitute "will," intention must appear that writer
by document itself intended to make disposition of prop-
erty effective only after death. In re Button's. Estate, 209
Cal. 325, 287 P. 964, 967.
A "will" is not a sheet of paper, nor a number of sheets
or pages, but consists of the words written thereon. In re
Golden's Will, 165 Misc. 205, 300 N.Y.S. 737, 738. And the
form of an instrument is of little consequence in determin-
ing whether it is a will, but if it is executed with formali-
ties required by statute, and if it is to operate only after
death of maker, it is a "will". In re Fowle's Estate, 292
Mich. 500, 290 N.W. 883, 885.
Instruments conveying a present interest are deeds, and
not wills, Jung v. Petermann, Tex.Civ.App., 194 S.W. 202,
205; Moss v. Hodges, 294 Ky. 677, 172 S.W.2d 584, 585;
for wills pass no interest until after the death of the mak-
er; Willis v. Fiveash, Tex.Civ.App., 297 S.W. 509, 510;
Sims v. Brown, 252 Mo. 58, 158 S.W. 624, 627. An instru-
ment, although in form of a bill or note, which is intended
to have no operation until death of maker, is not "con-
tractual" but is of the nature of a "will." In re Murphy's
Estate, 193 Wash. 400, 75 P.2d 916, 924.
"Codicil" to will is distinguished from new "will," in
that the latter revokes the first in its entirety unless other-
wise provided therein. In re Bissell's Estate, 302 Pa.
27, 153 A. 692, 694.
The distinction between a "will" and a "power of ap-
pointment" Is that a will concerns the estate of the testa-
tor, while an appointment under a power concerns that
of the donor of the power. Thompson v. Pew, 214 Mass.
520, 102 N.E. 122.
The difference between a will and a trust is that a will
operates from the moment of death, while a trust operates
in pra?senti to a certain extent. Allen v. Hendrick, 104
Or. 202, 206 P. 733, 740.
A gift inter vivos is distinguishable from a will in that
such a gift may be made by parol and, upon the acceptance
of the gift by the donee, the gift is irrevocable by the don-
or, while ordinarily a will is required to be in writing, and
usually is made in view of the fact of death, and is inef-
fective until the death of the testator and the admission
of the will to probate. York v. Trigg, 87 Old. 214, 209 P.
417, 423.
The term will, as an expression of the final disposition of
one's property, is confined to the English laws and those
countries which derive their jurisprudence from that
source. The term testamentum, or testament, is exclusive-
ly used in the Roman civil law and by the continental
writers upon that subject.
A will, when it operates upon personal property, is some-
times called a "testament," and when upon real estate, a
"devise;" but the more general and the more popular de-
nomination of the instrument embracing equally real and
personal estate is that of "last will and testament." 4
Kent, Comm. 501; In re Kiltz's Will, 125 Misc.Rep. 475,
211 N.Y.S. 450, 461.
Criminal Law
The power of the mind which directs the action
of a man.
Scotch Practice
That part or clause of a process which contains
the mandate or command to the officer. Bell.
General
Ambulatory will. A changeable will (ambula-
toria voluntas), the phrase merely denoting the
power which a testator possesses of altering his
will during his life-time. See Hattersley v. Bissett,
50 N.J.Eq. 577, 25 A. 332.
Conditional will. A conditional disposition is
one which depends upon the occurrence of some
uncertain event, by which it is either to take effect
or to be defeated. Rogers v. Mosier, 121 Okl. 213,
245 P. 36, 38. If the happening of an event named
in a will is the reason for making the will, it is
"unconditional"; but, if the testator intends to
dispose of his property in case the event happens,
the will is "conditional." Ferguson v. Ferguson,
Tex.Civ.App., 288 S.W. 833, 835.
Conjoint will. See Joint Will, infra.
Counter wills. Another name for "double,"
"mutual," or "reciprocal" wills. Wright v. Wright,
215 Ky. 394, 285 S.W. 188, 189.
Double will. Called also a "counter," "mutual,"
or "reciprocal" will. Wright v. Wright, 215 Ky.
394, 285 S.W. 188, 189. See Double.
Estate at will. This estate entitles the grantee
or lessee to the possession of land during the
pleasure of both the grantor and himself, yet it
creates no sure or durable right, and is bounded
by no definite limits as to duration. It must be at
the reciprocal will of both parties, (for, if it be at
the will of the lessor only, it is a lease for life,)
and the dissent of either determines it. Whar-
ton.
Holographic will. One that is entirely written,
dated, and signed by the hand of the testator him-
self. In re Hail's Estate, 106 Okl. 124, 235 P. 916,
917; In re Cole's Will, 171 N.C. 74, 87 S.E. 962;
Civ.Code La. art. 1588. Sometimes spelled "olo-
graphic." Succession of Cunningham, 142 La.
701, 77 So. 506, 510. The statutes in the different
states differ to some extent, but agree substan-
tially with the English statute of Charles II.
Compliance with the precise terms of the statu-
tory definition or requirements is commonly in-
sisted upon with the utmost meticulosity. In re
Thorn's Estate, 183 Cal. 512, 192 P. 19, 20.
Joint and mutual will. One executed jointly by
two persons with reciprocal provisions, which
shows on its face that the devises are made one in
consideration of the other. Wright v. Wright, 215
Ky. 394, 285 S.W. 188, 189; Bright v. Cox, 147 Ga.
474, 94 S.E. 572, 573.
Joint will. One where the same instrument is
made the will of two or more persons and is
jointly signed by them. Such wills are usually
executed to make testamentary disposition of joint
property. Bright v. Cox, 147 Ga. 474, 94 S.E. 572,
573; Campbell v. Dunkelberger, 172 Iowa 385,
153 N.W. 56, 58. A joint or conjoint will is a
testamentary instrument executed by two or more
persons, in pursuance of a common intention, for
the purpose of disposing of their several inter-
ests in property owned by them in common, or
of their separate property treated as a common
fund, to a third person or persons. Ginn v. Ed-
mundson, 173 N.C. 85, 91 S.E. 696.
Mutual will. One in which two or more persons
make mutual or reciprocal provisions in favor of
each other. Ginn v. Edmundson, 173 N.C. 85, 91
S.E. 696. "Mutual wills" are the separate wills
of two persons which are reciprocal in their pro-
visions, and such a will may be both joint and
mutual. Campbell v. Dunkelberger, 172 Iowa 385,
153 N.W. 56, 58; Carle v. Miles, 89 Kan. 540, 132
P. 146, Ann.Cas.1915A, 363; Bright v. Cox, 147
Ga. 474, 94 S.E. 572, 573. Sometimes called a "re-
ciprocal," "double," or "counter" will. Wright v.
Wright, 215 Ky. 394, 285 S.W. 188, 189.
Mystic will. See Testament.
Non-intervention will. In some jurisdictions,
one authorizing the executor to act without bond
and to manage, control, and settle the estate
without the intervention of any court whatsoever.
In re MacDonald's Estate, 29 Wash. 422, 428, 69
P. 1111.
Nuncupative will. See that title.
Reciprocal will. One in which two or more per-
sons make mutual or reciprocal provisions in favor
of each other. Ginn v. Edmundson, 173 N.C. 85, 91
S.E. 696. Also known as a "mutual," "double," or
"counter" will. Wright v. Wright, 215 Ky. 394, 285
S.W. 188, 189.
Self-proved wills. A will which eliminates some
of the formalities of proof by execution in com-
pliance with statute. It is made self-proved by af-
fidavit of attesting witnesses in the form prescrib-
ed by statute. Most statutes provide that, unless
contested, such a will may be admitted to probate
without testimony of subscribing witnesses.
Statute of wills. See Wills Act, infra.
Unofficious will. In the civil law, testamentum
inofficium. One made in disregard of natural
obligations as to inheritance. Stein v. Wilzinski, 4
Redf.Sur. (N.Y.) 450; 2 Bla.Comm. 502; Hadley,
Rom.L. 317. It has no place in the common law;
1 Fost. & F. 578.

## WILL CONTEST

A proceeding sui generis, a
suit in rem, having for its purpose determination
50, 51. Any kind of litigated controversy concern-
ing the eligibility of an instrument to probate as
distinguished from validity of the contents of
the will. In re Hesse's Estate, 62 Ariz. 273, 157
P.2d 347, 349,

## WILLA

In Hindu law. The relation between a
master or patron and his freedman, and the rela-
tion between two persons who had made a recipro-
cal testamentary contract. Wharton.

## WILLFUL

Proceeding from a conscious motion
of the will; voluntary. Nashville, C. & St. L. Ry.
Co. v. Commonwealth, 160 Ky. 50, 169 S.W. 511,
Intractable; having a headstrong disposition to
act by the rule of contradiction. Bersch v. Morris
& Co., 106 Kan. 800, 189 P. 934, 935, 9 A.L.R. 1374.

131 Va. 762, 109 S.E. 427, 428; Jones v. State, 7
Ala.App. 180, 62 So. 306, 307.
Intending the result which actually comes to
pass; designed; intentional; not accidental or
involuntary. Garrett v. Commonwealth, 215 Ky.
484, 285 S.W. 203, 204; State v. Muzzy, 87 Vt. 267,
88 A. 895, 896; Roseville Trust Co. v. American
Surety Co. of New York, 91 N.J.Law, 588, 103 A.
182; State v. Lehman, 131 Minn. 427, 155 N.W.
399, Ann.Cas.1917D, 615; United States v. Illinois
Cent. R. Co., La., 58 S.Ct. 533, 535, 303 U.S. 239, 82
L.Ed. 773.
The word "wilful" is a word of many meanings depend-
ing on the context in which it is used. Zimberg v. United
States, C.C.A.Mass., 142 F.2d 132, 137.
A "willful" act may be described as one done intention-
ally, knowingly, and purposely, without justifiable excuse,
as distinguished from an act done carelessly, thoughtlessly,
heedlessly, or inadvertently. Lobdell Car Wheel Co. v.
Subielski, 125 A. 462, 464, 2 W.W.Harr. (Del.) 462.
A willful differs essentially from a negligent act. The
one is positive and the other negative. Sturm v. Atlantic
Mut. Ins. Co., 38 N.Y.Super.Ct. 317; Thayer v. Denver &
R. G. R. Co., 21 N.M. 330, 154 P. 691, 694. Simple negli-
gence arises merely from heedlessness, and consists simply
of facts of nonfeasance, and is therefore incompatible with
willfulness, which comprises acts of aggressive wrong,
Stauffer v. Schlegel, 74 Ind.App. 431, 129 N.E. 44, 46; and
presupposes a conscious purpose to injure, In re Cunning-
ham, D.C.N.Y., 253 F. 663, 665; Ft. Wayne & Wabash
Valley Traction Co. v. Justus, 180 Ind. 464, 115 N.E. 585,
587; Brittain v. Southern Ry. Co., 167 N.C. 642, 83 S.E.
702, 703.
"Willfulness" implies an act done intentionally and de-
signedly; "wantonness" implies action without regard
to the rights of others, a conscious failure to observe care,
a conscious invasion of the rights of others, willful, unre-
strained action; and "recklessness" a disregard of con-
sequences, an indifference whether a wrong or injury is
done or not, and an indifference to natural and probable
consequences. Jensen v. Denver & R. G. R. Co., 44 Utah,
100, 138 P. 1185, 1188. See, also, Evans v. Illinois Cent. R.
Co., 289 Mo. 493, 233 S.W. 397, 399; Cover v. Hershey
Transit Co., 290 Pa. 551, 139 A. 266, 268; Feore v. Tram-
mel, 212 Ala. 325, 102 So. 529, 533; Crosman v. Southern
Pac. Co., 44 Nev. 2E46, 194 P. 839, 843.
The word "reckless," as applied to negligence, is the
legal equivalent of "willful" or "wanton." Heller v. New
York, N. H. & H. R. Co., C.C.A.N.Y., 265 F. 192, 194. And
see Strough v. Central R. Co. of New Jersey, C.C.A.N.J.,
209 F. 23, 26.
Conscious; knowing; done with stubborn pur-
pose, but not with malice. Bundy v. State, 206
606; Helme v. Great Western Milling Co., 43 Cal.
App. 416, 185 P. 510, 512; Gray v. Alabama Fuel &
Iron Co., 216 Ala. 416, 113 So. 35, 39.
Premeditated; malicious; done with evil in-
tent, or with a bad motive or purpose, or with
indifference to the natural consequences; unlaw-
ful; without legal justification. State v. Vander-
veer, 11-5 Wash. 184, 196 P. 650; State v. Johnson,
194 N.C. 378, 139 S.E. 697, 698; Boyce v. Greeley
Square Hotel Co., 228 N.Y. 106, 126 N.E. 647, 649;
State v. Palmer, 94 Vt. 278, 110 A. 436, 437.
Words which import an exercise of the will, such as
"feloniously," "maliciously," and "unlawfully," will sup-
ply the place of the word "willfully" in an indictment.
Howenstine v. U. S., C.C.A.Cal., 263 F. 1, 3; Chapman v.
Corn., 5 Whart. (Pa.) 427, 34 Am.Dec. 565. Contra, State v.
Waters, Mo.App., 189 S.W. 624; State v. Hyman, 116 Me.
419, 102 A. 231, 232.

## WILLFUL AND MALICIOUS INJURY

The
word "willful," as used in this phrase in the Bank-
ruptcy Act July 1, 1898. c. 541, § 17(2), 30 Stat.
550, as amended by the Act of Feb. 5, 1903, c.
487, 32 Stat. 797 (11 § 35), means inten-
tional though not necessarily deliberate. Nunn
v. Drieborg, 235 Mich. 383, 209 N.W. 89, 90; Well-
man v. Mead, 93 Vt. 322, 107 A. 396, 404. Mere
negligence is not enough; In re Roberts, D.C.
Mich., 290 F. 257, 259; In re Byrne, C.C.A.N.Y., 296
F. 98, 100; there must be an intent to commit a
wrong either through actual malice or from which
malice will be implied; McClellan v. Schmidt, D.
C.N.J., 235 F. 986, 987. Such an injury does not
necessarily involve hatred or ill will, as a state of
mind, but arises from intentional wrong commit-
ted without just cause or excuse. In re Wernecke,
D.C.N.Y., 1 F.Supp. 127, 168. It may involve
merely a willful disregard of what one knows to be
his duty, an act which is against good morals and
wrongful in and of itself, and which necessarily
causes injury and is done intentionally. In re
Stenger, D.C.Mich., 283 F. 419, 420; In re Phil-
lips, D.C.Ohio, 298 F. 135, 138.

## WILLFUL AND WANTON INJURY

To con-
stitute such injury, act producing injury must
have been knowingly and intentionally committed,
or committed under circumstances evincing reck-
less disregard of safety of person injured. Price
v. Gabel, 162 Wash. 275, 298 P. 444, 447.

## WILLFUL INDIFFERENCE TO THE SAFETY OF OTHERS

Imports an intentional lack of
regard concerning the safety of others, or an in-
tentional doing of something with knowledge that
serious injury is a probable result. People v.
Murray, 58 Cal.App.2d 239, 136 P.2d 389, 391.

## WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF EMPLOYEE

Un-
der Workmen's Compensation Acts, precluding
compensation, means more than mere negligence,
and contemplates the intentional doing of some-
thing with knowledge that it is likely to result in
serious injuries, or with reckless disregard of its
probable consequences. Carroll v. ' Etna Life Ins.
Co., 39 Ga.App. 78, 146 S.E. 788, 789; Black Moun-
tain Corporation v. Higgins, 226 Ky. 7, 10 S.W.2d
WILLFUL OR WANTON MISCONDUCT. Fail-
ure to exercise ordinary care to prevent injury to a
person who is actually known to be or reasonably
expected to be within the range of a dangerous
act being done. Georgia Power Co. v. Deese, 78
Ga.App. 704, 51 S.E.2d 724, 728.

## WILLFUL OR WANTON NEGLIGENCE

Fail-
ure to exercise ordinary care to prevent injury to
a person who is actually known to be, or reason-
ably is expected to be, within range of a known
danger. Barall Food Stores v. Bennett, 194 Okl.
508, 153 P.2d 106, 109, 110.

## WILLFUL TORT

Implies intent or purpose to
injure. Cousins v. Booksbaum, 51 Ohio App. 150,
200 N.E. 133, 135; American Casualty Co. v. Brin-
sky, 51 Ohio App. 298, 200 N.E. 654, 655.
It involves elements of intent or purpose and malice or
ill will, but malice or ill will may be shown by indifference
to safety of others, with knowledge of their danger, or
failure to use ordinary care to avoid injury after acquiring
such knowledge. Hillard v. Western & Southern Life Ins.
Co., 68 Ohio App. 426, 34 N.E.2d 75, 77.

## WILLFUL MURDER

The unlawful and inten-
tional killing of another without excuse or miti-
gating circumstances. State v. Dalton, 178 N.C.
779, 101 S.E. 548, 549.

## WILLFUL NEGLIGENCE

See Negligence.

## WILLINGLY

Voluntarily; unreluctantly; with-
out reluctance, and of one's own free choice. Ed-
wards v. State, 21 Ala.App. 375, 108 So. 639, 640.
See State v. Schwab, 109 Ohio St. 532, 143 N.E.
29, 31. As used in an instruction that one cannot
invoke the doctrine of self-defense if he enters
a fight willingly, it means voluntarily, aggressive-
ly, and without legal excuse. State v. Evans, 194
N.C. 121, 138 S.E. 518, 519.

## WILLS ACT

In England. The statute 32 Hen.

## VIII

c. 1, passed in 1540, by which persons seized
in fee-simple of lands holden in socage tenure
were enabled to devise the same at their will and
pleasure, except to bodies corporate; and those
who held estates by the tenure of chivalry were
enabled to devise two-third parts thereof.
Also, the statute 7 Wm. IV. & 1 Vict. c. 26,
passed in 1837, and also called "Lord Langdale's
Act." This act permits of the disposition by will
of every kind of interest in real and personal es-
tate, and provides that all wills, whether of real
or of personal estate, shall be attested by two wit-
nesses, and that such attestation shall be suffi-
cient. Other important alterations are effected by
this statute in the law of wills. Mozley & White-
ley.

## WINCHESTER MEASURE

The standard meas-
ure of England, originally kept at Winchester. 1
Bl.Comm. 274.

## WINCHESTER, STATUTE OF

A statute passed
in the thirteenth year of the reign of Edward I.,
by which the old Saxon law of police was en-
forced, with many additional provisions. 2 Reeve,
Eng.Law, 163; Crabb, Hist.Eng.Law, 189. It re-
quired every man to provide himself with armor
to aid in keeping the peace; and if it did not
create the offices of high and petty constables, it
recognized and regulated them, and charged them
with duties answering somewhat to those of our
militia officers. The statute took its name from
the ancient capital of the kingdom. It was re-
pealed by the Statute of 7 & 8 Geo. IV. c. 27. See
1 Seld.Essays 153.

## WIND SHIELD

tween the two front standards or posts ;—not or-
dinarily including wind deflectors placed outside of
such standards. Hammond v. Benzer Corporation,

the assets of a partnership or corporation, for the
purpose of making distribution and dissolving the
concern. State v. Norman, 86 Okl. 36, 206 P. 522,
527; State v. Quigley, 93 Okl. 296, 220 P. 918; Bar-
ret v. Skalsky, 118 Kan. 162, 233 P. 1043.

a view or prospect. Hale v. Ins. Co., 46 Mo.App.
508; Benner v. Benner, 119 Me. 79, 109 A. 376, 377.
The use of this word in law is chiefly in con-
nection with the doctrine of ancient lights and
other rights of adjacent owners.

## WINDOW ENVELOPE

One which has on its
face a patch of transparent paper forming a win-
dow through which an address written upon an
inclosure can be seen. Outlook Envelope Co. v.
Samuel Cupples Envelope Co., C.C.A.N.Y., 223 F.
327, 329.

## WINDOW TAX

A tax on windows, levied on
houses which contained more than six windows,
and were worth more than £5 per annum; estab-
lished by St. 7 Wm. III. c. 18. St. 14 & 15 Vict.

## WISBY, LAWS OF

The name given to a code of
maritime laws promulgated at Wisby, then the
capital of Gothland, in Sweden, in the latter part
of the thirteenth century. This compilation re-
sembled the laws of Oleron in many respects, and
was early adopted, as a system of sea laws, by
the commercial nations of Northern Europe. It
formed the foundation for the subsequent code of
the Hanseatic League. A translation of the Laws
of Wisby may be seen in the appendix to 1 Pet.
Adm. And see 3 Kent, Comm. 13. They are also
printed in 30 F.Cas. 1189.

## WISTA

In Saxon law. Half a hide of land, or
sixty acres.

## WIT

To know; to learn; to be informed. Used
only in the infinitive, to wit, which term is equiva-
lent to "that is to say," "namely," or "videlicet."
WITAM. The purgation from an offense by the
WITAN. In Saxon law. Wise men; persons of
information, especially in the laws; the king's ad-
visers; members of the king's council; the opti-
mates, or principal men of the kingdom. 1 Spence,
Eq. Jur. 11, note.

## WITCHCRAFT

Under Sts. 33 Hen. VIII. c. 8, and
1 Jac. I. c. 12, the offense of witchcraft, or sup-
posed intercourse with evil spirits, was punish-
able with death. These acts were not repealed
till 1736. 4 Bl.Comm. 60, 61. In Salem, in 1692,
20 persons were put to death by hanging. The last
victims in England were executed in 1716, and the
last in Scotland in 1722. 29 Encyc. Americana,
430, 431; 1 Beard, Rise of Amer. Civilization, 150.

## WITE

Sax. A punishment, pain, penalty, mulct,
or criminal fine. Cowell.
An atonement among the early Germans by a
wrong-doer to the king or the community. It is
said to be the germ of the idea that wrong is not
simply the affair of the injured individual, and
is therefore a condition precedent to the growth
of a criminal law. 2 Holdsw. Hist. E. L. 37. See
1 Sel.Essays, Anglo-Amer. L. H. 100.

## WITEKDEN

A taxation of the West Saxons, im-
posed by the public council of the kingdom.

## WITENA DOM

In Saxon law. The judgment of
the county court, or other court of competent ju-
risdiction, on the title to property, real or personal.
1 Spence, Eq.Jur. 22.

## WITENAGEMOTE

(Spelled, also, witenagemot,
wittenagemot, witanagemote, etc.) "The assem-
bly of wise men." This was the great national
council or parliament of the Saxons in England,
comprising the noblemen, high ecclesiastics, and
other great thanes of the kingdom, advising and
aiding the king in the general administration of
government.
It was the grand council of the kingdom, and was held,
generally, in the open air, by public notice or particular
summons, in or near some city or populous town. These
notices or summonses were issued upon determination by
the king's select council, or the body met without notice,
when the throne was vacant, to elect a new king. Subse-
quently to the Norman Conquest it was called commune
concilium regni, curia regis and finally parliament; but
its character had become considerably changed. It was a
court of last resort, more especially for determining dis-
putes between the king and his thanes, and, ultimately,
from all inferior tribunals. Great offenders, particularly
those who were members of or might be summoned to
the king's court, were here tried. The casual loss of title-
deeds was supplied, and a very extensive equity jurisdic-
tion .exercised. 1 Spence, Eq.Jur. 73; 1 Bla.Comm. 147;
1 Reeve, Hist.Eng.Law 7; 9 Co.Pref. It passed out of ex-
istence with the Norman Conquest, and the subsequent
Parliament was a separate growth, and not a continuation
of the Witenagemot. 29 Encyc. Americana, 432.

## WITENS

The chiefs of the Saxon lords or
thanes, their nobles, and wise men.

## WITH

A word denoting a relation of proximity,
contiguity, or association. White v. White, 183
Va. 239, 31 S.E.2d 558, 561. Sometimes equivalent
to the words, "in addition to," but not synonymous
• specified sum, "with interest." Halpern v. Lang-
rock Bros. Co., 169 App.Div. 464, 155 N.Y.S. 167,
WITH ALL FAULTS. This phrase, used in a
contract of sale, implies that the purchaser as-
sumes the risk of all defects and imperfections,
provided they do not destroy the identity of the
thing sold.

## WITH CONSENT

Phrase within a Constitution
providing that Governor shall appoint officers
with consent of senate, requires confirmation by
senate and appointment under such provision is
ineffective until confirmed. State, ex rel. Nagle v.
Stafford, 97 Mont. 275, 34 P.2d 372, 379.

## WITH PREJUDICE

The term, as applied to
judgment of dismissal is as conclusive of rights
of parties as if action had been prosecuted to final
adjudication adverse to the plaintiff. Fenton v.
Thompson, 352 Mo. 199, 176 S.W.2d 456, 460.

## WITH STRONG HAND

In pleading. A techni-
cal phrase indispensable in describing a forcible
entry in an indictment. No other word or cir-
cumlocution will answer the same purpose. Rex

joyed; to take from. Central R. & B. Co. v. State,

from a bank or other place of deposit. Hensch
v. Metropolitan Savings & Loan Co., 50 Ohio App.
25, 197 N.E. 416, 418.

## WITHDRAWING A JUROR

In practice. The
withdrawing of one of the twelve jurors from the
box, with the result that, the jury being now
found to be incomplete, no further proceedings
can be had in the cause. The withdrawing of
a juror is always by the agreement of the parties,
and is frequently done at the recommendation of
the judge, where it is doubtful whether the action
will lie; and in such case the consequence is that
each party pays his own costs (in Pennsylvania
it is held that the costs abide the event of the
suit). It is, however, no bar to a future action
for the same cause. 2 Tidd, Pr. 861, 862; 1 Archb.
Pr.K.B. 196; Wabash R. Co. v. McCormick, 23
Ind.App. 258, 55 N.E. 251; People v. Judges of
New York, 8 Cow. (N.Y.) 127; Glendenning v.
Canary, 64 N.Y. 636; Wolcott v. Studebaker, C.C.
Ill., 34 F. 8; 3 Term 657; 1 Cr. M. & R. 64; Tr.
& H. Pr. § 689; Ry. & M. 402; 3 B. & Ad. 349; 3
Chitty, Pr. 917. In American practice, it is usually
a mere method of continuing a case, for some good
reason. The cases are collected in a note in 48 L.
R.A. 432.

## WITHDRAWAL OF CHARGES

A failure to
prosecute by the person preferring charges;—dis-
tinguished from a dismissal, which is a determina-
tion of their invalidity by the tribunal hearing
them. Butler v. McSweeney, 222 Mass. 5, 109 N.E.

## WITHDRAWING RECORD

In practice. The
withdrawing by a plaintiff of the nisi prius or
trial record filed in a cause, just before the trial
is entered upon, for the purpose of preventing
the cause from being tried. This may be done
before the jury are sworn, and afterwards, by
consent of the defendant's counsel. 2 Tidd, Pr.
851; 1 Archb. Pr. K. B. 189; 3 Chit.Pr. 870; 2 C.
& P. 185; 3 Camp. 333.

## WITHERNAM

In practice. A taking by way of
reprisal; a taking or a reprisal of other goods, in
lieu of those that were formerly taken and
eloigned or withholden. 2 Inst. 141. A reciprocal
distress, in lieu of a previous one which has been
eloigned. 3 Bl.Comm. 148.
The name of a writ which issues on the return
of elongata to an alias or pluries writ of replevin,
by which the sheriff is commanded to take the
defendant's own goods which may be found in his
bailiwick, and keep them safely, not to deliver
them to the plaintiff until such time as the de-
fendant chooses to submit himself and allow the
distress, and the whole of it to be replevied; and
he is thereby further commanded that he do re-
turn to the court in what manner he shall have
executed the writ. Hamm.N.P. 453; 2 Inst. 140;
Fitzh.N.B. 68, 69.

## WITHERSAKE

An apostate, or perfidious rene-
gade. Cowell.

## WITHHOLD

To retain in one's possession that
which belongs to or is claimed or sought by an-
other. Fitzpatrick v. Garver, 253 Mo. 189, 161
S.W. 714, 715. To omit to disclose upon request;
as, to withhold information. State v. Sharp, 121
Minn. 381, 141 N.W. 526, 527, 528. To refrain from
paying that which is due. Dupuy v. Board of Edu-
cation of City and County of San Francisco, 106
Cal.App. 533, 289 P. 689, 691.
Withholding means of support from depend-
ents. Made felony by a statute, presupposes
existence or ability to obtain means of support
by accused, and need by alleged dependents from
whom support is withheld. McBrayer v. State,
112 Fla. 415, 150 So. 736, 737.

## WITHIN

Into. State v. Warburton, 97 Wash.
242, 166 P. 615, 617. In inner or interior part of, or
not longer in time than. In re White's Estate,
130 Kan. 714, 288 P. 764, 765. Through. Missis-
sippi Cent. R. Co. v. Pace, 109 Miss. 667, 68 So.
926, 927. Inside the limits of. Sacks v. Legg, 219
Ill.App. 144, 148; Ex parte Watson, 82 W.Va. 201,
95 S.E. 648. On. Continental Life Ins. Co. v.
Wilson, 36 Ga.App. 540, 137 S.E. 403.
When used relative to time, has been defined variously
as meaning any time before; at or before; at the end of ;
before the expiration of ; not beyond; not exceeding; not
later than. Glenn v. Garrett, Tex.Civ.App., 84 S.W.2d 515,
The use of the word "within" as a limit of time, or de-
gree, or space, embraces the last day, or degree, or entire
distance, covered by the limit fixed. Rice v. J. H. Beavers
& Co., 196 Ala. 355, 71 So. 659; Ardery v. Dunn, 181 Ind.
225, 104 N.E. 299, 300; Laws N.Y. 1910, c. 347.

## WITHOUT

Outside; beyond. Welton v. Mis-
9 Mass. 456; Collins v. Morgan, C.C.A.Kan., 243
F. 495, 498. In excess of. Milwaukee Western
Fuel Co. v. Industrial Commission of Wisconsin,
159 Wis. 635, 150 N.W. 998, 999.

## WITHOUT DAY

A term used to signify that an
adjournment or continuance is indefinite or final,
or that no subsequent time is fixed for another
meeting, or for further proceedings. See Sine Die.

## WITHOUT DELAY

Instantly; at once. Rathbun
v. Globe Indemnity Co., 107 Neb. 18, 184 N.W. 903,
908, 24 A.L.R. 191. Also, within the time allowed
by law. See State v. Dolan, Mo.App., 216 S.W. 334.

## WITHOUT GIVING COMPENSATION THERE- FOR

This phrase within automobile guest stat-
ute indicates an intention to exclude application of
"guest" designation not only to one who has paid
cash or equivalent for his transportation but also
to one who pays such recompense as makes it
worth the other's while to furnish the ride. Du-
clos v. Tashjian, 32 Cal.App.2d 444, 90 P.2d 140,
WITHOUT HER CONSENT. This phrase, as used
in the law of rape, is equivalent to "against the
will," and signifies the manifestation of the ut-
most reluctance and greatest resistance on the
woman's part. State v. Catron, 317 Mo. 894, 296
S.W. 141, 143.

## WITHOUT IMPEACHMENT OF WASTE

The
effect of the insertion of this clause in a lease
for life is to give the tenant the right to cut tim-
ber on the estate, without making himself there-
by liable to an action for waste. When a tenant
for life holds the land without impeachment of
waste, he is, of course, dispunishable for waste,
whether wilful or otherwise. But still this right
must not be wantonly abused so as to destroy the
estate; and he will be enjoined from committing
malicious waste. Bac.Abr. Waste (N) ; 2 Eq.Cas.
Abr. Waste (A, pl. 8). And see Derham v. Hovey,
195 Mich. 243, 161 N.W. 883, 884, 21 A.L.R. 999.

## WITHOUT JUSTIFICATION

In a statute pun-
ishing any parent who willfully or without justi-
fication deserts a child under 16 years of age in
destitute or necessitous circumstances, the term
"without justification" is equivalent to "willfully."
Ex parte Strong, 95 Tex.Cr.R. 250, 252 S.W. 767,
WITHOUT NOTICE. As used of purchasers, etc.,
equivalent to "in good faith." Hunt v. Gragg, 19
N.M. 450, 145 P. 136, 138.

## WITHOUT PREJUDICE

Where an offer or ad-
mission is made "without prejudice," or a motion
is denied or a suit dismissed "without prejudice,"
it is meant as a declaration that no rights or privi-
leges of the party concerned are to be considered
as thereby waived or lost except in so far as may
be expressly conceded or decided. See Genet v.
Delaware & H. Canal Co., 170 N.Y. 278, 63 N.E.
350; O'Keefe v. Irvington Real Estate Co., 87 Md.
196, 39 Atl. 428; Olson v. Coalfield School Dist.
No. 16 of Divide County, 54 N.D. 657, 210 N.W.
A dismissal "without prejudice" allows a new
suit to be brought on the same cause of action.
Freidenbloom v. McAfee, Tex.Civ.App., 167 S.W.
28; McIntyre v. McIntyre, 205 Mich. 496, 171 N.W.
393, 394.
The words "without prejudice" import into any transac-
tion that the parties have agreed that as between them-
selves the receipt of money by one and its payment by the
other shall not of themselves have any legal effect on the
rights of the parties, but they shall be open to settlement
by legal controversy as if the money had not been paid. In
re Bell, 344 Pa. 223, 25 A.2d 344, 350.
The words "without prejudice", as used in judgment,
ordinarily import the contemplation of further proceedings,
and, when they appear in an order or decree, it shows
that the judicial act is not intended to be res judicata of
the merits of the controversy. Fiumara v. American Sure-
ty Co. of New York, 346 Pa. 584, 31 A.2d 283, 287.

## WITHOUT RECOURSE

This phrase, used in
making a qualified indorsement of a negotiable in-
strument, signifies that the indorser means to
save himself from liability to subsequent holders,
and is a notification that, if payment is refused
by the parties primarily liable, recourse cannot
be had to him. See Thompson v. First State
Bank, 102 Ga. 696, 29 S.E. 610; Binswanger v.
Hewitt, 79 Misc, 425, 140 N.Y.S. 143, 145.
An indorser "without recourse" specially declines to
assume any responsibility for payment. Arthur v. Rosier,
217 Mo.App. 382, 266 S.W. 737, 738. He assumes no con-
tractual liability by virtue of the indorsement itself, Kalil
v. Bell, 88 Kan. 666, 129 P. 1135, 1136; and becomes a mere
assignor of the title to the paper, Cameron v. Ham, 23
Ohio App. 359, 155 N.E. 655, 656; but such an indorse-
ment does not indicate that the indorsee takes with notice
of defects, or that he does not take on credit of the other
parties to the note, Robertson v. American Inv. Co., 170
Ark. 413, 279 S.W. 1008. 1010.
Where a note and mortgage are transferred without re-
course, legal effect of words "without recourse" constitutes
indorser a mere assignor subject to no liability except as
an implied guarantor that instruments are genuine, that
he has good title to them, and that he is not aware of any
illegality in them. Home Ins. Co. v. Citizens Bank, 181
Miss. 181, 178 So. 589, 590.

## WITHOUT RESERVE

A term applied to a sale
by auction, indicating that no price is reserved.

## WITHOUT STINT

Without limit; without any
specified number.

## WITHOUT THE STATE

This phrase, in a stat-
ute providing that in computing limitations, the
time during which the defendant shall be without
the state shall be excluded, has no relation to
mere temporary absence from domicile or resi-
dence in the state. Clegg v. Bishop, 105 Conn.

## 564, 136 A. 102, 104, WITHOUT THIS, THAT

In pleading. Formal
words used in pleadings by way of traverse, par-
ticularly by way of special traverse, (q. v.,) im-
porting an express denial of some matter of fact
alleged in a previous pleading, including the dec-
laration, plea, replication, etc. Steph.P1. 168, 169,
179, 180. The Latin term is absque hoc. Com.Dig.
Pleader (G 1) ; 1 Chitty, Pl. 576, note a.

## WITNESS AGAINST HIMSELF

The federal
constitutional provision that no person shall be
compelled in any criminal case, to be a "witness
against himself" must be applied in a broad spirit
to secure to citizen immunity from self-accusa-
tion and provision applies to all proceedings
Wherein defendant is acting as a witness in any
investigation that requires him to give testimony
that might tend to show him guilty of crime.
U.S.C.A.Const. Amend. 5. United States v. Good-
ner, D.C.Colo., 35 F.Supp. 286, 290.

## WITNESSING PART

In a deed or other formal
instrument, is that part which comes after the
parties. It usually commences with a reference
to the agreement or intention to be effectuated,
then states or refers to the consideration, and
concludes with the operative words and parcels, if
any. Where a deed effectuates two distinct ob-
jects, there are two witnessing parts. 1 Day.Prec.
Cony. 63, et seq.; Sweet.

## WITTINGLY

## WOLF'S HEAD

In old English law. This term
was used as descriptive of the condition of an out-

were to be brought to the king, and if they de-
fended themselves they might be slain and their
heads carried to the king, for they were no more
to be accounted of than wolves. Termes de la Ley,
"Woolferthfod."
WOMEN. All the females of the human species.
All such females who have arrived at the age of
puberty. Dig. 50, 16, 13.

## WONG

Cowell.
WdOD. The tough, hard substance of all trees
and shrubs. It includes not only the hard fiber
bundles of trees and shrubs in general, but also
the tougher fibrous components of some herba-
ceous plants. It is a very broad term and includes
not only material obtained from exogenous plants,
but also like substances obtained from palms, from
bamboo (which is a giant grass), and from some
ferns (which are herbaceous plants). Steinhardt
& Bro. v. U. S., 9 Ct.Cust.App. 62, 63.

## WOOD LEAVE

## WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION ACTS

Laws
passed in most of the states of the Union which
provide for fixed awards to employees or their
dependents in case of industrial accidents and
dispense with proof of negligence and legal ac-
tions. Some of the acts go beyond the simple
determination of the right to compensation, and
provide insurance systems, either under state su-
pervision or otherwise.
Under the acts, methods are usually prescribed
for the expression by employers and workmen of
their preference as to the acceptance or rejection
of the compensation system. This ranges from
each workman filing a written rejection to a pre-
sumed acceptance in the absence of formal rejec-
tion.
Under the elective system in most of the states,
it is made an inducement, that where employers
refuse to come within the provisions of the com-
pensation law, the customary defenses to actions
for injuries shall not be allowed them.

commencement of a suit or other proceeding or as
incidental to its progress, and requiring the per-
formance of a specified act, or giving authority
and commission to have it done.
A mandatory precept issuing from court of
justice. Poirier v. East Coast Realty Co., 84 N.H.
461, 152 A. 612, 613. Process. State ex rel. Wall-
ing v. Sullivan, 245 Wis. 180, 13 N.W.2d 550, 555.
For the names and description of various par-
ticular writs, see the titles below.
Old English Law
An instrument in the form of a letter; a letter
or letters of attorney. This is a very ancient sense
of the word.
In the old books, "writ" is used as equivalent to
"action;" hence writs are sometimes divided into
real, personal, and mixed.
Scotch Law
A writing; an instrument in writing, as a
deed, bond, contract, etc. 2 Forb. Inst. pt. 2, pp.
175-179.
General
Alias writ. A second writ issued in the same
cause, where a former writ of the same kind has
been issued without effect.
Close writ. In English law, a name given to
certain letters of the sovereign, sealed with his
great seal and directed to particular persons and
for particular purposes, which, not being proper
for public inspection, were closed up and sealed on
the outside; also, a writ directed to the sheriff
instead of to the lord. 2 BLComm. 346; 3 Reeve,
Eng. Law. 45.
Concurrent writs. Duplicate originals, or sev-
eral writs running at the same time for the same
purpose, for service on or arrest of a person, when
it is not known where he is to be found; or for
service on several persons, as when there are
several defendants to an action. Mozley & Whit-
ley.
Judicial writs. In English practice. The capias
and all other writs subsequent to the original writ
not issuing out of chancery, but from the court to
which the original was returnable. Being ground-
ed on what had passed in that court in conse-
quence of the sheriff's return, they were called
judicial writs, in contradistinction to the writs
issued out of chancery, which were called original
writs. 3 Bl.Comm. 282. Such writs as issue un-
der the private seal of the courts, and not under
the great seal of England, and are tested or wit-
nessed, not in the king's name, but in the name of
the chief judge of the court out of which they is-
sue. The word "judicial" is used in contradis-
tinction to "original;" original writs being such
as issue out of chancery under the great seal,
and are witnessed in the king's name. See 3 Bl.
Comm. 282. Pullman's Palace-Car Co. v. Wash-
burn, C.C.Mass., 66 F. 792.
Junior writ. One which is issued, or comes to
the officer's hands, at a later time than a similar
writ, at the suit of another party, or on a different
claim, against the same defendant.
Original writ. In English practice. An original
writ was the process formerly in use for the com-
mencement of personal actions. It was a manda-
tory letter from the king, issuing out of chancery,
sealed with the great seal, and directed to the
sheriff of the county wherein the injury was com-
mitted, or was supposed to have been committed,
requiring him to command the wrong-doer or ac-
cused party either to do justice to the plaintiff or
else to appear in court and answer the accusation
against him. This writ is now disused, the writ
of summons being the process prescribed by the
uniformity of process act for commencing per-
sonal actions; and under the judicature act, 1873,
all suits, even in the court of chancery, are to be
commenced by such writs of summons. Brown.
Patent writ. In old practice, an open writ; one
not closed or sealed up.
Peremptory writ. An original writ, called from
the words of the writ a "si to fecerit securum," and
which directed the sheriff to cause the defendant
to appear in court without any option given him,
provided the plaintiff gave the sheriff security ef-
fectually to prosecute his claim. The writ was
very occasionally in use, and only where nothing
was specifically demanded, but only a satisfac-
tion in general; as in the case of writs of tres-
pass on the case, wherein no debt or other spe-
cific thing was sued for, but only damages to be
assessed by a jury. Brown.
Prerogative writs. Those issued by the exercise
of the extraordinary power of the crown (the
namely, the writs of procedendo, mandamus, pro-
hibition, quo warranto, habeas corpus, and cer-
tiorari.

## WRIT OF ASSISTANCE

The name of a writ
which issues from the court of chancery, in aid
of the execution of a judgment at law, to put the
complainant into possession of lands adjudged ta
him, when the sheriff cannot execute the judg-
ment. Emerick v. Miller, Ind.App., 62 N.E. 285;
Hagerman v. Heltzel, 21 Wash. 444, 58 R 580;
Marblehead Land Co. v. Los Angeles County, D.C..
Cal., 276 F. 305.
A form of process issued by an equity court
to transfer the possession of lands, title or posses-
sion to which it has previously adjudicated, as a
means of enforcing its decree, and performs the
same office in a suit in equity as an execution in
an action at law. Burney v. Lee, 57 Ariz. 41, 110
P.2d 554, 556. Its office is confined to lend aid to
original equity jurisdiction, and the writ cannot
be employed as a substitute for other common-law
or statutory actions. Patterson v. McKay, 202
Ark. 241, 150 S.W.2d 196. It is essentially a man-
datory injunction, effect of which is to bring about
a change in the possession of realty—it dispossess-
es the occupant and gives possession to one ad-
judged entitled thereto by the court. Dusbabek
v. Local Building & Loan Ass'n, 178 Okl. 592, 63
P.2d 756, 759.
A "writ of assistance" is equivalent to the writ of ha-
bere facias possessionem at law, and issues as of course
without notice, so far as the parties to the record are con-
cerned, when necessary to execute a decree. Gardner v.
Duncan, 104 Miss. 477, 61 So. 545, 546.
While the office of both a writ of assistance and a writ
of possession is to put the party entitled thereto into the
possession of property, the former issues from equity and
the latter from law. Southern State Bank v. Leverette,
187 N.C. 743, 123 S.E. 68, 70.
An ancient writ issuing out of the exchequer.
Moz. & W. A writ issuing from the court of ex-
chequer to the sheriff commanding him to be in
aid of the king's tenants by knight's service, or
the king's collectors, debtors, or accountants,
to enforce payment of their own dues, in order to
enable them to pay their own dues to the king. 1
Madox, Hist. Exch. 675.

## WRIT OF ASSOCIATION

In English practice.
of assize and his subordinate officers) are directed
to associate themselves with the justices and ser-
jeants; and they are required to admit the said
persons into their society in order to take the as-
sizes. 3 Bl.Comm. 59.

## WRIT OF ATTACHMENT

A writ employed to
enforce obedience to an order or judgment of the
court. It may take the form of commanding the
sheriff to attach the disobedient party and to have
him before the court to answer his contempt.
Smith, Act. 176.
In its generic sense, any mesne civil process in
the nature of a writ on which property may be at-
tached, including trustee process. Smith v. Smith,
120 Me. 379, 115 A. 87, 88. See, also, Attachment.

## WRIT OF CONSPIRACY

A writ which anciently
lay against persons who had conspired to injure
the plaintiff, under the same circumstances which
would now give him an action on the case. It
did not lie at common law, in any case, except
when the conspiracy was to indict the party either
of treason or felony; all the other cases of con-
spiracy in the books were but actions on the case.
Hutchins v. Hutchins, 7 Hill (N.Y.) 104.

## WRIT OF COVENANT

A writ which lies where
a party claims damages for breach of covenant;
1. e., of a promise under seal.

## WRIT OF DEBT

A writ which lies where the
party claims the recovery of a debt; i. e., a liqui-
dated or certain sum of money alleged to be due
to him.
This is debt in the debet, which is the principal and
only common for. There is another species mentioned in
the books, called the debt in the detinet, which lies for the
specific recovery of goods under a contract to deliver them.
1 Chitty, Pl. 101.

## WRIT OF DECEIT

The name of a writ which
lies where one man has done anything in the
name of another, by which the latter is damnified
and deceived. Fitzh.Nat.Brev. 95, E.

## WRIT OF DELIVERY

A writ of execution em-
ployed to enforce a judgment for the delivery of
chattels. It commands the sheriff to cause the
chattels mentioned in the writ to be returned to
the person who has obtained the judgment; and,
if the chattels cannot be found, to distrain the
person against whom the judgment was given un-
til he returns them. Smith, Act. 175; Sweet.

## WRIT OF DETINUE

A writ which lies where a
party claims the specific recovery of goods and
chattels, or deeds and writings, detained from
him. This is seldom used; trover is the more
frequent remedy, in cases where it may be
brought.

## WRIT OF DOWER

This is either a writ of dower
unde nihil habet, which lies for a widow, com-
manding the tenant to assign her dower, no part
of which has yet been set off to her; or a writ of
right of dower, whereby she seeks to recover the
remainder of the dower to which she is entitled,
part having been already received from the ten-
WRIT OF EJECTMENT. The writ in an action of
ejectment, for the recovery of lands. See Eject-
ment.

## WRIT OF ENTRY

A real action to recover the
possession of land where the tenant (or owner)
has been disseised or otherwise wrongfully dis-
possessed. If the disseisor has aliened the land,
or if it has descended to his heir, the writ of entry
is said to be in the per, because it alleges that the
defendant (the alienee or heir) obtained posses..
sion through the original disseisor. If two alien-
ations (or descents) have taken place, the writ
is in the per and cui, because it alleges that the
defendant (the second alienee) obtained posses-
sion through the first alienee, to whom the origi-
nal disseisor had aliened it. If more than two
alienations (or descents) have taken place, the
writ is in the post, because it simply alleges that
the defendant acquired possession after the origi-
nal disseisin. Co.Litt. 238b; 3 Bl.Comm. 180.
The writ of entry was abolished, with other real
actions, in England, by St. 3 & 4 Wm. IV. c. 27,
§ 36, but is still in use in a few of the states of
the Union. Sweet. See, also, Entry, Writ of.

## WRIT OF ERROR

A writ issued from a court of
appellate jurisdiction, directed to the judge or
judges of a court of record, requiring them to re-
mit to the appellate court the record of an action
before them, in which a final judgment has been
entered, in order that examination may be made
of certain errors alleged to have been committed,
and that the judgment may be reversed, correct-
ed, or affirmed, as the case may require. Siegel-
schiffer v. Penn Mut. Life Ins. Co., C.C.A.N.Y.,
248 F. 226, 228; Ward v. Williams, 270 Ill. 547, 110
N.E. 821, 823; Board of County Com'rs of Har-
ford County v. Jay, 122 Md. 324, 89 A. 715, 717.
It is brought for supposed error in law apparent
on record and takes case to higher tribunal, which
affirms or reverses. Chambers v. State, 117 Fla.
642, 158 So. 153. It is commencement of new suit
to set aside judgment, and is not continuation of
suit to which it relates. Winchester v. Winn, 225
Mo.App. 288, 29 S.W.2d 188, 190. And unless
abolished by statute, is writ of right applicable to
all cases in which jurisdiction is exercised accord-
ing to course of common law, but is inapplicable
to cases not known to or in derogation of common
law, unless otherwise provided by statute. Free-
port Motor Casualty Co. v. Madden, 354 Ill. 329,
188 N.E. 415, 416.
"Appeal" is a process of civil law origin that entirely re-
moves cause to appellate court subjecting facts as well as
law to review and retrial, while "writ of error" is a proc-
ess of common-law origin and removes nothing to appellate
court for re-examination except the law. Whidden v. Ab-
bott, 119 Fla. 25, 160 So. 475.

## WRIT OF ERROR CORAM NOBIS

A common-
law writ, the purpose of which is to correct a
judgment in the same court in which it was ren-
dered, on the ground of error of fact. Washing-
ton v. State, 92 Fla. 740, 110 So. 259, 262; People v.
Black, 89 Cal.App. 225, 264 P. 346; for which the
statute provides no other remedy, which fact did
193 N.W. 978; or was unknown to the court when
judgment was pronounced, and which, if known,
would have prevented the judgment, and which
was unknown, and could not have been known to
the party by the exercise of reasonable diligence in
time to have been otherwise presented to the
court, unless he was prevented from so presenting
them by duress, fear, or other sufficient cause,
Nickels v. State, 86 Fla. 208, 98 So. 502, 504; Smul-
ski v. H. Feinberg Furniture Co., Del.Super., 193
A. 585, 587; as where judgment is rendered
against a party after his death, or an infant not
properly represented by guardian, or a feme
covert where common-law disability still exists, or
where some defect exists in the process or the ex-
ecution thereof. Schneider v. Schneider, Mo.App.,
273 S.W. 1081, 1083; 1 Saund. 101; Steph.P1.
*119; Day v. Hamburgh, 1 Browne, Pa. 75.
An ordinary "writ of error" is brought for a supposed
error in law apparent on the record, and takes the case to
a higher tribunal where the question is to be decided and
the judgment, sentence or decree is to be affirmed or re-
versed, while the "writ of error coram nobis" is brought
for an alleged error in fact not appearing on the record
and lies to the same court in order that it may correct the
error, which it is presumed would not have been committed
had the fact been brought to the court's notice in the first
instance. State v. Wagner, 232 Wis. 138, 286 N.W. 544, 545.
At common law in England, it issued from the Court of
King's Bench to a judgment of that court. Its principal
aim is to afford the court in which an action was tried
an opportunity to correct its own record with reference to
a vital fact not known when the judgment was rendered.
Lamb v. State, 91 Fla. 396, 107 So. 535, 537, 538; Rhodes
v. State, 199 Ind. 183, 156 N.E. 389, 392. It is also said that
at common law it lay to correct purely ministerial errors
of the officers of the court. Cramer v. Illinois Commercial
Men's Ass'n, 260 Ill. 516, 103 N.E. 459, 461.

## WRIT OF ERROR CORAM VOBIS

This writ,
at the English common law, is distinguished from
"writ of error coram nobis," in that the former is-
sued from the Court of King's Bench to a judg-
ment of the Court of Common Pleas, whereas the
latter issued from the Court of King's Bench to a
judgment of that court. Lamb v. State, 107 So.
535, 537, 91 Fla. 396.

ford & N. R. Co., 28 Conn. 70; McGowin v. Dick-
son, 182 Ala. 161, 62 So. 685, 688.
WRIT OF MAINPRIZE, or MAINPRISE. In

generally, when any man is imprisoned for a bail-
able offense and bail has been refused, or specially,
when the offense or cause of commitment is not

called "mainpernors," and to set him at large. 3
Bl.Comm. 128. See, also, Mainprise.

## WRIT OF MANDAMUS

and B., the tenant paravail. Co.Litt. 100a.

## WRIT OF POSSESSION

This is the writ of exe-
cution employed to enforce a judgment to recover

"Writ of Assistance," see that title.
WRIT OF PR1ECIPE. This writ is also called
a "writ of covenant," and is sued out by the party

foundation of which is a supposed agreement or
covenant that the one shall convey the land to
the other. 2 Bl.Comm. 349.

## WRIT OF PREVENTION

This name is given to
certain writs which may be issued in anticipation
of suits which may arise. Co.Litt. 100. See Quia
Timet.

## WRIT OF PROBABLE CAUSE

process designed to supersede enforcement of
judgment of trial court brought up for review.
Martin v. Rosen, 2 Cal.App.2d 450, 38 P.2d 855,
WRIT OF PROCESS. See Process; Action.

## WRIT OF PROCLAMATION

In English law.
By the statute 31 Eliz. c. 3, § 1, when an exigent
is sued out, a writ of proclamation shall issue at
the same time, commanding the sheriff of the
county where the defendant dwells to make three
proclamations thereof, in places the most notori-
ous, and most likely to come to his knowledge,
a month before the outlawry shall take place.
3 Bl.Comm. 284.
When it is not directed to the same sheriff as
the exigent is, it is called a foreign writ of proc-
lamation. 4 Reeve, Hist. Eng. Law 261.

## WRIT OF PROHIBITION

See Prohibition.

## WRIT OF PROTECTION

In England, the king
may, by his writ of protection, privilege any per-
during a year and a day; but this prerogative is
seldom, if ever, exercise. Archb.Pr. 687. See Co.
Litt. 130a.

## WRIT OF QUARE IMPEDIT

See Quare Im-
pedit.

## WRIT OF RECAPTION

If, pending an action of
replevin for a distress, the defendant distrains
again for the same rent or service, the owner of
the goods is not driven to another action of
replevin, but is allowed a writ of recaption, by
which he recovers the goods and damages for
the defendant's contempt of the process of the
law in making a second distress while the matter
is sub judice. Woodf. Landl. & Ten. 484.
WRIT OF REPLEVIN, See Replevin.

## WRIT OF RESTITUTION

A writ which is issued
on the reversal of a judgment commanding the
sheriff to restore to the defendant below the thing
levied upon, if it has not been sold, and, if it has

1349, 24 So. 325. In Code practice, a substitute for,

& 0. Land Co. v. Gowen, C.C.Or., 48 F. 775; Bur-
nett v. Douglas County, 4 Or. 389; In re Winegard,
78 Hun, 58, 28 N.Y.S. 1039.

## WRIT OF RIGHT

A writ which lay for one who
had the right of property, against another who
had the right of possession and the actual occupa-
tion. The writ properly lay only to recover cor-
poreal hereditaments for an estate in fee-simple;
but there were other writs, said to be "in the na-
ture of a writ of right," available for the recovery
of incorporeal hereditaments or of lands for a less
estate than a fee-simple. Brown; Fitzh. N. B. 1
(B) ; 3 Bl.Comm. 391.
"Originally a writ of right is so called because
it orders the feudal lord to do full right to the
demandant, plenum rectum tenere. . . But
when possessory actions have been established
in the king's court, 'right' is contrasted with `sei-
sin,' and all writs originating proprietary actions
for land . . . come to be known as writs of
right." Maitland, in 2 Sel.Essa;•s, Anglo-Am.Leg.
,
Hist. 563.
In another sense, a writ which is grantable as
a matter of right, as opposed to a "prerogative
writ," which is issued only as a matter of grace
or discretion.

## WRIT OF SUMMONS

the English judicature acts, all actions are com-
menced.

## WRIT OF SUPERVISORY CONTROL

A writ
which is issued only to correct erroneous rulings
made by the lower court within its jurisdiction,
where there is no appeal, or the remedy by appeal
cannot afford adequate relief, and gross injustice
is threatened as the result of such rulings. State
v. District Court of First Judicial Dist. in and for
Lewis and Clark County, 50 Mont. 428, 147 P. 612,
613. It is in nature of summary appeal to control
course of litigation in trial court when necessary
to prevent miscarriage of justice, and may be em-
ployed to prevent extended and needless litigation.
State ex rel. 'Regis v. District Court of Second Ju-
dicial Dist. in and for Silver Bow County, 102
Mont. 74, 55 P.2d 1295.
Function of "writ of supervisory control" is to enable
Supreme Court to control course of litigation in inferior
courts where such courts are proceeding within their ju-
risdiction, but by mistake of law, or willful disregard of it,
are doing gross injustice, and there is no appeal or remedy
by appeal is inadequate. State ex rel. State Bank of
Townsend v. District Court of First Judicial Dist. in and
for Lewis and Clark County, 94 Mont. 551, 25 P.2d 396.

## WRIT OF TOLT

In old English law. The name

patent from the court-baron into the county court.

## WRIT OF TRIAL

In English law. A writ direct-
ing an action brought in a superior court to be
tried in an inferior court or before the under-
sheriff, under St. 3 & 4 Wm. IV, c. 42. It is now
superseded by the county courts act of 1867, c. 142,
§ 6, by which a defendant, in certain cases, is en-
abled to obtain an order that the action be tried
in a county court. 3 Steph.Comm. 515, n.; Mozley
& Whitley.

## WRIT OF WASTE

The name of a writ to be is-
sued against a tenant who has committed waste
of the premises. There were anciently several
forms of this writ, adapted to the particular cir-
cumstances. Fitzh.Nat.Brev. 125.

manding the return of the goods to the defend-
ant, upon a judgment in his favor in replevin, upon
the plaintiff's default.

## WRITER OF THE TALLIES

ficer of the exchequer whose duty it was to write
upon the tallies the letters of tellers' bills.

## WRITER TO THE SIGNET

In Scotch law. An
officer nearly corresponding to an attorney at law,
in English and American practice. "Writers to
the signet," called also "clerks to the signet," de-
rive their name from the circumstance that they
were anciently clerks in the office of the secretary
of state, by whom writs were prepared and issued
under the royal signet or seal; and, when the
signet became employed in judicial proceedings,
they obtained a monopoly of the privileges of act-
ing as agents or attorneys before the court of ses-
sion. Brande, voc. "Signet."
WRITING. The expression of ideas by letters
visible to the eye. Clason v. Bailey, 14 Johns. (N.
Y.) 491. The giving an outward and objective
form to a contract, will, etc., by means of letters
or marks placed upon paper, parchment, or other
In the most general sense of the word, "writing"
denotes a document, whether manuscript or print-
ed, as opposed to mere spoken words. Writing
is essential to the validity of certain contracts
and other transactions. Sweet. See "Instrument."
WRITING OBLIGATORY. The technical name
by which a bond is described in pleading. Denton
v. Adams, 6 Vt. 40.

## WRITTEN CONTRACT

See Contract.

## WRITTEN INSTRUMENT

Something reduced
to writing as a means of evidence, and as the
means of giving formal expression to some act or
contract. Curlee Clothing Co. v. Lowery, Tex.Civ.
App., 275 S.W. 730, 732.

## WRITTEN LAW

One of the two leading divi-
sions of the Roman law, comprising the leges,
plebiscita, senatus-consulta, principum placita,
magistratuum edicta, and responsa prudentum.
Inst. 1, 2, 3.
Statute law. 1 Steph.Comm. 40. Law deriving
its force from express legislative enactment. 1
Bl.Comm. 62, 85.

## WRONG

A violation of the legal rights of an-
other; an invasion of right to the damage of the
parties who suffer it, especially a tort. State ex
rel. and to Use of Donelon v. Deuser, 345 Mo.
628, 134 S.W.2d 132, 133. It usually signifies in-
jury to person, property or relative noncontrac-
tual rights of another than wrongdoer, with or
without force, but, in more extended sense, in-
cludes violation of contract. Daurizio v. Mer-
chants' Despatch Transp. Co., 152 Misc. 716, 274
N.Y.S. 174.
The idea of rights naturally suggests the correlative one
of wrongs; for every right is capable of being violated. A
right to receive payment for goods sold (for example) im-
plies a wrong on the part of him who owes, but withholds
the price; a right to live in personal security, a wrong on
the part of him who commits personal violence. And
therefore, while, in a general point of view, the law is in-
tended for the establishment and maintenance of rights,
we find it, on closer examination, to be dealing both with
rights and wrongs. It first fixes the character and defini-
tion of rights, and then, with a view to their effectual se-
curity, proceeds to define wrongs, and to devise the means
by which the latter shall be prevented or redressed. 1
Steph.Comm. 126.
Private Wrong
