## KING

The sovereign, ruler, or chief executive
magistrate of a state or nation whose constitution
is of the kind called "monarchical" is thus named
if a man; if it be a woman, she is called "queen."
The word expresses the idea of one who rules singly
over a whole people or has the highest executive power;
but the office may be either hereditary or elective, and the
sovereignty of the king may or may not be absolute,
according to the constitution of the country.
See Emperor.

## KING CAN DO NO WRONG

This maxim means
that the king is not responsible legally for aught
he may please to do, or for any omission. Aust.
Jur. sect. VI.
It does not mean that everything done by the govern-
ment is just and lawful, but that whatever is exception-
able in the conduct of public affairs is not to be imputed
to the king, 2 Steph.Com., 11th ed. 486.

## KING-CRAFT

The art of governing.

## KINGDOM

A country where an officer called a
"king" exercises the powers of government, wheth-
er the same be absolute or limited. Wolff, Inst.
Nat. § 994. In some kingdoms, the executive of-
ficer may be a woman, who is called a "queen."
KING-GELD. A royal aid; an escuage (q. v.).

## KING'S ADVOCATE

An English advocate who
holds, in the courts in which the rules of the
canon and civil law prevail, a similar position to
that which the attorney general holds in the ordi-
nary courts, i. e., he acts as counsel for the crown
in ecclesiastical, admiralty, and probate cases, and
advises the crown on questions of international
law. In order of precedence it seems that he ranks
after the attorney general. 3 Steph. Comm. 275n.

## KINGS-AT-ARMS

The principal herald of Eng-
land was of old designated "king of the heralds,"
a title which seems to have been exchanged for
"king-at-arms" about the reign of Henry IV.
The kings-at-arms at present existing in England are
three—Garter, Clarencieux, and Norroy, besides Bath, who
Is not a member of the college. Scotland is placed under
an officer called "Lyon King-at-Arms," and Ireland is the
province of one named "Ulster." Wharton.

## KING'S BENCH

The supreme court of common
law in England, being so called because the king
used formerly to sit there in person, the style of
the court being "coram ipso rege."
It was called the "queen's bench" in the reign of a
queen, and during the protectorate of Cromwell it was
styled the "upper bench." It consisted of a chief justice
and three puisne justices, who were by their office the
sovereign conservators of the peace and supreme coroners
of the land. It was a remnant of the aula regis, and was
not originally fixed to any certain place, but might follow
the king's person, though for some centuries past it usu-
ally sat at Westminster. It had a very extended jurisdic-
tion both in criminal and civil causes; the former in
what was called the "crown side" or "crown office," the
latter in the "plea side," of the court. Its civil jurisdiction
was gradually enlarged until it embraced all species of
personal actions. Since the judicature acts, this court
constitutes the "king's bench division" of the "high court
KING'S CHAMBERS. Those portions of the seas,
adjacent to the coasts of Great Britain, which are
inclosed within headlands so as to be cut off from
the open sea by imaginary straight lines drawn
from one promontory to another.

## KING'S CORONER AND ATTORNEY

An of-
ficer of the court of king's bench, usually called
"the master of the crown office," whose duty it
is to file informations at the suit of a private sub-
ject by direction of the court. 4 Bl. Comm. 308,
309; 4 Steph. Comm. 374, 378.

## KING'S COUNSEL

Barristers or serjeants who
have been called within the bar and selected to
be the king's counsel. They answer in some meas-
ure to the advocati fisci, or advocates of the rev-
enue, among the Romans. They must not be em-
ployed against the crown without special leave,
which is, however, always granted, at a cost of
about nine pounds. 3 Bl. Comm. 27.

## KING'S EVIDENCE

When several persons are
charged with a crime, and one of them gives evi-
dence against his accomplices, on the promise of
being granted a pardon, he is said to be admitted
king's or (in America) state's evidence. 4 Steph.
Comm. 395; Sweet.

## KING'S PROCTOR

A proctor or solicitor repre-
senting the crown in the former practice of the
courts of probate and divorce.
In petitions for dissolution of marriage, or for declara-
tions of nullity of marriage, the king's proctor may, under
the direction of the attorney general, and by leave of the
court, intervene in the suit for the purpose of proving col-
lusion between the parties. Mozley & Whitley.

## KING'S REMEMBRANCER

An officer of the
central office of the English supreme court.
Formerly he was an officer of the exchequer, and had im-
portant duties to perform in protecting the rights of the
crown; e. g., by instituting proceedings for the recovery
of land by writs of intrusion, (q. v.,) and for the recovery
of legacy and succession duties; but of late years ad-
ministrative changes have lessened the duties of the office.
Sweet.
He was at the head of the department which had charge
of all revenue suits, and of matters pertaining to the office
of sheriff. He attended as the officer of the king's bench
when the lord mayor made his appearance on November
9th, and as representing the old court of exchequer when
the city of London did suit and service in discharge of
quit-rents for certain lands anciently held under the crown.
He presided at the Trial of the Pyx, the assaying and
weighing of the coins of the realm. See Remembrances of
Sir F. Pollock.

## KING'S SILVER

In old English practice. A fine
due the king pro licentia concordandi, (for leave

## KLEPTOMANIA

In medical jurisprudence. A
species (or symptom) of mania, consisting in an
irresistible propensity to steal. Looney v. State,
10 Tex.App. 525, 38 Am.Rep. 646; State v. Reidell,
9 Houst., Del., 470, 14 A. 550; Lowe v. State, 70
S.W. 206, 44 Tex.Cr.R. 224 (citing Hurst v. State,
40 Tex.Cr.R. 378, 46 S.W. 635, 50 S.W. 719).
It is said to be often shown in cases of women, laboring
under their peculiar diseases or of those far advanced in
pregnancy. A sharp distinction is made between kleptoma-
nia and the tendency to steal so commonly observed in the
well defined forms of insanity; the former is a defective
mental characteristic approaching the confines of insan-
ity on one subject alone, while the individual, on all other
subjects, is perfectly sane. It differs from shoplifting
in that the shoplifter steals for a purpose, and only those
articles which are of value, while the kleptomaniac takes
goods of any description, often of no use to herself and
with no motive for their possession; 4 Am.Lawy. 533.

## KNACKER

servant from tenants who were bound to grind
their grain at such mill.

resting on them is to kneel. 36 L.J.Ecc. 10.

## KNIGHT

In English law. The next personal
dignity after the nobility.
Of knights there are several orders and degrees. The first
in rank are knights of the Garter, instituted by Richard I.
and improved by Edward III. in 1344; next follows' a
knight banneret; then come knights of the Bath, institut-
ed by Henry IV., and revived by George I.; and they
were so called from a ceremony of bathing the night be-
fore their creation. The last order are knights bachelors,
who, though the lowest, are yet the most ancient, order
of knighthood; for we find that King Alfred conferred
this order upon his son Athelstan. 1 Bl.Comm. 403.

## KNIGHTENGUILD

An ancient guild or society
formed by King Edgar.

## KNIGHTHOOD

The rank, order, character, or
dignity of a knight.

## KNIGHT-MARSHAL

hold and verge, and of all contracts made therein,

most ancient, though lowest, order of knighthood.
1 Bl. Comm. 404.

## KNIGHTS BANNERET

the Garter. 1 Bl. Comm. 403.

## KNIGHT'S FEE

The determinate quantity of
land, (held by an estate of inheritance,) or of an-
nual income therefrom, which was sufficient to
maintain a knight.
In the time of Henry II. the estate was estimated at £20
a year; but Lord Coke in his time it to be an estate
of 680 acres. See 1 Bl.Comm. 404, 410; 2 Bl.Comm. 62;
Co.Litt. 69a; 1 Poll. & Malt'. 232.

## KNIGHTS OF ST

MICHAEL AND ST. GEORGE.
An English order of knighthood, instituted in 1818.

## KNIGHTS OF ST

PATRICK. Instituted in Ire-
land by George III., A. D. 1763. They have no
rank in England.

## KNIGHTS OF THE BATH

An order supposed to
have been instituted by Henry IV., and revived by
George I. in 1725 to consist of the sovereign, a
grand master and 36 knights companions. In
1815 the order was instituted in three classes. In
1847 the civil knights, commanders and compan-
ions were added. They are so called from the
ceremony formerly observed of bathing the night
before their creation.

## KNIGHTS OF THE CHAMBER

Those created in
the sovereign's chamber in time of peace, not in
the field. 2 Inst. 666.

## KNIGHTS OF THE GARTER

See Garter.

## KNIGHTS OF THE POST

A term for hireling
witnesses.

## KNIGHTS OF THE SHIRE

In English law.
Members of parliament representing counties .or
shires, in contradistinction to citizens or burgesses,
who represent boroughs or corporations.
A knight of the shire is so called, because, as the terms
of the writ for election still require, it was formerly neces-
sary that he should be a knight. This restriction was
coeval with the tenure of knight-service, when every man
who received a knight's fee immediately of the crown was
constrained to be a knight; but at present any person may
be chosen to fill the office who is not an alien. The money
qualification is abolished by 21 Vict. c. 26. Wharton.

## KNIGHTS OF THE THISTLE

A Scottish order
of knighthood.
This order is said to have been instituted by Achalus,
king of Scotland, A. D. 819. The better opinion, however,
is that it was instituted by James V. in 1534, was revived
by James VII. (James II. of England) in 1687, and reestab-
lished by Queen Anne in 1703. They have no rank in
England. Wharton.

## KNIGHT'S SERVICE

Upon the Norman con-
quest, all the lands in England were divided into
knight's fees, in number above sixty thousand.
For every knight's fee, a knight was bound to attend the
'king in his wars forty days in• a year, in which space of
time a campaign was generally finished. If a man only
held half a knight's fee, he was only bound to attend
twenty days; and so in proportion. But this personal
service, in process of time, grew into pecuniary commuta-
tions, or aids; until at last, with the military part of the
feudal system, it was abolished at the restoration, by the
statute of 12 Car. II. c. 24. 1 Bla.Com. 410; 2 id. 62;
Will. Real Pr. 144; 1 Poll. & Maitl. 230.

## KNOCK DOWN

To assign to a bidder at an auc-
tion by a knock or blow of the hammer.
Property is said to be "knocked down" when the auc-
tioneer, by the fall of his hammer, or by any other audible
or visible announcement, signifies to the bidder that he is
entitled to the property on paying the amount of his bid,
according to the terms of the sale. "Knocked down" and
"struck off" are synonymous terms. Sherwood v. Reade,
7 Hill, N.Y., 439.

## KNOT

In seamen's language, a "knot" is a divi-
sion of the log-line serving to measure the rate
of the vessel's motion.
The number of knots which run off from the reel in
half a minute shows the number of miles the vessel sails in
an hour. ' Hence when a ship goes 8 nautical miles an hour
she is said to go "8 knots." Webster.

"Knowledge" consists in the perception of the truth of
affirmative or negative propositions, while "belief" admits
of all degrees, from the slightest suspicion to the fullest
assurance. State v. Godette, 188 N.C. 497, 125 S.E. 24, 28;
Franken v. State, 190 Wis. 424, 209 N.W. 766, 769. The
difference between them is ordinarily merely in the degree,
to be judged of by the court, when addressed to the
court; by the jury, when addressed to the jury. Hatch
v. Carpenter, 9 Gray, Mass., 271. See Utley v. Hill, 155 Mo".
232, 55 S.W. 1091, 49 L.R.A. 323, 78 Am.St.Rep..569; Ohio
Valley Coffin Co. v. Goble, 28 Ind.App. 362, 62 N.E. 1025.
Knowledge may be imputed, when the means of knowl-
edge exists, known and accessible to the party, and capable
of communicating positive information. Smith v. Indus-
trial Acc. Commission of California, 174 Cal. 199, 162 P.
636, 637; Scheckells v. Ice Plant Mining Co., Mo.App.,
180 S.W. 12, 15; Hopkins v. McCarthy, 121 Me. 27, 115 A..
513, 515. However closely actual notice may, in many in-
stances, approximate knowledge, and constructive notice
may be its equivalent in effect, there may be actual notice
without knowledge; and, when constructive notice is
made the test to determine priorities of right, it may fall
far short of knowledge. Cleveland Woolen Mills v. Sibert,
21 Ala. 140, 1 So. 773; Dodge v. Grain Shippers' Mut. Fire
Ins. Ass'n, 176 Iowa 316, 157 N.W. 955, 961; Stanton v.
Hawkins, 41 R.I. 501, 103 A. 229, 230. Thus, oral notice to
employer by employe of injury is not "knowledge" of the
injury, excusing employe's failure to give notice of injury
required by Workmen's Compensation Act. In re Brown,
228 Mass. 31, 116 N.E. 897, 898; In re Simmons, 117 Me.
175, 103 A. 68.
"Knowledge" of contents of an instrument must include
understanding of its actual contents. Mitchell v. Slye, 137
Md. 89, 111 A. 814, 819.
Law regards as "knowledge" reckless misrepresentation,
with intent to deceive, about that which party pretended
to know but knew nothing. Holt v. Gloer, 44 Ga.App. 685,
162 S.E. 663, 664.
Carnal knowledge. See Carnal Knowledge.
Knowledge of another's peril. One has "knowl-
edge of peril of another," within doctrine of dis-
covered peril, whenever it reasonably appears
from the known facts and circumstances that the
latter is pursuing a course which will probably
terminate in serious bodily injury to him, and
that he probably will pursue it to the end. Gal-
veston, H. & S. A. Ry. Co. v. Wagner, Tex.Com.
App., 298 S.W. 552, 554.
Knowledge of law includes knowledge of the
decisions of the courts, which are part of the law.
Spitzer v. Board of Trustees for Regina Public
School Dist. No. 4, of Saskatchewan, C.C.A.Ohio,
267 F. 121, 126.
Personal knowledge. Knowledge of the truth in
regard to a particular fact or allegation, which
is original, and does not depend on information
or hearsay. Personal knowledge of an allegation
in an answer is personal knowledge of its truth
or falsity; and if the allegation is a negative one,
this necessarily includes a knowledge of the truth
or falsity of the allegation denied. West v. Home
Ins. Co., C.C.Or., 18 F. 622.

## KNOWN

derstood; especially, when used absolutely, famil-
iar to all; generally understood or perceived, and
term may, according to context, refer to both ac-
tual and constructive knowledge. Wolf v. Mallinc-

333; McCullough v. National Bank of Union City,
127 Pa.Super. 452, 193 A. 65, 66.

## KNOWN HEIRS

In a statute relating to the sale
of property of unknown heirs, it has been held to
mean those persons who are known, and whose
right to inherit, or the extent of whose right, to
inherit, is dependent on the non-existence of other
persons nearer or as near as the ancestor in the
line of descent. People v. Ryder, 65 Hun 175, 19
N.Y.S. 977.

## KNOWN-MEN
