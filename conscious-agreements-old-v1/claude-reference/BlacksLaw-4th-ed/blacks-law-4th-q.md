diction, even to pronouncing sentence, and then
was appointed periodically, and eventually be-

inal tribunal, and was then called "qucestio per-
petua." Maine, Anc. Law, 369-372.

as were connected with the republic by ties of public hos-
pitality. Lastly, they were charged with the care of the
burials and monuments of distinguished men, the expenses
for which had been decreed by the senate to be paid by the
treasury. Their number at first was confined to two ; but
this was afterwards increased as the empire became ex-
tended. There were quwstors of cities and of provinces,
and questors of the army ; the latter were in fact pay-
masters.

The possession by an indi-
vidual of the qualities, properties, or circumstanc-
es, natural or adventitious, which are inherently
or legally necessary to render him eligible to fill

Thus, the ownership of a freehold estate may be
made the qualification of a voter; so the posses-
sion of a certain amount of stock in a corporation

party is wanting, the provision of the law is at
hand. 6 Vin. Abr. 49; 13 C. B. 960.

## QUANDO ACCIDERINT

Lat. When they shall

In practice. When a defendant, executor, or ad-
ministrator pleads plene administravit, the plain-
tiff may pray to have judgment of assets quando
acciderint; Bull. N. P. 169; Bac. Abr. Executor
(M). A similar judgment may be taken at plain-
tiff's election, in an action against an heir, on a
plea of riens per descent, instead of taking issue
on the plea. In either of these cases if assets
afterwards come to the hands of the executor or
heir a scire facias must be sued out before exe-
cution can issue, or there may be an action of
debt, suggesting a devastavit; 2 Bouv. Inst. 3708.
It is also sometimes termed a judgment of assets
in futuro. By taking a judgment in this form the
plaintiff admits that defendant has fully admin-
istered to that time; 1 Pet. C. C. 442, n; and
therefore the plaintiff will not be allowed to give
evidence of effects come to defendant's hands be-
fore judgment. For this reason the scire facias
on a judgment of assets quando acciderint must
only pray execution of such assets as have come
to the defendant's hands since former judgment,
and if it prays judgment of assets generally, it
cannot be supported. 2 Com. Dig. Pleader (2D9).
QUANDO ALIQUID MANDATUR, MANDATUR
ET OMNE PER QUOD PERVENITUR AD IL-
LUD. 5 Coke 116. When anything is commanded,
everything by which it can be accomplished is
also commanded.
QUANDO ALIQUID PER SE NON SIT MALUM,

FACIENDUM. When anything by itself is not
evil, and yet may be an example for evil, it is
not to be done. 2 Inst. 564.

## QUANDO ALIQUID PROHIBETUR EX DIREC- TO, PROHIBETUR ET PER OBLIQUUM

Co.
Litt. 223. When anything is prohibited directly,
it is prohibited also indirectly.
ETUR ET OMNE PER QUOD DEVENITUR AD
ILLUD: When anything is prohibited, everything
by which it is reached is prohibited also. 2 Inst.
48. That which cannot be done directly shall not
be done indirectly. Broom, Max. 489.
QUANDO ALIQUIS ALIQUID CONCEDIT, CON-
CEDERE VIDETUR ET ID SINE QUO RES UTI
NON POTEST. When a person grants anything,
he is supposed to grant that also without which
the thing cannot be used. When the use of a
thing is granted, everything is granted by which
the grantee may have and enjoy such use. 3 Kent,
Comm. 421.
QUANDO CHARTA CONTINET GENERALEM

ERALI SUNT CONSENTANEA, INTERPRE-
TANDA EST CHARTA SECUNDUM VERBA

clause, and afterwards descends to special words
which are agreeable to the general clause, the
deed is to be interpreted according to the special
words. 8 Coke 154b.

ABILES EXISTUNT, UNUS, PRO INSUFFICIEN-
TIA ALTERIUS, DE .INTEGRO ONERABITUR.

same thing, one of them, in case of default of the
other, shall be charged with the whole. 2 Inst.
QUANDO DISPOSITIO REFERRI POTEST AD
DUAS RES ITA QUOD SECUNDUM RELA-
TIONEM UNAM VITIETUR ET SECUNDUM
ALTERAM UTILIS SIT, TUM FACIENDA EST
RELATIO AD ILLAM UT VALEAT DISPOSI-
TIO. 6 Coke 76. When a disposition may refer
to two things, so that by the former it would be
vitiated, and by the latter it would be preserved,
then the relation is to be made to the latter, so
that the disposition may be valid.
QUANDO DIVERS! DESIDERANTUR ACTUS
AD ALIQUEM STATUM PERFICIENDUM, PLUS
RESPICIT LEX ACTUM ORIGINALEM. When
different acts are required to the formation of any
estate, the law chiefly regards the original act.
When to the perfection of an estate or interest
divers acts or things are requisite, the law has
more regard to the original act, for that is the
fundamental part on which all the others are
founded. 10 Coke 49a.
QUANDO DUO JURA CONCURRUNT IN UNA
PERSONA, JEQUUM EST AC SI ESSENT IN
DIVERSIS. When two rights concur in one per-
son, it is the same as if they were in two sep-
arate persons. 4 Co. 118; Broom, Max. 531.

LIGENDA. When a law is special, but its reason
[or object] general, the law is to be understood
generally. 2 Inst. 83.

## QUANDO LICET ID QUOD MAJUS, VIDETUR ET LICERE ID QUOD MINUS

Shep. Touch.
429. When the greater is allowed, the less is to
be understood as allowed also.
QUANDO IVIULIER NOBILIS NUPSERIT IGNO-
BILI, DESINIT ESSE NOBILIS NISI NOBILI-
TAS NATIVA FUERIT. 4 Coke, 118. When a
noble woman marries a man not noble, she ceases
to be noble, unless her nobility was born with her.
QUANDO PLUS FIT QUAM FIERI DEBET, VI-
DETUR ETIAM ILLUD FIERI QUOD FACIEN-
DUM EST. When more is done than ought to be
done, that at least shall be considered as per-
formed which should have been performed, [as,

inson v. Pebworth, 71 Ala. 240. It is to be noted that in
the cases grouped under this title the courts have generally

gested, is a questionable use of terms, since many of the
cases are mere instances of ratification or acquiescence;
Big. Est. 755.
"Equitable estoppel" and "estoppel in pals" are con-
vertible terms embracing "quasi estoppel" and embody
doctrine that one may not repudiate an act done or position
assumed by him, where such course would work injustice

## QUIRITARIAN OWNERSHIP

In Roman law.
Ownership held by a title recognized by the mu-
nicipal law, in an object also recognized by that
law, and in the strict character of a Roman citi-
zen. "Roman law originally only recognized one
kind of dominion, called, emphatically, `quiritary
dominion.' Gradually, however, certain real rights
arose which, though they failed to satisfy all the
elements of the definition of quiritary dominion,
were practically its equivalent, and received from
the courts a similar protection. These real rights
might fall short of quiritary dominion in three re-
spects: (1) Either in respect of the persons in
whom they resided; (2) or of the subjects to
which they related; or (3) of the title by which
they were acquired." In the latter case, the own-
ership was called "bonitarian," e., "the property
of a Roman citizen, in a subject capable of quiri-
tary property, acquired by a title not known to
the civil law, but introduced by the praetor and
protected by his imperium or supreme executive
power;" e. g., where res mancipi had been trans-
ferred by mere tradition. Poste's Gaius' Inst. 186.

writ, in the nature of a writ of right for the king,

franchise, or liberty, to inquire by what authority
he supported his claim, in order to determine the
right. It lay also in case of non-user, or long
neglect of a franchise, or misuser or abuse of it;
being a writ commanding the defendant to show
by what warrant he exercises such a franchise,
having never had any grant of it, or having for-
feited it by neglect or abuse. 3 Bl.Comm. 262.
In England, and quite generally throughout the
United States, this writ has given place to an "in-
formation in the nature of a quo warranto,"
which, though in form a criminal proceeding, is
in effect a civil remedy similar to the old writ,
and is the method now usually employed for try-
ing the title to a corporate or other franchise, or
to a public or corporate office. Ames v. Kansas,
111 U.S. 449, 4 S.Ct. 437, 28 L.Ed. 482; People v.

erally, to keep the peace, but provides that some
particular named justices or one of them shall al-
ways be present when business is to be transact-
ed, the ancient Latin phrase being "quorum unum
A. B. esse volumus." These designated persons
are the "justices of the quorum." But the dis-
tinction is long since obsolete. 1 Bl.Comm. 351;
Snider v. Rinehart, 18 Colo. 18, 31 P. 716.
