es, furies, and heath. Co. Litt. 4a; Reynard v.
City of Caldwell, 55 Idaho 342, 42 P.2d 292, 296;

quantity and character of the interest or estate
which the tenant may own in land. Holmes v.

Plowd. 555.
Technically land signifies everything which may
be holden; and the term is defined as compre-
hending all things of a permanent and substantial

subject of ownership and not the ownership. Sou-
thern Pac. Co. v. Riverside County, 35 Cal.App.2d

ever may be the ingredients of which it is composed,
whether soil, rock, or other substance. Civ.Code Cal. §
659; Reynard v. City of Caldwell, 55 Idaho 342, 42 P.2d 292,
Philosophically, it seems more correct to say that the
word "land" means, in law, as in the vernacular, the soil,
or portion of the earth's crust; and to explain or justify
such expressions as that "whoever owns the land owns
the buildings above and the minerals below," upon the
view, not that these are within the extension of the term
"land," but that they are so connected with it that by
rules of law they pass by a conveyance of the land. This
view makes "land," as a term, narrower in signification
than "realty ;" though it would allow an instrument speak-
ing of land to operate co-extensively with one granting
realty or real property by either of those terms. But many
of the authorities use the expression "land" as including
these incidents to the soil. Abbott.
The term "land" may be used interchangeably with
"property ;" it may include anything that may be classed
as real estate or real property. Reynard v. City of Cald-
well, 55 Idaho 342, 42 P.2d 292, 297.
The term "lands" designates all real estate. Enzor v.
State, 167 So. 336, 338, 27 Ala.App. 60.
The word "lands" is ordinarily synonymous with "real
estate" or "real property". Lincoln Nat. Bank & Trust
Co. of Fort Wayne v. Nathan, 215 Ind. 178, 19 N.E.2d 243.
247; Southern Pac. Co. v. Riverside County, 35 Cal.App.2d

An obligation of govern-
ment entitling owner to secure designated quan-

State v. Balli, Tex.Civ.App., 173 S.W.2d 522, 538.
Upon the registration of freehold land under the English
land transfer act, 1875, a certificate is given to the reg-
istered r-onrietor. and similarly upon every transfer of
registered land. This registration supersedes the necessity

is prima facie evidence of the truth of the matters therein
set forth.

## LAND COP

The sale of land which was evi-
denced in early English law by the transfer of a
rod or festuca (q. v.) as a symbol of possession
which was handed by the seller to the reeve and

better evidence of it, and barring the claims of ex-
pectant heirs; Maitl. Domesd. B. 323.

erly existing in St. Louis, Mo., having a limited ter-

## LAND REVENUES

This term denotes income
derived from crown lands in Great Britain.
These lands have been so largely granted away to sub-
jects that they are now contracted within very narrow
limits. The crown was so much improverished in this
manner by William III, that the stat. 1 Anne, c. 7, § 5, was
passed, which, with stat. 34 George III, c. 75, which
amends and continues it, makes void all grants or leases
from the ground of royal manors or other possessions con-
nected with land for a period exceeding thirty-one years,
or three lives. Long prior to this a Scottish stat. 1445, c.
41, had made necessary the consent of parliament in case
of the alienation of crown property. It is said that none of
these statutes have succeeded in checking the practice.
Early at the beginning of the reign of George III. the
hereditary crown revenues derived from escheats, manors
held in capite, estrays, fines, etc., were surrendered by
the king to the general funds, and in the place of them
he received a specified sum annually for the civil list.

280, 282.

sion of land; otherwise styled the "terre-tenant."
LAND TITLES AND TRANSFER ACT. An Eng-
lish statute (38 & 39 Vict. c. 87) providing for the
establishment of a registry for titles to real prop-
erty, and making sundry provisions for the trans-
fer of lands and the recording of the evidences
thereof. It presents some analogies to the record-
ing laws of the American states.

## LAND WAITER

In English law. An officer of
the customhouse, whose duty is, upon landing any
merchandise, to examine, taste, weigh, or measure
it, and to take an account thereof.
In some ports they also execute the office of a coast
waiter. They are likewise occasionally styled "searchers"
and are to attend and join with the patent searcher in the
execution of all cockets for the shipping of goods to be ex-
ported to foreign parts; and, in cases where drawbacks
on bounties are to be paid to the merchant on the exporta-
tion of any goods, they, as well as the patent searchers,
are to certify the shipping thereof on the debentures. Enc.
Lond.

or popular phrase to denote real property. Landed
estate ordinarily means an interest in and pertain-
ing to lands. Police Jury of Parish of St. Mary v.
Harris, 10 La.Ann. 676.
In a tax law it "clearly embraces not only the land, but
all houses, fixtures, and improvements of every kind there-
on, and all machinery, neat cattle, horses, and mules,
when attached to and used on a plantation or farm." A.
person holding such an estate is termed a landed proprie-
tor. 10 La.Ann. 676. A devise of "all my landed proper-
ty" carries the fee; Fogg v. Clark, 1 N.H. 163; and so
does "my landed estate"; Bradstreet v. Clarke, 12 Wend.,
N.Y., 602.
Real estate in general, or sometimes, by local usage,
suburban or rural land, as distinguished from real estate
situated in a city. See Electric Co. v. Baltimore, 93 Md.
630, 49 A..655, 52 L.R.A. 772; Sindall v. Baltimore, 93 Md.
526, 49 A. 645.

## LANDED ESTATES COURT

In English law.
Tribunals established by statute for the purpose
of disposing more promptly and easily than could
be done through the ordinary judicial machinery,
of incumbered real estate.
These courts were first established in Ireland by the act
of 11 & 12 Vict. c. 48, which being defective was followed
by 12 & 13 Vict. c. 77. The purpose of these was to enable
the owner, or a lessee for any less than 63 years unexpired,
of land subject to incumbrance, to apply to commissioners
who constituted a court of record to direct a sale. This
court was called the Incumbered Estates Court. A new
tribunal called the Landed Estates Court was created by
21 & 22 Vict. c. 72, which abolished the former court and
established a permanent tribunal.

False Pretense and Larceny Distinguished
See False Pretenses.
Grand Larceny
In criminal law. In England, simple larceny,
was originally divided into two sorts,—grand lar-
ceny, where the value of the goods stolen was
above twelve pence, and petit larceny, where their
value was equal to or below that sum. 4 Bl.
Comm. 229.
The distinction was abolished in England by St. 7 &
Geo. IV. c. 29, and is not generally recognized in the
United States, although in a few states there is a statutory
offense of grand larceny, one essential element of which
is the value of the goods stolen, which value varies. See
State v. Bean, 74 Vt. 111, 52 A. 269; People v. Murray, 8
Cal. 520; State v. Kennedy, 88 Mo. 343.
Larceny by Bailee

committed where any person, being a bailee of any
property, shall fraudulently take or convert the
same to his own use, or to the use of any other
person except the owner thereof, although he shall
not break bulk or otherwise determine the bail-
ment. Brightly's Purd. Dig. p. 436, § 177 (18 P.S.
§ 4816). And see Welsh v. People, 17 Ill. 339;
State v. Skinner, 29 Or. 599, 46 P. 368.
Larceny from the Person
Act of taking property from the person by mere-
ly lifting it from the person or pocket. State v.
Stanton, Mo., 68 S.W.2d 811, 812.
Larceny committed where the property stolen is on the
person or in the immediate charge or custody of the per-
son from whom the theft is made, but without such cir-
cumstances of force or violence as would ccnstitute rob-
bery, including pocket-picking and such crimes. Williams
v. U. S., 3 App.D.C. 345; State v. Eno, 8 Minn. 220, Gil.
Mixed Larceny
Otherwise called "compound" or "complicated
larceny;" that which is attended with circum-

a certain arbitrary standard, at common law
twelve pence. See Ex parte Bell, 19 Fla. 612;

a code of laws, more fully described as "Las Siete
Partidas," ("the seven parts," from the number
of its divisions,) which was compiled under the
direction of Alphonso X., about the year 1250.
Its sources were the customary law of all the provinces,
the canon law as there administered, and (chiefly) the Ro-
man law. This work has always been regarded as of the
highest authority in Spain and in those countries and states
which have derived their jurisprudence from Spain.

ly required by the intent and meaning of the con-
text, or disclosed by an examination of the entire

137 N.E. 859, 861; Nebraska State Ry. Commission
v. Alfalfa Butter Co., 104 Neb. 797, 178 N.W. 766,
768; Wisconsin Power & Light Co. v. Public Serv-
ice Commission of Wisconsin, 224 Wis. 286, 272
N.W. 50, 52.

## LAST CLEAR CHANCE

The "last clear chance
doctrine" is that a party who has last clear chance
to avoid damage or injury to another is liable.
Johnston v. Brewer, 40 Cal.App.2d 583, 105 P.2d
365, 367; Miami Beach Ry. Co. v. Dohme, 131 Fla.
171, 179 So. 166, 169; Virginia Electric & Power
Co. v. Whitehurst, 175 Va. 339, 8 S.E.2d 296, 299;
that negligence of party having last opportunity
of avoiding accident is sole proximate cause of in-
jury, Malfetano v. United Electric Rys. Co., 58 R.I.
129, 191 A. 491, 498; Gregory v. Maine Cent. R.
Co., 317 Miss. 636, 59 N.E.2d 471, 476, 159 A.L.R.
714; that if one has opportunity of avoiding in-
j uring another he must at his peril exercise the
opportunity. Ferran v. Southern Pac. Co., 3 Cal.
2d 350, 44 P.2d 533, 534. It places liability upon
him who commits the last proximate negligent
act. Davis v. Cuesta, 146 Fla. 471, 1 So.2d 475, 476.
The doctrine is inapplicable unless injured party was
guilty of negligence, Yellow Cab Corporation of Abingdon
v. Henderson, 178 Va. 207, 16 S.E.2d 389, 393; Washam v.
Peerless Automatic Staple Mach. Co., 45 Cal.App.2d 174,
113 P.2d 724, 728; and unless injured person is in an ap-
parently helpless condition, Battle v. Southern Ry. Co.,
223 N.C. 395, 26 S.E.2d 859.
The doctrine means that an injured party may recover,
notwithstanding negligence: if defendant could have avoid-
ed injury after discovering or knowing of peril, Sprinkle v.
Davis, C.C.A.Va., 111 F.2d 925, 928, 128 A.L.R. 1101; Wed-
dle v. Virginian Ry. Co., 125 W.Va. 41, 22 S.E.2d 698, 701;
Jones v. Yuma Motor Freight Terminal, 45 Cal.App.2d 497,
114 P.2d 438, 439, 440; Shea v. Pilette, 108 Vt. 446, 189 A.
154, 158, 109 A.L.R. 933, Stelter v. Northern Pac. Ry. Co.,
71 N.D. 214, 299 N.W. 310, 313, 314; if injuring party, see-
ing or knowing or aware of peril, fails to use ordinary or
110 Cal.App. 221, 293 P. 861, 864; Groves v. Webster City,
222 Iowa 849, 270 N.W. 329, 332; Caplan v. Arndt, 123
Conn. 585, 196 A. 631, 633, 119 A.L.R. 1037; Kurn v. Mc-
Coy, 187 Okl. 210, 102 P.2d 177; if injury might have been
avoided by exercise of reasonable care by defendant, Har-
stick v. Beckenhauer, 143 Neb. 179, 8 N.W.2d 834, 837;
General Exchange Ins. Corporation v. Carp, La.App., 176
So. 145, 147; Kelley Furniture Co. v. Washington Ry. &
Electric Co., 64 App.D.C. 215, 76 F.2d 985; Srogi v. New
York Cent. R. Co., 247 App.Div. 95, 286 N.Y.S. 215; Mullins
v. Cincinnati, N. & C. Ry. Co., 253 Ky. 156,.68 S.W.2d 790;
Lovett v. Sandersville R. Co., 72 Ga.App. 692, 34 S.E.2d
664, 666; if, with knowledge of peril to plaintiff or plain-
tiff's property, another acts or omits to act and injury re-
sults, Parsons v. Berry, 130 Neb. 264, 264 N.W. 742, 744.
The doctrine implies thought, appreciation, mental di-
rection, and a lapse of sufficient time to effectually act up-
on impulse to save another from injury, Colwell v. Ny-
gaard, 8 Wash.2d 462, 112 P.2d 838, 845; Merchants'
Transp. Co. v. Daniel, 109 Fla. 496, 149 So. 401, 403; or
proof of circumstances which will put the one charged on
implied notice of the situation, Schoen v. Western Union
Telegraph Co., C.C.A.Fla., 135 F.2d 967, 968.
The doctrine imposes duty upon a party to exercise
ordinary care in avoiding injury to another who has neg-
ligently placed himself in a situation of danger, Morris v.
Seashore Transp. Co., 208 N.C. 807, 182 S.E. 487, duty to
act when helpless peril is known and duty to exercise
vigilance to discover helpless peril, if duty of vigilance
exists toward class of which one in peril is member,
Leinbach v. Pickwick Greyhound Lines, 138 Kan. 50, 23 P.
2d 449, 92 A.L.R. 1.
The doctrine is limited, according to some decisions, to
cases in which defendant actually discovered person in-
jured and his peril. Walker v. East St. Louis & Suburban
Ry. Co., C.C.A.Mo., 25 F.2d 579, 580, Gauthier v. Foote, La.
App., 12 So.2d 9, 11; or in which defendant had actual
knowledge of plaintiff's peril or inability to extricate him-
self. Sarkise v. Boston & M. R. R., 88 N.H. 178, 186 A.
332, 334. But other decisions hold that the doctrine applies
if defendant, aware of plaintiff's peril or unaware of it only
through carelessness, has later opportunity than plaintiff to
avert the accident, Cheek v. Thompson, D.C.La., 28 F.
Supp. 391, 394; Linde Air Products Co. v. Cameron, C.C.A.
W.Va., 82 F.2d 22, 24; or if defendant knew or could or
should have known of peril, Arthur v. Rose, 289 Ky. 402,
158 S.W.2d 652, 653, 654; Ward v. City Fuel Oil Co., 147
Fla. 320, 2 So.2d 586, 587; Smith v. Pacific Greyhound Cor-
poration, 139 Cal.App. 696, 35 P.2d 169, 172; or if defend-
ant saw or discovered or should have seen or discovered
the danger, Young v. Thompson, La.App., 189 So. 487, 489,
490, 491; Hartman v. Dyer, 298 Ky. 173, 182 S.W.2d 646,
647; Evansville Container Corporation v. McDonald, C.C.A.
Tenn., 132 F.2d 80, 85; Harry v. Thompson, Mo.App., 166
S.W.2d 795, 798; or if injuring party was aware of peril
or by reasonable care should have known of danger, Gard-
ini v. Arakelian, 18 Cal.App.2d 424, 64 P.2d 181, 184; or if
peril is realized by defendant or through culpable careless-
ness he is oblivious to it, Pedigo v. Osborne, 279 Ky. 85, 129
S.W.2d 996, 999; Johnson v. Southwestern Engineering
Co., 41 Cal.App.2d 623, 107 P.2d 417, 418.
The doctrine is predicated, according to some decisions,
upon the theory that negligence of injured party has
ceased. Baltimore & 0. R. Co. v. Joseph, C.C.A.Ohio, 112
F.2d 518, 521, 522; Cohen v. Smith, 26 Ohio App. 32, 159 N.
E. 329, 333; Claggett v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 150 Kan.
191, 92 P.2d 52, 57; Becker v. Blum, 142 Fla. 60, 194 So.
275, 276.
Other decisions hold that, although plaintiff's negligence
continued until accident he may recover if the defendant,
after knowing of plaintiff's danger, or by exercise of ordi-
nary care could have known, could have avoided injury
by ordinary care, McLeod v. Charleston Laundry Co., 106
W.Va. 361, 145 S.E. 756, 757; Newbern v. Leary, 215 N.C.
134, 1 S.E.2d 384, 389, 393; Young v. Thompson, La.App.,
189 So. 487, 489, 490, 491; that the doctrine applies where
plaintiff's negligence continues up to time of injury, if
defendant actually sees the peril, or if plaintiff's negli-
gence has terminated and defendant should have seen it.
Chadwick v. Ek, .1 Wash.2d 117, 95 P.2d 398, 404; that the
doctrine applies where negligence of defendant with actual
knowledge of situation stands over against continuing neg-
ligence of plaintiff without actual knowledge of situation,
but not where plaintiff's negligence with knowledge of
situation stands over against defendant's negligence also
with such knowledge, Iverson v. Knorr, 68 S.D. 23, 298 N.
W. 28, 31.
The doctrine is sometimes designated as the humanitari-
an doctrine, Blashfield's Cyc. of Automobile Law and Prac.,
Perm. Ed., § 2841; Gilbert v. Mississippi River & B. T. R.
Co., Mo.App., 226 S.W. 263, 264; Iglesias v. Campbell, La.
App., 175 So. 145, 147; and also the doctrine of discovered
peril, Missouri Pac. R. Co. v. Skipper, 174 Ark. 1083, 298
S.W. 849, 854; Hines v. Foreman, Tex.Civ.App., 229 S.W.
630, 635; Soards v. Shreveport Rys. Co., La.App., 8 So.2d
343, 344. In Maryland, it is equivalent to "negligence in
the third degree." State v. New York, P. & N. R. Co.,
127 Md. 651. 96 A. 809, 811. The term "last fair chance"
is synonymous. Nagel v. Bretthauer, 230 Iowa 707, 298 N.
W. 852, 854.

Hazelton, 20 Johns., N.Y., 513, 11 Am.Dec. 307.

## LAST WILL

This term, according to Lord Coke,
is most commonly used where lands and tene-
ments are devised, and "testament" where it con-
cerns chattels. Co. Litt. 111a. Both terms, how-
ever, are now generally employed in drawing a
will either of lands or chattels. See Reagan v.
Stanley, 11 Lea, Tenn., 322; Hill v. Hill, 7 Wash.
409, 35 P. 360.
The common usage the world over is to employ the
words "will," "testament," and "last will and testament"
as exactly synonymous. Occidental Life Ins. Co. v. Pow-
ers, 192 Wash. 475, 74 P.2d 27, 32, 114 A.L.R. 531.

## LASTAGE

There are three sorts of law Latin : (1) Good Latin, al-

manumission, or manumitted otherwise than by vindicta,
census, or testamentum, or not the quiritary property of
their manumissors at the time of manumission, were called
"Latini." By reason of one or other of these three de-
fects, they remained slaves by strict law even after their
manumission, but were protected in their liberties first by
equity, and eventually by the Lex Junia Norbana, A. D.
19, from which law they took the name of "Juniani" in ad-
dition to that of "Latini." Brown.

## LAW

That which is laid down, ordained, or es-
tablished. A rule or method according to which
phenomena or actions co-exist or follow each oth-
er. That which must be obeyed and followed by
citizens, subject to sanctions or legal consequences,
is a "law." Koenig v. Flynn, 258 N.Y. 292, 179 N.
E. 705.
In old English jurisprudence, "law" is used to
signify an oath, or the privilege of being sworn;
as in the, phrases "to wage one's law," "to lose
one's law."
The term is also used in opposition to "fact."
Thus questions of law are to be decided by the
court, while it is the province of the jury to solve
questions of fact.
The earliest notion of law was not an enumeration of a
principle, but a judgment in a particular case. When pro-
nounced in the early ages, by a king, it was assumed to
be the result of direct divine inspiration. Afterwards came
the notion of a custom which a judgment affirms, or pun-
ishes its breach. In the outset, however, the only au-
thoritative statement of right and wrong is a judicial sen-
tence rendered after the fact has occurred. It does not
presuppose a law to have been violated, but is enacted for
the first time by a higher form into the judge's mind at the
moment of adjudication. Maine, Anc.Law, (Dwight's Ed.)
pp. xv, 5.

When a statute is passed in violation of law, that is, of
the fundamental law or constitution of a state, it is the
prerogative of courts to declare it void, or, in other words,
to declare it not to be law. Burrill.
When the term "law" is used to denote enactments of
the legislative power, it is frequently confined, especially
by English writers, to permanent rules of civil conduct, as
distinguished from other acts, such as a divorce act, an
appropriation bill, an estates act. Rep.Eng.St.L.Com.Mar.
With reference to its origin, "law" is derived either from
judicial precedents, from legislation, or from custom.

T. & S. F. Ry. Co. v. Railroad Commission of Cali-

The doctrine has reference to decisions on legal questions
and principles of law announced. Haynes Drilling Co. v.
Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co., 185 Okl. 122, 90 P.2d
639, 640; and does not embrace questions of fact or deci-

App. 87, 261 P. 754, 755. (But see holding that the de-
cision of appellate court on facts proved becomes "law
of the case". Cauldwell-Wingate Co. v. State, Ct.C1., 31
N.Y.S.2d 211, 213).
The doctrine includes all errors relied on for reversal,
whether mentioned in court's opinion or not, and all errors
lurking in record on first appeal, which might have been,
but were not, expressly relied on, Sowders v. Coleman,
223 Ky. 633, 4 S.W.2d 731, (but see holding that doctrine
does not extend to facts or points of law which might have
been but were not presented and determined on prior

634, 160 P.2d 804, 809) ; all matters, issues or questions

identical proceeding or on same or substantially identical
facts or identical question, In re Norman's Estate, 161 Or.
450, 88 P.2d 977, 987.
The doctrine is generally deemed applicable whether
former determination is right or wrong. Wells v. Lloyd,
21 Ca1.2d 452, 132 P.2d 471, 474. But some cases hold
that doctrine is inapplicable where prior decision is
unsound, Standard Oil Co. of California v. Johnson, 56 Cal.
App.2d 411, 132 P.2d 910, 913; Atchison T. & S. F. Ry. Co.
principles were announced or mistake of fact was made on

stantially, Chicago, St. P., M. & 0. Ry. Co. v. Kulp, C.C.A.

trial call for different judgment, Maze v. Bennett, 117
W.Va. 165, 184 S.E. 564, 565; there has been a material
change in record, Reynolds v. Virginian Ry. Co., 117 W.Va.
359, 185 S.E. 568, 569; there has been a substantial change
in issues or evidence, Royal Collieries Co. v. Wells, 244
Ky. 303, 50 S.W.2d 948, 949.
It may be invoked where evidence or facts on subsequent

## LAW OF THE FLAG

See Flag, Law of.

## LAW OF THE LAND

Due process of law (q. v.).
By the law of the land is most clearly intended
the general law which hears before it condemns,
which proceeds upon inquiry, and renders judg-
ment only after trial. Dupuy v. Tedora, 204 La.
560, 15 So.2d 886, 891. The meaning is that every
citizen shall hold his life, liberty, property, and
immunities under the protection of general rules
shore, 334 Pa. 449, 7 A.2d 302, 316; In re Stobie's
Estate, 30 Cal.App.2d 525, 86 P.2d 883, 885.
Everything which may pass under the form of an enact-
ment is not the law of the land. Sedg.St. & Const.Law,
(2d Ed.) 475. When first used in Magna Charta, the phrase
probably meant the established law of the kingdom, in
opposition to the civil or Roman law. It is now generally
regarded as meaning general public laws binding on all
members of the community. Janes v. Reynolds, 2 Tex. 251;
Beasley v. Cunningham, 171 Tenn. 334, 103 S.W.2d 18, 20,
110 A.L.R. 306. It means due process of law warranted by
the constitution, by the common law adopted by the con-
stitution, or by statutes passed in pursuance of the con-
stitution. Mayo v. Wilson, 1 N.H. 53.

## LAW WORTHY

Being entitled to, or having the
benefit and protection of, the law.

## LAWFUL

Legal; warranted or authorized by
the law; having the qualifications prescribed by
law; not contrary to nor forbidden by the law.
Ohio Automatic Sprinkler Co. v. Fender, 108 Ohio
St. 149, 141 N.E. 269, 275; McDonnell v. Murnan
Shipbuilding Corporation, 210 Ala. 611, 98 So. 887,
889; Hafner Mfg. Co. v. City of St. Louis, 262 Mo.
621, 172 S.W. 28, 33.
The principal distinction between the terms "lawful"
and "legal" is that the former contemplates the substance
of law, the latter the form of law. To say of an act that
it is "lawful" implies that it is authorized, sanctioned, or
at any rate not forbidden, by law. To say that it is
"legal" implies that it is done or performed in accordance
with the forms and usages of law, or in a technical man-
ner. In this sense "illegal" approaches the meaning of
"invalid." For example, a contract or will, executed with-
out the required formalities, might be said to be invalid or
illegal, but could not be described as unlawful. Further,
the word "lawful" more clearly implies an ethical content
than does "legal." The latter goes no further than to
denote compliance, with positive, technical, or formal
rules; while the former usually imports a moral substance
or ethical permissibility. A further distinction is that the
word "legal" is used as the synonym of "constructive,"
which "lawful" is not. Thus "legal fraud" is fraud im-
plied or inferred by law, or made out by construction.
"Lawful fraud" would be a contradiction of terms. Again,
"legal" is used as the antithesis of "equitable." Thus, we
speak of "legal assets," "legal estate," etc., but not of
"lawful assets," or "lawful estate." But there are some
connections in which the two words are used as exact
equivalents. Thus, a "lawful" writ, warrant, or process
is the same as a "legal" writ, warrant, or process.

## LEAD

The counsel on either side of a litigated ac-
tion who is charged with the principal management
and direction of the party's case, as distinguished
from his juniors or subordinates, is said to "lead in
the cause," and is termed the "leading counsel" on
that side.

## LEADING A USE

Where a deed was executed be-
fore the levy of a fine of land, for the purpose of
specifying to whose use the fine should inure, it
was said to "lead" the use. If executed after the
fine, it was said to "declare" the use. 2 Bl.Comm.

## LEADING CASE

Among the various cases that
are argued and determined in the courts, some,
from their important character, have demanded
more than usual attention from the judges, and
from this circumstance are frequently looked upon
as having settled or determined the law upon all
points involved in such cases, and as guides for
subsequent decisions, and from the importance
they thus acquire are familiarly termed "leading
cases." Brown.

## LEADING COUNSEL

That one of two or more
counsel employed on the same side in a cause who
has the principal management of the cause.

## LEADING QUESTION

One which instructs wit-
ness how to answer or puts into his mouth words
to be echoed back, People v. Hamilton, Gen.Sess.,
30 N.Y.S.2d 155, 158; one which suggests to wit-
ness answer desired. Little v. State, 79 Okl.Cr.
285, 154 P.2d 772, 777; State v. Scott, 20 Wash.
2d 696, 149 P.2d 152, 153, 154; Landers v. State,
118 Tex.Cr.R. 608, 39 S.W.2d 43, 44.
Questions are leading which suggest to the witness the
answer desired, or which embody a material fact, and may
be answered by a mere negative or affirmative, or which
involve an answer bearing immediately upon the merits of
the cause, and indicating to the witness a representation
which will best accord with the interests of the party pro-
pounding them. Turney v. State, 8 Smedes & M., Miss.,
104, 47 Am.Dec. 74.
A question is leading which puts into a witness' mouth
the words that are to be echoed back, or plainly suggests
the answer which the party wishes to get from him. Peo-
ple v. Mather, 4 Wend., N.Y., 229, 247, 21 Am.Dec. 122.
That question may be answered either yes or no does
not necessarily make it leading, Foster v. Sol Greisler &
Sons, 150 Pa.Super. 509, 29 A.2d 103, 106; Osterloh v. San
Antonio Public Service Co., Tex.Civ.App., 77 S.W.2d 290,
LEAGUE. 1. A treaty of alliance between dif-
ferent states or parties.
2. A measure of distance, varying in different
countries.
It may be offensive or defensive, or both. It is offensive
when the contracting parties agree to unite in attacking a
common enemy; defensive when the parties agree to act
in concert in defending each other against an enemy.
Wharton.
The marine league, marking the limit of national juris-
diction on the high seas, is equal to three geographical (or
marine) miles of 6,075 feet each.
In Spanish and Mexican law, the league, as a legal meas-
ure of length, consisted of 5,000 varas, and a vara was
equivalent to 33% English inches, making the league equal
to a little more than 2.63 miles, and the square league
equal to 4,428 acres. This is its meaning as used in Texas
land grants. United States v. Perot, 98 U.S. 428, 25 L.Ed.
251; Hunter v. Morse, 49 Tex. 219. "League and labor,"
an area of land equivalent to 4,605 acres. Ammons v.
Dwyer, 78 Tex. 639, 15 S. W. 1049. See Labor.

325 Ill.App. 375, 60 N.E.2d 457, 462; Union Central

ing a legal estate in hereditaments, corporeal or incorpo-
real, conveys a portion of his interest to another, in con-
sideration of a certain annual rent or render, or other

Instrument granting exclusive possession or control of
premises, or portion, though use be restricted by reserva-
tions, will be considered lease, Barnett v. Lincoln, 162
Wash. 613, 299 P. 392, 394.
"Lease" or "hire" is a synallagmatic contract, to which
consent alone is sufficient, and by which one party gives
to the other the enjoyment of a thing, or his labor, at a
fixed price. Civil Code La. art. 2669.
Oral agreement whereby property owner for fixed con-
sideration gave another trapping privileges on his lands for
trapping season held contract of "lease." Defelice v.
Autin, La.App., 159 So. 648, 649.
The person who conveys is termed the "lessor," and the
person to whom they are conveyed, the "lessee;" and
when the lessor conveys lands or tenements to a lessee, he
is said to lease, demise, or let them. 4 Cruise, Dig. 58:
U. S. Nat. Bank of La Grande v. Miller, 122 Or. 285, 258
P. 205, 207, 58 A.L.R. 339; Howard v. Manning, 79 Okl.
165, 192 P. 358, 360, 79 A.L.R. 819. The word when used
as verb, means to transfer for term specified therein from
lessor to lessee property therein demised, also to let, to
farm out, to rent; and there is authority for view that
word "lease" may properly be used in two senses, first, in
describing act of lessor in giving lease, and again in
describing act of lessee in taking lease. Stone v. City of
Los Angeles, 114 Cal.App, 192, 299 P. 838, 841.
The term embraces what are described as the covenants
of the lease. Goldberg v. Grossman, 105 Pa.Super. 50, 160
A. 138, 139.
Whatever is sufficient to show that one party shall divest
himself of possession and the other party shall come into
it for a determinate time and for a fixed rental amounts to
a lease. General American Life Ins. Co. v. North American
Mfg. Co., 320 Ill.App. 488, 51 N.E.2d 619.
When the contract is bipartite the one part is called the
Concurrent Lease
One granted for a term which is to commence before the
expiration sr other determination of a previous lease of
the same premises made to another person; or, in other
words, an assignment of a part of the reversion, entitling
the lessee to all the rents accruing on the previous lease
after the date of his lease and to appropriate remedies
against the holding tenant. Cargill v. Thompson, 57 Minn.
'534, 59 N.W. 638.
Farm Lease
See Farm Lease.
Lease and Release
A species of conveyance much used in England, said to
have been invented by Serjeant Moore, soon after the
enactment of the statute of uses. It is thus contrived: A.
lease, or rather bargain and sale upon some pecuniary con-
sideration for one year, is made by the tenant of the
freehold to the lessee or bargainee. This, without any
enrolment, makes the bargainor stand seised to the use of
the bargainee, and vests in the bargainee the use of the
term for one year, and then the statute immediately
annexes the possession. Being thus in possession, he is
capable of receiving a release of the freehold and rever-
sion, which must be made to the tenant in possession, and
accordingly the next day a release is granted to him. The
lease and release, when used as a conveyance of the fee,
have the joint operation of a single conveyance. 2 Bl.
Comm. 339; 4 Kent, Comm. 482; Co.Litt. 207; Cruise,
Dig. tit. 32, c. 11.
Mining Lease
See Mining.
Parol Lease
A lease of real estate not evidenced by writing, but
resting in an oral agreement.
Perpetual Lease
A lease of lands which may last without limitation as to
time; a grant of lands in fee with the reservation of a
rent in fee; a fee-farm. Edwards v. Noel, 88 Mo.App. 434.
Sublease, or Underlease
One executed by the lessee of an estate to a third person,
conveying the same estate for a shorter term than that
for which the lessee holds it. The distinction between an
assignment of a term for years and a sublease or sublet-
ting is that if the lessee parts with his entire interest in
the term, it constitutes an assignment and not a subletting,
although the transfer is in form a sublease; but if the
lessee reserves to himself a reversionary interest in the
term, it constitutes a sublease, whatever the form of the
transfer. Johnson v. Thompson, 185 Ala. 666, 64 So. 554,
555; Weigle v. Rogers, 202 Mo.App. 520, 213 S.W. 501, 502;
Holden v. Tidwell, 37 Okl. 553, 133 P. 54, 55, 49 L.R.A.,

Tex.Civ.App., 258 S.W. 241, 242.

## LEASEHOLD

An estate in realty held under a
lease; an estate for a fixed term of years. See

858; State, for Use of Woodlands Cemetery Co.
of Philadelphia v. Lodge, 2 Terry 125, 16 A.2d
"Legacy" and "bequest" are equivalent terms. But in
strict common-law terminology "legacy" and "devise" do
not mean the same thing and are not interchangeable, lat-
ter being properly used only in relation to real estate.
But by construction the word "legacy" may be so extended
as to include realty or interests therein. See In re Ross's
Estate, 140 Cal. 282, 73 P. 976; Bacon v. Bacon, 55 Vt. 247;
Roth's Appeal, 94 Pa. 191; Williams v. McComb, 38 N.C.
455; In re Stuart's Will, 115 Wis. 294, 91 N.W. 688.
Absolute Legacy
One given without condition and intended to vest imme-
diately.
Accumulative Legacy
A second, double, or additional legacy; a legacy given in
addition to another given by the same instrument, or by
another instrument.
Additional Legacy
One given to the same legatee in addition to (and not in
lieu of) another legacy given before by the same will or in
a codicil thereto.
Alternate Legacy
One by which the testator gives one of two or more
things without designating which.
Conditional Legacy
One which is liable to take effect or to be defeated
according to the occurrence or non-occurrence of some
uncertain event. Harker v. Smith, 41 Ohio St. 238, 52
Am. Rep. 80; Markham v. Hufford, 123 Mich. 505, 82 N.W.
222, 48 L.R.A. 580, 81 Am.St.Rep. 222.
Contingent Legacy
A legacy given to a person at a future uncertain time,
that may or may not arrive; as "at his age of twenty-
one," or "if" or "when he attains twenty-one." 2 Bl.
Comm. 513; 2 Steph.Comm. 259. A legacy made depend-
ent upon some uncertain event. 1 Rop.Leg. 506. A legacy
which has not vested. In re Engles' Estate, 166 Pa. 280,
31 A. 76; Andrews v. Russell, 127 Ala. 195, 28 So. 703;
Rubencane v. McKee, 6 Del.Ch. 40, 6 A. 639.
Cumulative Legacies
These are legacies so called to distinguish them from
legacies which are merely repeated. In the construction of
testamentary instruments, the question often arises wheth-
er, where a testator has twice bequeathed a legacy to the
same person, the legatee is entitled to both, or only to one
of them; in other words, whether the second legacy must
be considered as a mere repetition of the first, or as cumu-
lative, i. e., additional. In determining this question, the
intention of the testator, if it appears on the face of the
instrument, prevails. Wharton.
Demonstrative Legacy
A bequest of a certain sum of money, with a direction
that it shall be paid out of a particular fund. It differs
from a specific legacy in this respect : that, if the fund out
of which it is payable fails for any cause, it is neverthe-
less entitled to come on the estate as a general legacy.
And it differs from a general legacy in this: that it does
not abate in that class, but in the class of specific legacies.
Kenaday v. Sinnott, 179 U.S. 606, 21 S.Ct. 233, 45 L.Ed. 339;
Spinney v. Eaton, 111 Me. 1, 87 A. 378, 380, 46 L.R.A.,N.S.,
535; In re Douglas' Estate, 149 Minn. 276, 183 N.W. 355,
356; In re Wilson's Estate, 260 Pa. 407, 103 A. 880, 6
A.L.R. 1349; Baker v. Baker, 319 Ill. 320, 150 N.E. 284,
general legacy; but there are legacies of quantity in the
nature of specific legacies, as of so much money, with
reference to a particular fund for payment. This kind of
legacy is called by the civilians a "demonstrative legacy,"
and it is so far general and differs so much in effect from
one properly specific that, if the fund be called in or fail,
the legatee will not be deprived of his legacy, but be per-
mitted to receive it out of the general assets; yet the leg-
acy is so far specific that it will not be liable to abate with
general legacies upon a deficiency of assets. 2 Williams,
Ex'rs, 1078.
General Legacy
A pecuniary legacy, payable out of the general assets of

is that if a defect in, or invalidity of, a claim to
land is such as to require legal acumen to discov-
er it, whether it appears upon the face of the rec-
ord or proceedings, or is to be proved aliunde, then
the powers or jurisdiction of a court of equity
may be invoked to remove the cloud created by
such defect or invalidity. Schwab v. City of St.
Louis, 310 Mo. 116, 274 S.W. 1058, 1060.

1005; Perkins v. Safe Deposit & Trust Co. of Bal-

Legal age may be full or partial. As respects the for-
mer, the common law fixes the beginning of such period

as respects the latter, a person may be of legal age for cer-
tain purposes before arriving at the age of 21 years both

those of guardians were no longer regarded as necessary

the case of boys is upon their arrival at the age of 21
years, and in the case of girls at the age of 18 years. Per-
kins v. Safe Deposit & Trust Co. of Baltimore, 138 Md. 299,
113 A. 877, 880. The expression "scholars of legal school

convenience, which have nothing to do with the

These officers are confined in their duties by the constitu-
tion generally to make laws, though sometimes, in cases
of impeachment, one of the houses of the legislature
exercises judicial functions somewhat similar to those of a
grand jury, by presenting to the other articles of impeach-
ment, and the other house acts as a court in trying such
impeachment.

Letting the contract is the choosing one from among
the number of bidders, and the formal making of the con-
tract with him. The letting, or putting out, is a different
thing from the invitation to make proposals; the letting
is subsequent to the invitation. It is the act of awarding

lent to "it is hereby ordered that the writ issue," etc. See
Ingram v. Laroussini, 50 La.Ann. 69, 23 So. 498.

liver to bail on arrest.

pound phrases known to commercial law and jurispru-
dence; e. g., letter of attorney, letter missive, letter of
credit, letters patent. The plural is frequently used.
Metaphorically, the verbal expression; the strict
literal meaning.

means the strict and exact force of the language employed,
as distinguished from the general purpose and policy of the
law.
He who, being the owner of a thing, lets it out
to another for hire or compensation. Story,
Bailm. § 369.

## LETTER OF LICENSE

In English law, a writ-
ten instrument in the nature of an agreement,
signed by all the creditors of a failing or embar-
rassed debtor in trade, granting him an extension
of time for the payment of the debts, allowing
him in the meantime to carry on the business in
the hope of recuperation, and protecting him from
arrest, suit, or other interference pending the
agreement.
This form is not usual in America; but something sim-
ilar to it is found in the "composition" or "extension
agreement," by which all the creditors agree to fund their
claims in the form of promissory notes, concurrent as to
date and maturity, sometimes payable serially and some-
times extending over a term of years. Provision is often
made for the supervision or partial control of the business,
in the meantime, by a trustee or a committee of the cred-
itors, in which case the agreement is sometimes called a
"deed of inspectorship," though this term is more com-
monly used in England than in the United States.

testate, the officer entitled to grant letters of ad-

tor; his only business being to collect the goods
and keep them in his safe custody. 2 Bla.Com.

## LETTERS CLOSE

are grants of the king, and, being of private con-
cern, they are thus distinguished from letters pat-
ent.

## LETTERS OF ABSOLUTION

ters, used in former times, when an abbot released
any of his brethren ab omnia sub jectione et obedi-
entia, etc., and made them capable of entering into
some other order of religion. Jacob.

## LETTERS OF CORRESPONDENCE

by which an inferior judge of ecclesiastical juris-
diction requests the judge of a superior court to
take and determine any matter which has come

sistory court.

## LETTERS OF SAFE CONDUCT

No subject of a
nation at war with England can, by the law of na-
tions, come into the realm, nor can travel himself
upon the high seas, or send his goods and mer-
chandise from one place to another, without dan-
ger of being seized, unless he has letters of safe
conduct.
By divers old statutes these must be granted under the
great seal, and enrolled in chancery, or else are of no
effect; the sovereign being the best judge of such emer-
gencies as may deserve exemption from the general law of
arms. But passports or licenses from the ambassadors
abroad are now more usually obtained, and are allowed to
be of equal validity. Wharton.

## LETTERS OF SLAINS, OR SLANES

Letters
subscribed by the relatives of a person who had
been slain, declaring that they had received an

by one country, speaking through one of its courts,
requests another country, acting through its own

A formal communication in writing, sent by a
court in which an action is pending to a court or
judge of a foreign country, requesting that the
testimony of a witness resident within the juris-
diction of the latter court may be there formally
taken under its direction and transmitted to the
first court for use in the pending action.
This process was also in use, at an early period, between
the several states of the Union. The request rests entirely
upon the comity of courts towards each other. See Union
Square Bank v. Reichmann, 41 N.Y.S. 602, 9 App.Div. 596.

cation of private pique or revenge, and without any reason
being assigned for such punishment. They were also
granted by the king for the purpose of shielding his fa-
vorites or their friends from the consequences of their
crimes ; and thus were as pernicious in their operation as
the protection afforded by the church to criminals in a
former age. Abolished during the Revolution of 1789.
Wharton.

hundred paces. Spelman.

writ directed to the sheriff for levying the remnant
of a partly-satisfied debt upon the lands and tene-
ments or chattels of the debtor. Cowell.

## LEVATO VELO

Lat. An expression used in the
Roman law, and applied to the trial of wreck and
salvage. Commentators disagree about the origin
of the expression; but all agree that its general
meaning is that these causes shall be heard sum-
marily.
The most probable solution is that it refers to the place
where causes were heard. A sail was spread before the
bunal. When these causes were heard, this sail was raised,
and suitors came directly to the court, and their causes
were heard immediately. As applied to maritime courts,
its meaning is that causes should be heard without delay.
These causes require dispatch, and a delay amounts prac-
tically to a denial of justice. (See Cod. 11, 4, 5.) Bouvier.

earth constructed along the margin of a river, to

ing) a landing place on a river or lake; a place on a river

either a wharf or pier or the natural bank. See Coffin v.

## LEX

Lat.
In medieval jurisprudence. A body or collec-
tion of various laws peculiar to a given nation or
people; not a code in the modern sense, but an
aggregation or collection of laws not codified or
systematized. See Mackeld.Rom.Law, § 98.
Also, a similar collection of laws relating to a general
subject, and not peculiar to any one people.
In modern American and English jurisprudence.
A system or body of laws, written or unwritten, or
so much thereof as may be applicable to a particu-
lar case or question, considered as being local or
peculiar to a given state, country, or jurisdiction,
or as being different from the laws or rules re-
lating to the same subject-matter which prevail
in some other place.
In old English law. A body or collection of laws,
and particularly the Roman or civil law.
Also a form or mode of trial or process of law, as the
ordeal or battel, or the oath of a party with compurgators,
as in the phrases legem facere, legem vadiare, etc. Also
used in the sense of legal rights or civil rights or the pro-
tection of the law, as in the phrase legem amittere.
In Roman law. Law; a law; the law.
This term was often used as the synonym of jus, in the
sense of a rule of civil conduct authoritatively prescribed
for the government of the actions of the members of an
organized jural society.
Lex is used in a purely juridical sense, law, and not
also right; while jus has an ethical as well as a juridical
meaning, not only law, but right. 15 L.Q.R. 367 (by Sal-
mond). Lex is usually concrete, while jus is abstract. In
ethical meanings, as do jus and its French equivalent,
droit. Pollock, First Book of Jurispr. 14-18.
In a more limited and particular sense, it was a resolu-
tion adopted by the whole Roman "populus" (patricians
and plebeians) in the comitia, on the motion of a magis-
trate of senatorial rank, as a consul, a praetor, or a dicta-
tor. Such a statute frequently took the name of the pro-
poser ; as the lex Falcidia, lex Cornelia, etc.
A rule of law which magistrates and people had agreed
upon by means of a solemn declaration of consensus.
Sohm, Inst.R.L. 28.
In a somewhat wider and more generic sense, a law
(whatever its origin) or the aggregate of laws, relating
to a particular subject-matter, thus corresponding to the
meaning of the word "law" in some modern phrases, such
as the "law of evidence," "law of wills," etc.
Other specific meanings of the word in Roman Jurispru-
dence were as follows : Positive law, as opposed to natural.
That system of law which descended from the Twelve Ta-
bles, and formed the basis of all the Roman law. The
terms of a private covenant; the condition of an obliga-
tion. A form of words prescribed to be used upon particu-
lar occasions.

## LEX IEBUTIA

A statute which introduced and
authorized new and more simple methods of insti-
tuting actions at law.
The law which, with the leges Julice, In part abolished
the legis actiones. It provided that a judicium could be in-
stituted in a city court without legis actio, merely by
means of the formula or prwtorian decree of appointment,
and placed the legis actio and the formula, so far as the
civil law was concerned, on a footing of equality. Sohm,
Rom. L. 173.
LEX "ELIA SENTIA. The 2Elian Sentian law,
respecting wills, proposed by the consuls JElius
and Sentius, and passed A. U. C. 756, restraining
a master from manumitting his slaves in certain
cases. Calvin.
LEX 1EMILIA. A law which reduced the official
term of the censors at Rome from five years to a
year and a half, and provided for the discharge of

hold him up to scorn and ridicule and to feelings of con-
tempt or execration, impair him in the enjoyment of gen-
eral society, and injure those imperfect rights of friendly
intercourse and mutual benevolence which man has with
respect to man. Newell, Sian. & L. 67.

ere, to mark on such petition the answer to it. Libellum

sation of a crime. Libellus divortii, a writing of divorce-

## LIBELOUS

libel; constituting or involving libel. See, also,

## LIBELOUS PER QUOD

Expressions "libelous
per quod" are such as require that their injurious
character or effect be established by allegation
and proof. Talbot v. Mack, 41 Nev. 245, 169 P.
25, 32. They are those expressions which are not
actionable upon their face, but which become so
by reason of the peculiar situation or occasion up-
on which the words are written. Oliveros v. Hen-
derson, 116 S.C. 77, 106 S.E. 855, 857; Norton v,
Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., 184 S.C. 525, 193
S.E. 126, 128. Publications which are susceptible
of two reasonable interpretations, one of which
is defamatory and the other is not, or publications
which are not obviously defamatory, but which
become so when considered in connection with in-
nuendo, colloquium, and explanatory circumstan-
ces, Flake v. Greensboro News Co., 212 N.C. 780,
195 S.E. 55, 59.

## LIBELOUS PER SE

A publication is libelous
per se when the words are of such a character
that an action may be brought upon them without
the necessity of showing any special damage, the
imputation being such that the law will presume
that any one so slandered must have suffered
damage. See Mayrant v. Richardson, 1 Nott. &
McC. (S.C.) 349, 9 Am.Dec. 707; Woolworth v.
Star Co., 97 App.Div. 525, 90 N.Y.S. 147; Morse
v. Times-Republican Printing Co., 124 Iowa 707,
100 N.W. 867. To render words "libelous per se,"
the words must be of such character that a pre-
sumption of law will arise therefrom that the
plaintiff has been degraded in the estimation of
his friends or of the public or has suffered some
other loss either in his property, character, repu-
tation, or business or in his domestic or social
relations. Whitaker v. Sherbrook Distributing
Co., 189 S.C. 243, 200 S.E. 848, 849. See, also, Ac-
tionable Words.

822, 136 P.2d 297, 301, 155 A.L.R. 1338; dishonor or dis-
credit a man in estimate of the public or his friends and
acquaintances, or expose him to ridicule, or have a reason-
able tendency to do so, O'Leary v, Hearst Magazines, 4
N.Y.S.2d 79, 167 Misc. 481; expose a person to hatred, dis-
trust, contempt, ridicule, or obloquy, or tend to cause him
to be shunned or avoided, or to injure him in office, oc-
cupation, business, or employment. Layne v. Tribune Co.,

subject him to public distrust, ridicule, or contempt, Jude-
vine v. Benzies-Montanye Fuel & Warehouse Co., 222 Wis.

Liberty, on its positive side, denotes the fullness of in-
dividual existence; on its negative side it denotes the nec-
essary restraint on all, which is needed to promote the
greatest possible amount of liberty for each. Amos,
Science of Law, p. 90.
The word "liberty" as used in the state and federal Con-
stitutions means, in a negative sense, freedom from re-
straint, but in a positive sense, it involves the idea of free-
dom secured by the imposition of restraint, and it is in this
positive sense that the state. in the exercise of its police
powers, promotes the freedom of all by the imposition
upon particular persons of restraints which are deemed
necessary for the general welfare. Fitzsimmons v. New
York State Athletic Commission, Sup., 146 N.Y.S. 117, 121.
"Liberty," in so far as it is noticed by government, is
restraint, rather than license. It is a yielding of the in-
dividual will to that of the many, subject to such constitu-
tional guarantees or limitations as will preserve those
rights and privileges which are admitted of all men to be
fundamental. "Liberty" in the civil state is a giving up Of
natural right in consideration of equal protection and op-
portunity. Weber v. Doust, 84 Wash. 330, 146 P. 623, 625.
The "personal liberty" guaranteed by Const. U. S.
Amend. 13 consists in fhe power of locomotion without im-
prisonment or restraint unless by due course of law, ex-
cept those restraints imposed to prevent commission of
threatened crime or in punishment of crime committed,
those in punishment of contempts of courts or legislative
bodies or to render their jurisdiction effectual, and those
necessary to enforce the duty citizens owe in defense of
the state to protect community against acts of those who
by reason of mental infirmity are incapable of self-control.
Ex parte Hudgins, 86 W.Va. 526, 103 S.E. 327, 329, 9 A.L.R.
The "liberty" safeguarded by Fourteenth Amendment is
liberty in a social organization which requires the protec-
tion of law against the evils which menace the health,
safety, morals, and welfare of the people. West Coast
Hotel Co. v. Parrish, Wash., 57 S.Ct. 578, 581, 582, 300 U.S.
379, 81 L.Ed. 703, 108 A.L.R. 1330.
Also, a franchise or personal privilege, being
some part of the sovereign power, vested in an
individual, either by grant or prescription.
The term is used in the expression, rights, liberties, and
franchises, as a word of the same general class and mean-
ing with those words and privileges. This use of the term
is said to have been strictly conformable to its sense as
used in Magna Charta and in English declarations of
rights, statutes, grants, etc.; Corn. v. Alger, 7 Cush.
(Mass.) 70.
In a derivative sense, the place, district, or
boundaries within which a special franchise is en-
joyed, an immunity claimed, or a jurisdiction ex-
ercised. In this sense, the term is commonly used
in the plural; as the "liberties of the city."
Civil Liberty
The liberty of a member of society, being a
man's natural liberty, so far restrained by human.
laws (and no further) as is necessary and exped-
ient for the general advantage of the public. 1
El. Comm. 125; 2 Steph. 487
The power of doing whatever the laws permit. 1 Bl.
Comm. 6; Inst. 1, 3, 1. See Dennis v. Moses, 18 Wash. 537,
52 P. 333, 40 L.R.A. 302. The greatest amount of absolute
liberty which can, in the nature of things, be equally pos-
sessed by every citizen in a state. Guarantied protection
against interference with the interests and rights held dear
and important by large classes of civilized men, or by all
the members of a state, together with an effectual share
in the making and administration of the laws, as the best
' Liberty of a Port
In marine insurance. A license or permission
incorporated in a marine policy allowing the ves-
sel to touch and trade at a designated port other
than the principal port of destination. See Al-
legre v. Maryland Ins. Co., 8 Gill & J. (Md.) 200,
29 Am.Dec. 536.
Liberty of Conscience
Liberty for each individual to decide for himself
what is to him religious. Gobitis v. Minersville
School Dist., D.C.Pa., 21 F.Supp. 581, 584. See,
also, Religious Liberty, as defined below.
Liberty of Contract
The ability at will, to make or abstain from mak-
ing, a binding obligation enforced by the sanc-
tions at the law. Judson, Liberty of Contract, Rep.
Am. Bar Ass'n (1891) 233.
The right to contract about one's affairs, including the
right to make contracts of employment, and to obtain the
best terms one can as the result of private bargaining.
Adkins v. Children's Hospital of District of Columbia, 43 S.
Ct. 394, 396, 261 U.S. 525, 67 L.Ed. 785, 24 A.L.R. 1238. It
includes the corresponding right to accept a contract pro-
posed. St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co. of Texas v. Griffin,
106 Tex. 477, 171 S.W. 703, 704, L.R.A.1917B, 1108. There
is, however, no absolute freedom of contract. The govern-
ment may regulate or forbid any contract reasonably cal-
culated to affect injuriously public interest. Atlantic Coast
Line R. Co. v. Riverside Mills, 31 S.Ct. 164, 219 U.S. 186,
55 L.Ed. 167, 31 L.R.A.,N.S., 7; Carleton Screw Products
Co. v. Fleming, C.C.A.Minn., 126 F.2d 537, 541. It means
freedom from arbitrary or unreasonable restraint, not im-
munity from reasonable regulation to safeguard public
interest, Saucier v. Life & Casualty Ins. Co. of Tennessee,
189 Miss. 693, 198 So. 625, 631; or the right to make con-
tracts with competent persons on a plane of relative parity
or freedom of choice and within the limits allowed or not
forbidden by law. McGrew v. Industrial Commission, 96
Utah 203, 85 P.2d 608, 612.
Liberty of Speech
Freedom accorded by the constitution or laws
of a state to express opinions and facts by word
of mouth, uncontrolled by any censorship or re-
strictions of government.
But language tending to the violation of the rights of
personal security and private property, and toward
breaches of the public peace, is an abuse of the right, State
v. Boyd, 86 N.J.L. 75, 91 A. 586, 587; which is not license,
nor lawlessness, but rather the right to fairly criticize and
comment, State v. Pape, 90 Conn. 98, 96 A. 313, 315. Lib-
erty never has meant the unrestricted right to say what
one pleases at all times and under all circumstances. Fra-
ina v. U. S., C.C.A.N.Y., 255 F. 28, 35. It is not an abso-
lute right. State v. Chaplinsky, 91 N.H. 310, 18 A.2d 754,
760. It has been thought that the liberty to speak includes
the corresponding right to be silent, and that this right is
infringed by a statute compelling a corporation to give a
discharged employee a statement of the cause of discharge.
St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co. of Texas v. Griffin, 106
Tex. 477, 171 S.W. 703, 705, L.R.A.1917B, 1108. As used in
Constitution, "freedom of speech" means freedom of
speech as it was understood by the common law when the
Constitution was adopted. State v. Boloff, 138 Or. 568, 7
P.2d 775, 781.
Liberty of the Globe
In marine insurance. A license or permission
incorporated in a marine policy authorizing the
vessel to go to any part of the world, instead of
being confined to a particular port of destination.
Liberty of the Press
The right to print and publish the truth, from
good motives and for justifiable ends. People v.
Croswell, 3 Johns. Cas. 394. Kline v. Robert M.
McBride & Co., 11 N.Y.S.2d 674, 679, 170 Misc. 974.
The right to print without any previous license, subject
to the consequences of the law. 3 Term 431; Respublica
v. Dennie, 4 Yeates, Pa., 267, 2 Am.Dec. 402; Williams
Printing Co. v. Saunders, 113 Va. 156, 73 S.E. 472, Ann.Cas.
1913E, 693. The right to publish whatever one may please.
Knapp v. Post Printing & Publishing Co., 111 Colo. 492,
144 P.2d 981, 985; Howard Sports Daily v. Weller, 179 Md.
355, 18 A.2d 210, 215; and to be protected against any
responsibility for so doing except so far as such publica-
tions, from their .blasphemy, obscenity, or scandalous char-
acter, may be a public offense, or as by their falsehood and
malice they may injuriously affect the standing, reputa-
tion, or pecuniary interests of individuals, Cooley, Const.
Lim. p. 422. It is said to consist in this : "That neither
courts of justice, nor any judges whatever, are authorized
to take notice of writings intended for the press, but are
confined to those which are actually printed." De Lolme,
Eng.Const. 254. Immunity from previous restraints or
[from] censorship. Grosjean v. American Press Co., La.,
297 U.S. 233, 56 S.Ct. 444, 449, 80 L.Ed. 660.
Liberty of the Rules
A privilege to go out of the Fleet and Marshal-
sea prisons within certain limits, and there reside.
Abolished by 5 & 6 Vict. c. 22.
Liberty to Hold Pleas
The liberty of having a court of one's own. Thus
certain lords had the privilege of holding pleas
within their own manors.
Natural Liberty
The power of acting as one thinks fit, without
any restraint or control, unless by the law of na-
ture. 1 Bl. Comm. 125.
The right which nature gives to all mankind of disposing
of their persons and property after the manner they judge
most consistent with their happiness, on condition of their
acting within the limits of the law of nature, and so as not
to interfere with an equal exercise of the same rights by
other men. Burlamaqui, c. 3, § 15; 1 Bl.Comm. 125. It is
called by Lieber social liberty, and is defined as the pro-
tection or unrestrained action in as high a degree as the
same claim of protection of each individual admits of.
Personal Liberty
The right or power of locomotion; of changing
situation, or moving one's person to whatsoever
place one's own inclination may direct, without
imprisonment or restraint, unless by due course
of law. 1 Bl. Comm. 134. Civil Rights Cases, 3
S.Ct. 42, 109 U.S. 3, 27 L.Ed. 835; Pinkerton v.
Verberg, 78 Mich. 573, 44 N.W. 579, 7 L.R.A. 507,

erations of government, and particularly in the

tertain and express any or no system of religious
opinions, and to engage in or refrain from any
form of religious observance or public or private
religious worship, not inconsistent with the peace
and good order of society and the general wel-
fare. See Frazee's Case, 63 Mich, 396, 30 N.W. 72,
6 Am.St.Rep. 310; State v. White, 64 N.H. 48, 5 A.

wars, to pay a sum of money, and the like. 2 Bl. Comm. 60.

of Paris Dry Goods Co., 14 Ca1.2d 633, 96 P.2d 122, 124; a
privilege to occupy under the owner, Rhode Island Marine
Transp. Co. v. Interstate Nay. Co., 52 R.I. 322, 161 A. 108,
109; San Juan Gold Co. v. San Juan Ridge Mut. Water
Ass'n, 34 Cal.App.2d 159, 93 P.2d 582, 589; an authority to
do a particular act or series of acts which would amount
to a trespass without permission, Barnett v. Lincoln, 162
Wash. 613, 299 P. 392, 394. It does not operate to confer
upon or vest in licensee any title, interest or estate in
property and licensee is "estopped" during time that
license exists to deny title of licensor or of any one claim-
ing under him, Wood v. Gregory, Mo., 155 S.W.2d 168, 171,
172. It is unassignable, 'Sweeney v. Bird, 293 Mich. 624, 292
N.W. 506, 508, 509.
A license is distinguished from an "easement," which
implies an Interest in the land, and a "lease," or right to
take the profits of land. It may be, however, and often, is,
coupled with a grant of some interest in the land itself, or
right to take the profits. 1 Washb.Real Prop. *398; Davis
v. Tway, 16 Ariz. 566, 147 P. 750, L.R.A.1915E, 604; Na-
tional Memorial Park v. C. I. R., C.C.A.4, 145 F.2d 1008,
A license is an authority to enter on land which is gen-
erally granted by parol and may be revoked by the licensor
at pleasure and is not assignable, being a personal privi-
lege, while an easement confers an interest in the land and
may not be terminated at the pleasure of the servient
owner. Louisville Chair & Furniture Co. v. Otter, 219 Ky.
757, 294 S.W. 483, 485.
The distinction between an easement and a license is
often so metaphysical, subtle, and shadowy as to elude
analysis. But there are certain fundamental principles
underlying most cases which enable courts to distinguish
an easement from a license when construed in the light of
surrounding circumstances. East Jersey Iron Co. v.
Wright, 32 N.J.Eq. 254; Nunnelly v. Iron Co., 94 Tenn:
397, 29 S.W. 361, 28 L.R.A. 421.
A "tenancy" implies some interest in the land leased,
while a "license" conveys only a temporary privilege in
the use of property usually revocable at the will of the
licensor. Klein v. City of Portland, 106 Or. 686, 213 P.
147, 150; Vicker v. Byrne, 155 Wis. 281, 143 N.W. 186, 188.
But see Mitchell v. Probst, 52 Okl. 10, 152 P. 597, 598.
An "invitation" is inferred where there is a common
interest or mutual advantage, or where an owner or occu-
pant of premises, by acts or conduct, leads another to
believe the premises or something thereon were intended
to be used by such other person, that such use is not only
acquiesced in by the owner or occupant, but is in accord-
ance with the intention or design for which the way, place,
or thing was adapted or prepared or allowed to be used;
while a "license" is implied where the object is the mere
pleasure, convenience, or benefit of the person enjoying the
privilege. Kruntorad v. Chicago, R. I. & P. Ry. Co., 111
Neb. 753, 197 N.W. 611, 612. Polluck v. Minneapolis & St.
L. R. Co., 44 S.D. 249, 183 N.W. 859, 862.

able at pleasure. City of Boston v. A. W. Perry,
Inc., 304 Mass. 18, 22 N.E.2d 627, 630; Lanham v.
Forney, 196 Wash. 62, 81 P.2d 777, 779.

vehicles for hire may issue licenses; license being permis-
sion. Ex parte Schutte, 118 Tex.Cr.R. 182, 42 S.W.2d 252,
255. Permissive use and license as synonymous, Aldine
Realty Co. of Pittsburgh v. Manor Real Estate & Trust Co.,

Co. v. Commonwealth, 310 Mass. 528, 39 N.E.2d 87, 103, 106,

operation thereon of motor carriers for hire can be
acquired only by permission or license from the state

mobile Law and Prac., Perm. Ed., 331.

A license confers upon licensee neither contractual nor
vested rights. Rosenblatt v. California State Board of
Pharmacy, 69 Cal.App.2d 69, 158 P.2d 199, 203. Asbury
Hospital v. Cass County, 72 N.D. 359, 7 N.W.2d 438, 452.
Nor does it create a property right. State ex rel. Zugravu
v. O'Brien, 130 Ohio St. 23, 196 N.E. 664.
Trade-Mark
Permission to use a trade-mark in an area where
the purported owner's goods have not become
known and identified by his use of mark is a
naked "license". E. F. Prichard Co. V. Consumers
Brewing Co., C.C.A.Ky., 136 F.2d 512, 521.

## LICENSE CASES

The name given to the group
of cases including Peirce v. New Hampshire, 5
How. 504, 12 L.Ed. 256, decided by the United
States supreme court in 1847, to the effect that
state laws requiring a license or the payment of a
tax for the privilege of selling intoxicating liquors
were not in conflict with the constitutional provi-
sion giving to congress the power to regulate in-
terstate commerce, even as applied to liquors im-
ported from another state and remaining in the
original and unbroken packages. This decision
was overruled in Leisy v. Hardin, 10 Sup.Ct. 681,
135 U.S. 100, 34 L.Ed. 128, which in turn was count-
eracted by the act of congress of August 8, 1890,
commonly called the "Wilson law."
LICENSE FEE or TAX. Charge imposed by sov-
ereign for a privilege. Pennsylvania Liquor Con-
trol Board v. Publicker Commercial Alcohol Co.,
347 Pa. 555, 32 A.2d 914, 917. Stone v. General
Contract Purchase Corporation, 193 Miss. 301,
7 So.2d 806, 808, 140 A.L.R. 1029.
Charge or fee imposed primarily for the discouragement
of danger°. is employments, the protection of the safety of
the public, or the regulation of relative rights, privileges,
or duties as between individuals, Conard v. State, Del.
Super., 2 Terry 107, 16 A.2d 121, 125. Price paid to gov-
ernmental or municipal authority for a license to engage in

cising corporate franchise. City Investments v. Johnson,
6 Ca1.2d 150, 56 P.2d 939, 940. The term "license tax"
includes both charge imposed under police power for privi-
lege of obtaining license to conduct particular business,
and tax imposed upon business for sole purpose of raising
revenue; "license tax" being defined as sum exacted for
privilege of carrying on particular occupation. City of
Waycross v. Bell, 169 Ga. 57, 149 S.E. 641, 642. Where a
fee is exacted and something is required or permitted in
addition to the payment of the sum, either to be done by
the licensee, or by some regulation or restriction imposed
on him, then the fee is a "license fee". Conard v. State,
Del.Super., 2 Terry 107, 16 A.2d 121, 125.

A person who goes
upon the lands of another with express or im-
plied invitation to transact business with the own-
er or occupant or do some act to his advantage or

Hallam (Const. Hist. c. 13) to acts of parliament
for the restraint of printing, except by license.
It may also be applied to any act of parliament passed
for the purpose of requiring a license for doing any act
whatever. But, generally, when we speak of the licensing
acts, we mean the acts regulating the sale of intoxicating
license.

## LICENTIA

## LICENTIA CONCORDANDI

In old practice and
conveyancing. License or leave to agree; one
of the proceedings on levying a fine of lands. 2 Bl,
Comm. 350.

## LICENTIA LOQUENDI

In old practice. Leave
to speak, (i. e., with the plaintiff;) an imparlance;
or rather leave to imparl. 3 Bl. Comm. 299.

In old English practice.
License to arise; permission given by the court to
a tenant in a real action, who had cast an essoin
de malo lecti, to arise out of his bed. Also, the

any art or faculty.

## LICENTIOUSNESS

The indulgence of the ar-
bitrary will of the individual, without regard to
ethics or law, or respect for the rights of others.
In this it differs from "liberty;" for the latter term may
properly be used only of the exercise of the will in its
moral freedom, with justice to all men and obedience to
the laws, Welch v. Durand, 36 Conn. 184, 4 Am. Rep. 55;
State v. Brigman, 94 N.C. 889; liberty is restrained by
natural or positive law, and consists in doing whatever we
please not inconsistent with the rights of others, whereas
licentiousness does not respect those rights. Wolff, Inst.

tion," and the act itself is termed "limiting the estate."
Brown.

## LIMIT

A bound; a restraint; a circumscrip-
tion; a boundary. Casler v. Connecticut Mut. L.
Ins. Co., 22 N.Y. 429. Boundary, border or outer

719, 720. Extreme boundary. Lane v. Lukens, 48

## LIMITATION

Restriction or circumspection; set-
tling an estate or property; a certain time allowed

193 S.C. 332, 8 S.E.2d 518, 520; Mulholland v. Ayers, 109
Mont. 558, 99 P.2d 234, 239.
Corporations
Under the statute providing that all corpora.
tions expiring by their own "limitation" shall for
certain purposes be continued as bodies corporate
for a term of three years, the word "limitation"
is an act of limiting, a restriction of power, a
qualification. Porter v. Tempa Min. & Mill. Co.,
59 Nev, 332, 93 P.2d 741, 743
Estates
The restriction or circumscription of an estate,
in the conveyance by which it is granted, in re-
spect to the interest of the grantee or its duration;
the specific curtailment or confinement of an es-
tate, by the terms of the grant, so that it cannot
endure beyond a certain period or a designated
contingency.
A "limitation" on a grant determines an estate upon the
happening of the event itself without the necessity of doing
any act to regain the estate, such as re-entry. Gulf Pro-
duction Co. v. Continental Oil Co., Tex., 132 S.W.2d 553,
A limitation, whether made by the express words of the
party or existing in intendment of law, circumscribes the
continuance of time for which the property is to be
enjoyed, and by positive and certain terms, or by refer-
ence to some event which possibly may happen, marks the
period at which the time of enjoyment shall end. Smith
v. Smith, 23 Wis. 181, 99 Am.Dec. 153; Hoselton v. Hosel-
ton, 166 Mo. 182, 65 S.W. 1005; Stearns v. Godfrey, 16 Me.
The "unless" provisions of oil and gas lease which pro-
vided that if no well should be commenced within one
year, lease should terminate unless privilege of commence-
ment should be deferred by payment of rental, were a
"limitation" on the grant. Gulf Production Co. v. Con-
tinental Oil Co., 139 Tex. 183, 132 S.W.2d 553, 563.
The word "limitation" defines the extent or quality of an
estate conveyed or devised. Richardson v. Roney, 382 Dl.
528, 47 N.E.2d 714.
Collateral limitation. One which gives an interest in an
estate for a specified period, but makes the right of enjoy-
ment to depend on some collateral event, as an estate to A.
till B. shall go to Rome. Templeman v. Gibbs, 86 Tex. 358,
24 S.W. 792; 4 Kent, Comm. 128.
Conditional limitation. A condition followed by a limi-
tation over to a third person in case the condition be not
fulfilled or there be a breach of it. Stearns v. Godfrey, 16
Me. 158; Hess v. Kernen Bros., 169 Iowa 646, 149 N.W. 847,
851; Yarbrough v. Yarbrough, 151 Tenn. 221, 209 S.W. 36,
38. Board of Education of Borough of West Paterson v.
Brophy, 90 N.J.Eq. 57, 106 A. 32, 34. A conditional limita-
tion is where an estate is so expressly defined and limited
by the words of its creation that it cannot endure for any
longer time than till the contingency happens upon which
the estate is to fail. 1 Steph.Comm. 309. Between condi-
tional limitations and estates depending on conditions sub-
sequent there is this difference : that in the former the
estate determines as soon as the contingency happens; but
in the latter it endures until the grantor or his heirs take
advantage of the breach. 1 Steph.Comm. 310.
Contingent limitation. When a remainder in fee is lim-
ited upon any estate which would by the common law be
adjudged a fee tail, such a remainder is valid as a con-
tingent limitation upon a fee, and vests in possession on
the death of the first taker without issue living at the time
of his death. Rev.Codes N.D.1899, 1 3328 (Comp.Laws 1913,
§ 5307).
Limitation in law. A limitation in law, or an estate lim-
ited, is an estate to be holden only during the continuance
of the condition under which it was granted, upon the
determination of which the estate vests immediately in him
in expectancy. 2 Bl.Comm. 155.
Limitation over. This term includes any estate in the
same property created or contemplated by the conveyance,
to be enjoyed after the first estate granted expires or is
exhausted. Lane v. Citizens & Southern Nat. Bank, 195
Ga. 828, 25 S.E.2d 800, 802, 803. Thus, in a gift to A. for
life, with remainder to the heirs of his body, the remain-
der is a "limitation over" to such heirs. Ewing v. Shrop-
shire, 80 Ga. 374, 7 S.E. 554.
Limitation title. Full title, precluding all claims. Free
v. Owen, 131 Tex. 281, 113 S.W.2d 1221, 1224.
Special limitation. A qualification serving to mark out
the bounds of an estate, so as to determine it ipso facto
in a given event, without action, entry, or claim, before it
would, or might, otherwise expire by force of, or according
to, the general limitation. Henderson v. Hunter, 59 Pa.
Title by limitation. A prescriptive title; one which is
indefeasible because of the expiration of the time pre-
scribed by the statute of limitations for the bringing of
actions to test or defeat it. See Dalton v. Rentaria, 2 Ariz.
275, 15 P. 37.
Words of limitation. In a conveyance or will, words
which have the effect of marking the duration of an estate
are termed "words of limitation." Thus, in a grant to A.
and his heirs, the words "and his heirs" are words of limi-
tation, because they. show that A. is to take an estate in
fee-simple and do not give his heirs anything. Fearne,
Rem. 78. And see Ball v. Payne, 6 Rand., Va., 75; Sum-
mit v. Yount, 109 Ind. 506, 9 N.E. 582.
Limitation of Actions
The term "limitation" means the time at the
end of which no action at law or suit in equity
can be maintained. Uscienski v. National Sugar
Refining Co., 18 A.2d 611, 612, 19 N.J.Misc. 240.
American Nat. Ins. Co. v. Hicks, Tex.Com.App.,
35 S.W.2d 128, 130, 75 A.L.R. 623.
The restriction by statute of the right of action to cer-
tain periods of time, after the accruing of the cause of
action, beyond which, except in certain specified cases, it
will not be allowed. Also the period' of time so limited by
law for the bringing of actions. See Keyser v. Lowell, 117
F. 404, 54 C.C.A. 574; Battle v. Shivers, 39 Ga. 409; Baker
v. Kelley, 11 Minn. 493 (Gil. 358) ; Riddelsbarger v. Hart-
ford F. Ins. Co., 7 Wall. 390, 19 L.Ed. 257.
Limitation of Assize
In old practice. A certain time prescribed by
statute, within which a man was required to al-
lege himself or his ancestor to have been seised
of lands sued for by a writ of assize. Cowell.
Statute of Limitations
A statute prescribing limitations to the right of
action on certain described causes of action; that
is, declaring that no suit shall be maintained on
such causes of action unless brought within a spe-
cified period after the right accrued. Statutes of
limitation are statutes of repose. Philadelphia, B.
& W. R. Co. v. Quaker City Flour Mills Co., 282
Pa. 362, 127 A. 845, 846, and are such legislative
enactments as prescribe the periods within which
actions may be brought upon certain claims or
within which certain rights may be enforced.
People v. Kings County Development Co., 48 Cal.
App. 72, 191 P. 1004, 1005. In criminal cases, how-
ever, a statute of limitation is an act of grace,
a surrendering by sovereign of its right to prose-
cute. People v. Ross, 325 Ill. 417, 156 N.E. 303,
LIMITED. Restricted; bounded; prescribed. Con-
fined within positive bounds; restricted in dura-
tion, extent, or scope.

1104, 1114.

## LIMITED COURT

tion in point of time. 1 Williams, Ex'rs, 249, et
seq.

## LIMITED GUARANTY

A limited guaranty is
ordinarily one restricted in its application to a
single transaction. Cooling v. Springer, 3 Terry
228, 30 A.2d 466, 469.

## LIMITED JURISDICTION

This term is ambig-
uous, and the books sometimes use it without due
precision. It is sometimes carelessly employed in-
stead of "special." The true distinction between
courts is between such as possess a general and
such as have only a special jurisdiction for a par-
ticular purpose, or are clothed with special pow-
ers for the performance. Obert v. Hammel, 18
N.J.Law, 73.

## LIMITED LIABILITY

The liability of the mem-
bers of a joint-stock company may be either un-
limited or limited; and, if the latter, then the limi-
tation of liability is either the amount, if any, un-
paid on the shares, (in which case the limit is said
to be "by shares,") or such an amount as the
members guaranty in the event of the company
being wound up, (in which case the limit is said
to be "by guaranty.") Brown.

## LIMITED OR SPECIAL JURISDICTION

Juris-
diction which is confined to particular causes, or
which can be exercised only under the limitations

be paid. Bankers Life & Loan Ass'n v. Chase,
Tex.Civ.App., 114 S.W.2d 374, 376.

## LIMITED PERIOD

As used in statutes author-
izing assignment in actions for divorce and sep-
arate maintenance, of homestead selected from
separate property of either, to innocent party for
limited period, means period of natural life of

member of the military or naval forces. See Rhodes v.
U. S., 79 F. 743, 25 C.C.A. 186. An injury suffered or dis-
ease contracted by a sailor is considered to have been in
"line of duty" unless actually caused by something for
which sailor is responsible which intervenes between his

"ascendants" and "descendants." Mackeld.Rom.Law, §
LINEA RECTA EST INDEX SUI ET OBLIQUI;
LEX EST LINEA RECTI. Co. Litt. 158. A right

the collateral. Co. Litt. 10; Broom, Max. 529.

## LINEA TRANSVERSALIS

A collateral, trans-

## LITERARY

Pertaining to polite learning; con-

The word 'literary," having no legal signification, is to
be taken in its ordinary and usual meaning. We speak of
literary persons as learned, erudite; of literary property,
es the productions of ripe scholars, or, at least, of profes-
sional writers; of literary institutions, as those where the
positive sciences are taught, or persons eminent for learn-
ing associate, for purposes connected with their profes-
sions. This we think the popular meaning of the word;
and that it would not be properly used as descriptive of a
school for the instruction of youth. Indianapolis v. Mc-
Lean, 8 Ind. 332.

An original result of mental production, developed
in a series of written or printed words, arranged

person. 9 Amer. Law Reg. 44. And see Keene v.
Wheatley, 14 Fed.Cas. 192; Palmer v. De Witt, 32
N.Y.Super.Ct. 552.
A distinction is to be taken between "literary property"
(which is the natural, common-law right a person has in
the form of written expression to which he has, by labor
and skill, reduced his thoughts) and "copyright," (which
is a statutory monopoly, above and beyond natural prop:-
erty, conferred upon an author to encourage and reward a
dedication of his literary property to the public.) Abbott.

## LITERATE

who qualifies himself for holy orders by present-
ing himself as a person accomplished in classical
learning, etc., not as a graduate of Oxford, Cam-
bridge, etc.

## LITERATURA

"Ad literaturam ponere" means
to put children to school.
This liberty was anciently denied to those parents who
were servile tenants, without the lord's consent. The pro-
hibition against the education of sons arose from the fear
that the son, being bred to letters, might enter into holy
orders, and so stop or divert the services which he might
otherwise do as heir to his father. Paroch.Antiq. 401.

## LITERIS OBLIGATIO

In Roman law. The con-
tract of nomen, which was constituted by writing,
(scripture,)
A
transaction was transferred from the daybook (adver-
saria) into the ledger (codex) in the form of a debt under
the name or heading of the purchaser or debtor, (nomen;)
and (2) a persona in personam, where a debt already
standing under one nomen or heading was transferred in
the usual course of novatio from that nomen to another
and substituted nomen. By reason of this transferring,
these obligations were called "nomina transcriptia." No
money was, in fact, paid to constitute the contract. If ever
money was paid, then the nomen was arcarium, (i. e., a
real contract, re contractus,) and not a nomen proprium.

the patrons of a garage, their cars kept at the garage
can be taken out and returned at will, day or night, the
garage keeper will be liable for a loss caused by a failure
to exercise ordinary care for the protection of such cars,

and quality. Civ.Code La. art. 2910.

the temporary possession and use of personal property, and

to another for use, to be returned in specie, and may be
either for a certain time or indefinitely, and at the will of

cifically returned; the mutuum is to be returned in kind.
In the case of a commodatum, the property in the thing
remains in the lender ; in a mutuum, the property passes
to the borrower. Bouvier.

should be regarded as a "loaned employee" in the
service of a special employer, or whether he
should be regarded as remaining in the service of
his general employer, depends upon in whose work
the employee was engaged at the time of injury.

W.2d 498, 499, 500.

his servant to another for a particular employment, serv-

with as servant of one to whom he is lent. Blair v. Dur-
ham, C.C.A.Tenn., 134 F.2d 729, 732.

ered. Walter v. Everett School Dist. No. 24, 195 Wash. 45,
79 P.2d 689.

introduced by either branch thereof, by any per-
son who misrepresents the nature of his interest
in the matter to such member, or who is employed

called the "pleadings." It also designated an "impar-
lance," (q. v.,) both names evidently referring to the talk-
ing together of the parties. Loquela sine die, a postpone-

## LOQUENDUM UT VULGUS; SENTIENDUM UT DOCTI

We must speak as the common. people;
we must think as the learned. 7 Coke, 11b.
This maxim expresses the rule that, when words are
used in a technical sense, they must be understood tech-
nically; otherwise, when they may be supposed to be used
in their ordinary acceptation.

sioner, etc.

leasing the crown lands. His functions are now vested in
the lords commissioners of the treasury. Mozley & Whitley.
Lord in gross
In feudal law. He who is lord, not by reason of any
manor, but as the king in respect of his crown, etc. "Very
lord" is he who is immediate lord to his tenant; and "very

where there is lord paramount, lord mesne, and tenant, the
lord paramount is not very lord to the tenant. Wharton.

pointed for the purpose of mustering the inhabitants for
the defense of the country.
Lord mayor
The chief officer of the corporation of the city of London
is so called. The origin of the appellation of "lord," which
the mayor of London enjoys, is attributed to the fourth
charter of Edward III., which conferred on that officer the
honor of having maces, the same as royal, carried before
him by the sergeants. Pull.Laws & Cust.Lond.
Lord mayor's court
In English law. This is a court of record, of law and
equity, and is the chief court of justice within the corpora-
tion of London. Theoretically the lord mayor and alder-
men are supposed to preside, but the recorder is in fact
the acting judge. It has jurisdiction of all personal and

regard to the amount in controversy. See 3 Steph.Comm.
449, note 1.

that all lands in the realm were held mediately or imme-
diately from him. See De Peyster v. Michael, 6 N.Y. 495,

Lord privy seal
Before the 30 Hen. VIII., was generally an ecclesiastic.
The office has since been usually conferred on temporal
peers above the degree of barons. He is appointed by let-
ters patent. The lord privy seal, receiving a warrant from
the signet office, issues the privy seal, which is an author-
ity to the lord chancellor to pass the great seal where the
nature of the grant requires it. But the privy seals for
money begin in the treasury, whence the first warrant
issues, countersigned by the lord treasurer. The lord privy
seal is a member of the cabinet council. Enc.Lond.

Lords appellants
Five. peers who for a time superseded Richard II. in his
government, and whom, after a brief control of the govern-
ment, he in turn superseded in 1397, and put the survivors
of them to death. Richard II.'s eighteen commissioners
(twelve peers and six commoners) took their place, as an
embryo privy council acting with full powers, during the
parliamentary recess. Brown.
Lords commissioners
In. English law. When a high public office in the state,
formerly executed by an individual, is put into commis-
sion, the, persons charged with the commission are called
"lords. commissioners," or sometimes "lords" or "commis-
sioners"- simply. Thus, we have, in lieu of the lord treas-
urer and lord high admiral of former times, the lords com-
missioners of the treasury, and the lords commissioners of
the admiralty; and, whenever the great seal is put into
commission, the persons charged with it are called "com-
missioners" or "lords commissioners" of the great seal.

## LUCRA NUPTIALIA

Lat. In Roman law. A
term including everything which a husband or

other, either before the marriage, or on agreeing
to it, or during its continuance, or after its dissolu-
tion, and whether the acquisition is by pure gift,

## LUCRATIVA CAUSA

•Lat. In Roman law. A
consideration which is voluntary; that is to say,
a gratuitous gift, or such like.
It was opposed to onerosa causa, which denoted a valu-
able consideration. It was a principle of the Roman law
that two lucrative causes could not concur in the same per-
son as regarded the same thing; that is to say, that, when
the same thing was bequeathed to a person by two different
testators, he could not have the thing (or its value) twice
over. Brown.

## LUCRATIVA USUCAPIO

Lat. This species of
usucapio was permitted in Roman law only in the
case of persons taking possession of property upon
the decease of its late owner, and in exclusion or
deforcement of the heir, whence it was called
"usucapio pro hcerede."
The adjective "lucrativa" denoted that property was
acquired by this usucapio without any consideration or
payment for it by way of purchase; and, as the possessor
who so acquired the property was a maid fide possessor,
his acquisition, or usucapio, was called also "improba," (i.
e., dishonest;) but this dishonesty was tolerated (until
abolished by Hadrian) as an incentive to force the hceres to
take possession, in order that the debts might be paid and
the sacrifices performed; and, as a further incentive to
the hceres, this usucapio was complete in one year. Brown.

etc., R. Co. v. Zwirtz, 13 Okl. 411, 73 P. 941.
If a bus company or other motor carrier, "to suit its
own convenience, takes possession of the luggage of a pas-
senger for hire, to care for it on the trip, and becomes
a bailee under a special contract, its liability as special
bailee is broader than that of a common carrier and in-
cludes liability for articles that might not be classed as
ordinary baggage." Blashfield, Cyc. of Automobile Law
