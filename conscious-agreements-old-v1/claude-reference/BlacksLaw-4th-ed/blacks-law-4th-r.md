## RACKETEERING

An organized conspiracy to
commit the crimes of extortion or coercion,
attempts to commit extortion or coercion. From
the standpoint of extortion, it is the obtaining of
money or property from another, with his con-
sent, induced by the wrongful use of force or fear.
The fear which constitutes the legally necessary
element in extortion is induced by oral or written
threats to do an unlawful injury to the property
of the threatened person by means of explosives,
fire, or otherwise; and to kill, kidnap, or injure
him or a relative of his or some member of his
family. From the standpoint of coercion, it usu-
ally takes the form of compelling by use of simi-
lar threats to person or property a person to do
or abstain from doing an act which such other
person has the legal right to do or abstain from
doing, such as joining a so-called protective as-
sociation to protect his right to conduct a busi-
ness or trade. United States v. McGlone, D.C.
Pa., 19 F.Supp. 285, 287.

in England, in 1818, when the popular leaders,
Hunt, Cartwright, and others, sought to obtain

employs the term in its present accepted sense:
"Such a remedy might have wrought a radical
cure of the evil that threatens our constitution,"
etc. Wharton.

## RAFFLE

A kind of lottery in which several
persons pay, in shares, the value of something
put up as a stake, and then determine by chance
(as by casting dice) which one of them shall be-
come the sole possessor of it. Webster; Prender-
gast v. State, 41 Tex.Cr.R. 358, 57 S.W. 850. Peo-
ple v. American Art Union, 7 N.Y. 241.
signed by Edward I. and his council, to go a cir-

men, or precedent.
RAGMAN'S ROLL, or RAGIMUND'S ROLL. A
roll, called from one Ragimund or Ragimont, a
legate in Scotland, who, summoning all the bene-
ficed clergymen in that kingdom, caused them on
oath to give in the true value of their benefices,
according to which they were afterwards taxed by
the court of Rome. Wharton.

## RAIL CHAIR

them the effect of being one continuous rail. Rail-
road Supply Co. v. Hart Steel Co., C.C.A.I11., 222
F. 261, 269.

conveyance of heavy loads in cars or carriages
propelled by steam or other motive power; a road
or way on which iron rails are laid for transpor-
tation purposes, as incident to the possession or
ownership of which important franchises and
rights affecting the public are attached. A rail-
way. New Deemer Mfg. Co. v. Kilpatrick, 129
Miss. 268, 92 So. 71, 73; Muskogee Electric Trac-
tion Co. v. Doering, 70 Okl. 21, 172 P. 793, 794, 2
A.L.R. 94. An enterprise created and operated to
carry on a fixed track passengers and freight, or
passengers or freight, for rates or tolls, without
discrimination as to those who demand trans-
portation. Bradley v. Degnon Contracting Co.,
224 N.Y. 60, 120 N.E. 89, 91. In a strictly accu-
rate sense, it is a generic term, and includes all
kinds of railroads, whether street railways, horse
car lines, cable car lines, electric trolley lines,
suburban lines, interurban lines, or steam rail-
roads engaged in general transportation. In re
Columbia Ry., Gas & Electric Co., D.C.S.C., 24
F.2d 828, 831.
The term "railroad" or "railway" may in a broad sense
include all structures which are necessary to operation of
railroad. Smith v. Northern Pac. Ry. Co., 50 Mont. 539,
148 P. 393, 394.
Whether or not "railroad" includes roads operated by
horse-power, electricity, cable-lines, etc., will generally de-
pend upon the context of the statute in which it is found.
The decisions on this point are at variance. Frisco Lumber
Co. v. Spivey, 40 Okl. 633, 140 P. 157, 158; Morgan v.
Grande Ronde Lumber Co., 76 Or. 440, 148 P. 1122, 1123.
If scope of a statute relating to railroads shows that both
railroads and street railroads were within the legislative
contemplation, the word "railroad" will include street rail-
roads; but, if act was aimed at railroads proper, street
railroads are excluded from its provisions. In re Columbia
Ry., Gas & Electric Co., D.C.S.C., 24 F.2d 828, 831.
Railroad is usually limited to roads for heavy steam
transportation and also to steam roads partially or wholly
electrified or roads for heavy traffic designed originally
and the like are usually termed railways. In Great Britain
and the British colonies, except Canada, all such roads,
whether for heavy or light traffic, are usually called rail-
ways. Webster, Diet.
See, also, Railway.
Branch Railroad
A road connected with the main line, not as a
mere incident thereto, to facilitate the business
of the main line, but to do a business of its own
by transporting persons and property to and from
places not reached by the main line. Illinois Cent.
R. Co. v. East Sioux Falls Quarry Co., 33 S.D. 63,
144 N.W. 724, 726.
Railroad Car

road tracks. State v. Tardiff, 111 Me. 552, 90 A.
424, L.R.A.1915A, 817.
Railroad Commission
A body of commissioners, appointed in several
of the states, to regulate railway traffic within the
state, with power, generally, to regulate and fix
rates, see to the enforcement of police ordinances,
and sometimes assess the property of railroads for
taxation. Southern Pac. Co. v. Board of Railroad
Com'rs, C.C.Cal., 78 F. 236, 252.

ience in operation. Day v. Louisville & N. R. Co.,
295 Ky. 679, 175 S.W.2d 347, 349.
Railroad Line
A regular line of railroad vehicles for public
use operating between distant points or between
different cities. Bruce Transfer Co. v. Johnston,
227 Iowa 50, 287 N.W. 278, 280.
Railroad Property
The property which is essential to a railroad
company to enable it to discharge its functions
and duties as a common carrier by rail. It in-
cludes the road bed, right of way, tracks, bridges,
stations, rolling stock, and such like property.
Northern Pac. It. Co. v. Walker, C.C.N.D., 47 F.

contributions of corporation employees, or by
them jointly with the corporation, for the purpose
of providing relief to the employees in case of

## RAILWAY

In law, this term is usually of ex-
actly equivalent import to "railroad" (q. v.).
State v. Brin, 30 Minn, 522, 16 N.W. 406; Milivale
Borough v. Evergreen Ry. Co., 131 Pa. 1, 18 A.
993, 7 L.R.A. 369.
Interurban Railways
A sort of hybrid, having in some respects the
characteristics of the ordinary railroad and in oth-
ers those of the street railroad. Within the limits
of the cities which they enter, they usually pass
along the streets, and perform the ordinary func-
tions of street railroads, stopping where de-
sired to let passengers on or off, and serving
the public need for local street travel. Out-
side the cities, on their way from one city or
town to another, they frequently travel upon a
roadway obtained from private persons, not upon
a public road, and stop, as in case of ordinary
railroads, only at stations established by them for
that purpose. They also often convey freight as
well as passengers. San Francisco and S. M.
Electric Ry. Co. v. Scott, 142 Cal. 222, 75 P. 575,
576, 583.
Railway Commissioners
A body of three commissioners appointed under
the English regulation of railways act, 1873, prin-
cipally to enforce the provisions of the railway
and canal traffic act, 1854, by compelling railway
and canal companies to give reasonable facilities
for traffic, to abstain from giving unreasonable
preference to any company or person, and to for-
ward through traffic at through rates. They also
have the supervision of working agreements be-
tween companies. Sweet.
Railway Depot
A station at which trains stop for transaction of
ordinary business of railroad company, the re-
ceiving and delivering of freight and passengers.
Brenner v. Amrine, 151 Kan. 788, 100 P.2d 688, 690.
Street Railway
One constructed and operated on or along the
streets of a city or town to carry persons from one
point to another in such city or town, or to and
from its suburbs. It is peculiarly to accommodate
people in cities and towns; its tracks are ordinari-
ly laid to conform to street grades, its cars run
at short intervals, stopping at street crossings
to receive and discharge passengers, and its busi-
ness is confined to the carriage of passengers
and not freight. Muskogee Electric Traction Co.
v. Doehring, 70 Okl. 21, 172 P. 793, 795, 2 A.L.R.
94. An enterprise created and operated to carry
on a fixed track passengers and freight, or passen-
gers or freight, for rates or tolls, without discrim-
ination as to those who demand transportation.
Bradley v. Degnon Contracting Co., 224 N.Y. 60,
120 N.E. 89, 91. The term "street railroad" is
used interchangeably with "street railway." Met-
ropolitan West Side Electric Ry. Co. v. City of
Chicago, 261 Ill. 624, 104 N.E. 165, 167. The term
is sometimes distinguished from "railway," mean-
ing one of those larger institutions employed in
general freight and passenger traffic from one
city, town, or place to another, and usually denom-
inated "commercial railways," while a "street
railway" is built upon streets and avenues for the
accommodation of street traffic. Anhalt v. Water-
loo, C. F. & N. Ry. Co., 166 Iowa 479, 147 N.W.
928, 931. See Railroad. "Street railway" may in-
clude both urban and interurban lines. City of
Milwaukee v. Railroad Commission of Wisconsin,
169 Wis. 559, 173 N.W. 329, 330. See, also, Interur-
ban Railways.
Trunk Railway
A commercial railway connecting towns, cities,
counties, or other points within the state or in
different states, which has the legal capacity, un-
der its charter or the general law, of constructing,
purchasing, and operating branch lines or feeders
connecting with its main stem or trunk; the main
or trunk line bearing the same relation to its
branches that the trunk of a tree bears to its
branches, or the main stream of a river to its trib-
utaries. Oregon, C. & E. Ry. Co. v. Blackmer,
154 Or. 388, 59 P.2d 694, 696.
RAIN—WATER. The water which naturally falls
from the clouds.

## RAINY DAYS

Where a charter party (a cargo
of wheat) provided that rainy days should not be
counted as lay days, it excludes only rainy days
on which, with reference to the facilities of the
port in the way of covered docks, etc., the cargo
could not be safely landed. Kerr v. Schwaner,
101 C.C.A. 285, 177 F. 659.

## RAISE

To create; to infer; to create or bring
to light by construction or interpretation. To
cause or procure to be produced, bred or propa-
gated. To bring together; to get together or ob-
tain for use or service; to gather; to collect; to
levy; as to raise money to raise an army. Town
of Amherst v. Erie County, 256 N.Y.S. 785, 143
Misc. 540; Miller Hatcheries v. Boyer, C.C.A.
Iowa, 131 F.2d 283, 287.

## RAISE A PRESUMPTION

To give occasion or
ground for a presumption; to be of such a char-
acter, or to be attended with such circumstances,
as to justify an inference or presumption of law.
Thus, a person's silence, in some instances, will
"raise a presumption" of his consent to what is
done.

## RAISE AN ISSUE

To bring pleadings to an is-
sue; to have the effect of producing an issue be-
tween the parties pleading in an action.

## RAISE REVENUE

To levy a tax, as a means
of collecting revenue; to bring together, collect,
or levy revenue. The phrase does not imply an
increase of revenue. Perry County v. Selma, etc.,
R. Co., 58 Ala. 557.

## RAISING A PROMISE

The act of the law in
extracting from the facts and circumstances of a
particular transaction a promise which was im-
plicit therein, and postulating it as a ground of
legal liability.

## RAISING A USE

Creating, establishing, or call-
veyed land to another in fee, without any con-
sideration, equity would presume that he meant
it to be to the use of himself, and would, there-
fore, raise an implied use for his benefit. Brown.
RAISING AN ACTION, in Scotland, is the insti-
tution of an action or suit.

## RAISING MONEY

Realizing money by subscrip-
tion, loan, or otherwise. New York & R. Cement
Co. v. Davis, 173 N.Y. 235, 66 N.E. 9; New London
Literary Inst. v. Prescott, 40 N.H. 333.

## RAISING PORTIONS

When a landed estate is
settled on an eldest son, it is generally burdened
with the payment of specific sums of money in
favor of his brothers and sisters. A direction
to this effect is called a direction for "raising
portions for younger children;" and, for this pur-
pose, it is usual to demise or lease the estate to
trustees for a term of years, upon trust to raise
the required portions by a sale or mortgage of
the same. Mozley & Whitley.
RAN, Sax. In Saxon and old English law. Open
theft, or robbery.

## RANCHO

Sp. A small collection of men or
their dwellings; a hamlet. As used, however, in.
Mexico and in the Spanish law formerly prevail-
ing in California, the term signifies a ranch or
large tract of land suitable for grazing purposes
where horses or cattle are raised, and is distin-
guished from hacienda, a cultivated farm or plan-
tation.

## RANCID

Having a rank smell or taste from
chemical change or decomposition. Spry v. Kiser,
179 N.C. 417, 102 S.E. 708, 709.
RAND, or RAND LIFT. In the nomenclature of
the • art of building heels, the cup-shaped piece

tion, to correspond in direction or line, or to trend
or run. Lilly v. Marcum, 214 Ky. 514, 283 S.W.
1059, 1060.

## RANGE

In the government survey of the
United States, one of the divisions of a state, a
row or tier of townships as they appear on the
map.
A tract or district of land within which domes-
tic animals in large numbers range for subsist-
ence; an extensive grazing ground. The term is
used on the great plains of the United States to
designate a tract commonly of many square miles
occupied by one or different proprietors and dis-
tinctively called a cattle range, stock range, or
sheep range. The animals on a range are usually
left to take care of themselves during the whole
year without shelter, except when periodically
gathered in a round-up for counting and selection,
and for branding, when the herds of several pro-
prietors run together. State v. Omaechevviaria,
27 Idaho, 797, 152 P. 280, 282; Missoula Trust &
Savings Bank v. Northern Pac. Ry. Co., 76 Mont.
201, 245 P. 949, 951.

## RANGER

In forest law. A sworn officer of the
forest, whose office chiefly consists in three points:
To walk daily through his charge to see, hear,
and inquire as well of trespasses as trespassers
in his bailiwick; to drive the beasts of the forest,
both of venery and chace, out of the deafforested
into the forested lands; and to present all tres-
passers of the forest at the next courts holden
for the forest. Cowell.

## RANK

Grade of official standing. The order
or place in which certain officers are placed in the
army and navy, in relation to others. Wood v.
U. S., 15 Ct.C1. 158.
Rank is often used to express something different from
office. It then becomes a designation or title of honor, dig-
nity, or distinction conferred upon an officer in order to fix
his relative position in reference to other officers in mat-
ters of privilege, precedence, and sometimes of command,
or by which to determine his pay and emoluments. This is
the case with the staff officers of the army. Wood v. U. S.,
15 Ct.C1. 159.
RANK, adj. In English law. Excessive; too
large in amount; as a rank modus. 2 Bl.Comm.

## RANKING OF CREDITORS

The Scotch term
for the arrangement of the property of a debtor
according to the claims of the creditors, in con-
sequence of the nature of their respective securi-
ties. Bell. The corresponding process in England
is the marshalling of securities in a suit or action
for redemption or foreclosure. Paterson.

## RANSOM

The money, price, or consideration
paid or demanded for redemption of a captured
person or persons, a payment that releases from
captivity. Acts 1933, c. 16063. Keith v. State, 120
Fla. 847, 163 So. 136.
In international law. The redemption of cap-
tured property from the hands of an enemy, par-
ticularly of property captured at sea. 1 Kent,
Comm. 104. A sum paid or agreed to be paid for
the redemption of captured property. 1 Kent,
Comm. 105.
Strictly speaking, not a recapture of the captured prop-
erty. It is rather a purchase of the right of the captors at
the time, be it what it may; or, more properly, it is a
relinquishment of all the interest and benefit which the
captors might acquire or consummate in the property, by
a regular adjudication of a prize tribunal, whether it be an
interest in 'rem, a lien, or a mere title to expenses. In this
respect, there seems to be no difference between the case
of a ransom of an enemy or a neutral. Maisonnaire v.
Keating, 2 Gall. 325, Fed.Cas.No.8,978.
In old English law. A sum of money paid for
the pardoning of some great offense. The dis-
tinction between ransom and amerciament is said
to be that ransom was the redemption of a cor-
poral punishment, while amerciament was a fine
or penalty directly imposed, and not in lieu of an-
other punishment. Cowell; 4 Bl.Comm. 380; U.
S. v. Griffin, 6 D.C. 57. A sum of money paid for
the redemption of a person from captivity or im-
prisonment. Thus one of the feudal "aids" was
to ransom the lord's person if taken prisoner. 2
Bl.Comm. 63.
vessel, in consideration of her release and of safe-
conduct for a stipulated course and time, agrees
to pay a certain sum as ransom.

## RAPE

In criminal law. The unlawful carnal
knowledge of a woman by a man forcibly and
against her will. Gore v. State, 119 Ga. 418, 46
S.E. 671, 100 Am.St.Rep. 182; People v. Cieslak,
319 Ill. 221, 149 N.E. 815, 816. State ex rel. Moffitt
v. Zupnik, Ohio App., 50 N.E.2d 427, 429. That is,
without her consent and against her utmost re-
sistance. State v. Cottengim, Mo., 12 S.W.2d 53,
Hence, if she consent to the sexual intercourse,
although that consent may be reluctantly given,
and although there may be some force used to
obtain her consent, the offense cannot be "rape."
Opposition to the sexual act by mere words is
not sufficient. Welch v. State, 58 Ga.App. 447,
198 S.E. 810, 811. While slightest penetration is
sufficient, it must be shown that private parts of
male entered at least to some extent in those of
female, and emission without penetration is in-
sufficient. Kitchen v. State, 61 Okl.Cr. 435, 69
P.2d 411, 415.
Under modern statutes which often materially
change the common-law definition and create an
offense commonly known as "statutory rape,"
where the offense consists in having sexual inter-
course with a female under statutory age, the
offense may be either with or without the female's
consent. State v. Ellison, 19 N.M. 428, 144 P. 10,
In English law. An intermediate division be-
tween a shire and a hundred; or a division of a
county, containing several hundreds. 1 Bl.Comm.
116; Cowell. Apparently peculiar to the county
of Sussex. See, however, Lath.

## RAPE OF THE FOREST

In old English law.
Trespass committed in a forest by violence. Cow-
ell.
RAPE-REEVE, In English law. The chief of-
ficer of a rape, (q. v.) . 1 Bl.Comm. 116.

## RAPINE

The felonious taking of another man's
personal property, openly and by violence, against
his will.
In the civil law, rapina is defined as the forcible
and violent taking of another man's movable
property with the criminal intent to appropriate
it to the robber's own use. A prmtorian action lay
for this offense, in which quadruple damages were
recoverable. Gaius, lib. 3, § 209; Inst. 4, 2; Mac-
keld. Rom. Law, § 481; Heinecc. Elem. § 1071.

## RAPPORT A SUCCESSION

In French law and
in Louisiana. A proceeding similar to hotchpot;
the restoration to the succession of such property
as the heir may have received by way of advance-
ment from the decedent, in order that an even
division may be made among all the co-heirs.
Civ.Code La. art. 1227.

## RAPTOR

In old English law. A ravisher. Fle-
ta, lib. 2, c. 52, § 12,
for taking away an heir holding in socage, of
which there were two sorts: One when the heir
was married; the other when he was not. Reg.
Orig. 163.

## RAPUIT

Lat. In old English law. Ravished.
A technical word in old indictments. 2 East, 30.

## RASURE

The act of scraping, scratching, or
shaving the surface of a written instrument, for
the purpose of removing certain letters or words
from it. It is to be distinguished from "oblitera-
tion," as the latter word properly denotes the
crossing out of a word or letter bT, drawing a line
through it with ink. But the two expressions
are often used interchangeably. Penny v. Cor-
withe, 18 Johns., N.Y. 499.

## RASUS

In old English law. A rase; a measure
of onions, containing twenty Hones, and each flon-
is twenty-five heads. Fleta, lib. 2, c. 12, § 12.

## RATABLE

Proportional; proportionately rated
upon a constant ratio adjusted to due relation.
Glucksman v. Board of Education of City of New
York, Mun.Ct., 164 N.Y.S. 351, 359. According to
a measure which fixes proportions. It has no
meaning unless referable to some rule or stan-
dard, and never means equality or equal division
but implies unequal division as between different
persons. Chenoweth v. Nordan & Morris, Tex.
Civ.App., 171 S.W.2d 386, 387.

## RATABLE ESTATE OR PROPERTY

Property
in its quality and nature capable of being rated,
e. appraised, assessed. 10 B. & S. 323; Coventry
Co. v. Assessors, 16 R.I. 240, 14 A. 877; Burdick
v. Pendleton, 46 R.I. 125, 125 A. 278, 279. Tax-
able estate; the real and personal property which
the legislature designates as "taxable." Marsh-
field v. Middlesex, 55 Vt. 546.

## RATAM REM HABERE

Lat. In the civil law.
To hold a thing ratified; to ratify or confirm it.
Dig. 46, 8, 12, 1.

## RATE

Proportional or relative value, measure,
or degree; the proportion or standard by which
quantity or value is adjusted. Shropshire v. Com-
merce Farm Credit Co., Tex.Civ.App., 266 S.W.
612, 614.
Thus, the rate of interest is the proportion or ratio be-
tween the principal and interest. So the buildings in a
town are rated for insurance purposes; i. e., classified and
individually estimated with reference to their insurable
qualities. In this sense also we speak of articles as being
in "first-rate" or "second-rate" condition.
A fixed relation of quantity, amount or degree; also, a
charge, valuation, payment or price fixed according to ra-
tio, scale or standard; comparative price or amount of
demands. E. C. Miller Cedar Lumber Co. v. United States,
Cust. & Pat.App., 86 F.2d 429, 434. Webster.
Thus, we speak of the rate at which public lands are
sold, rates of fare upon railroads, etc. Georgia R. & B.
Co. v. Maddox, 116 Ga. 64, 42 S.E. 315; Naylor v. Board of
Education of Fulton County, 216 Ky. 766, 288 S.W. 690, 692.
In connection with public utilities, a charge to
the public for a service open to all and upon the
same terms. State v. Spokane & I. E. R. Co., 89
Wash. 599, 154 P. 1110, 1113, L.R.A.1918C, 675;

As used in the interstate commerce law, it
means the net cost to the shipper of the trans-

amount the carrier receives from the shipper and
retains. Elliott v. Empire Natural Gas Co., 123

The term is also used as the synonym of "tax;"
that is, a sum assessed by governmental authority
upon persons or property, by proportional valua-
tion, for public purposes. It is chiefly employed
in this sense in England, but is there usually con-
fined to taxes of a local nature, or those raised by
the parish; such as the poor-rate, borough rate,
etc.
It sometimes occurs in a connection which gives
it a meaning synonymous with "assessment;" that
is, the apportionment of a tax among the whole
number of persons who are responsible for it, by
estimating the value of the taxable property of
each, and making a proportional distribution of
the whole amount. Thus we speak of "rating"
persons and property.
In marine insurance, the term refers to the
classification or scaling of vessels based on their
relative state and condition in regard to insur-
able qualities; thus, a vessel in the best possible
condition and offering the best risk from the un-
derwriter's standpoint, is "rated" as "A 1." Insur-
ance Companies v. Wright, 1 Wall. 472, 17 L.Ed.

railroads, and to be divided among them for the
service rendered by each respectively. Southern.

it will furnish certain services under certain con-
ditions for certain price. Union Wire Rope Cor-

Brev. 51.

er, 112 N.J.L. 413, 171 A. 149, 151; The adoption
by one, as binding upon himself, of an act done
in such relations that he may claim it as done for

stances as would not bind him except for his sub-
sequent assent. Samstag & Hilder Bros. v. Ot-
tenheimer & Weil, 90 Conn. 475, 97 A. 865, 867;

lates back to time when act ratified was done, ex-
cept where intervening rights of third persons

Cal.App. 86, 267 P. 711, 713.
In the law of principal and agent, the adoption
and confirmation by one person with knowledge of

Ratification of transaction involves same elements Its
making of new contract, and understanding of material
facts necessary to an intelligent assent is essential to "rati-
fication." State ex rel. Robertson v. Johnson County Bank,
18 Tenn.App. 232, 74 S.W.2d 1084, 1087.
Essence of "ratification" by principal of act of agent is
manifestation of mental determination by principal to af-
firm the act, and this may be manifested by written word
or by spoken word or by conduct, or may be inferred from
known circumstances and principal's acts in relation there-.
to. Miller v. Chatsworth Say. Bank, 203 Iowa, 411, 212
N.W. 722, 724.
To constitute ratification of voidable contract the act
relied on must be performed with full knowledge of its con-
sequences and with an express intention of ratifying what
is known to be voidable. Coe v. Moon, 260 Ill. 76, 102 N.E.
1074, 1076; Fletcher v. A. W. Koch Co., Tex.Civ.App., 189
S.W. 501, 503.

rect terms of assent. Implied ratifications are such as the

ity & Deposit Co. of Maryland, 149 Minn. 171, 182
N.W. 1008, 1009.
Though sometimes used synonymously, from a strictly
lexical standpoint, the word "adopt" should be used to
apply to void transactions, while the word "ratify" should
be limited to the final approval of a voidable transaction
by one who theretofore had the optional right to relieve
himself from its obligations. Cosden Oil & Gas Co. v. Hen-
drickson, 96 Okl. 206, 221 P. 86, 89.

ch. XVI, § XXV.
The change of government from a monarchy
to a republic was treated as not terminating
treaties, nor a successful revolution; nor an al-
liance of one of the treaty powers with a third
power. As the result, however, of the changes in
the state of Europe effected by the wars of Na-
poleon, all the treaties of the United States with
European powers were considered as terminated,
excepting only one with Spain of 1795. 5 Moore,
Dig. Int. L. 335, 337, 338.

## REBUT

a claim. Co. Litt. 365a; Termes de la Ley.

chy, 25 So. 109, 51 La.Ann. 228.
Also evidence given in opposition to a presumption of

only counteracting evidence, but evidence sufficient to
counteract, that is, conclusive. Fain v. Cornett, 25 Ga. 186.

and apply or dispose of them at the direction of
the court when it does not seem reasonable that
either party should hold them. Or where a par-
ty is incompetent to do so, as in the case of an
infant. The remedy of the appointment of a re-
ceiver is one of the very oldest in the court of
chancery, and is founded on the inadequacy of the
remedy to be obtained in the court of ordinary
jurisdiction. Bisp. Eq. § 576; In re Guaranty In-

generally. Brown.

evidence of debt, or debenture, issued by authority
of a court of chancery, as a first lien upon the

mined by the judgment in the action. Title Guar-
antee & Trust Co. v. 457 Schenectady Ave., 257 N.
Y.S. 413, 417, 235 App.Div. 509.

## RECHT

Ger. Right; justice; equity; the whole
body of law; unwritten law; law; also a right.
There is much ambiguity in the use of this term, an
ambiguity which it shares with the French "droit," the
Italian "diritto," and the English "right." On the one
hand, the term "Recht" answers to the Roman "jus," and
thus indicates law in the abstract, considered as the foun-
dation. of all rights, or the complex of underlying moral
principles which impart the character of justice to al: posi-
tive law, or give it an ethical content. Taken in this ab-
stract sense, the term may be an adjective, in which case
it is equivalent to the English "just," or a noun, in which
case it may be paraphrased by the expressions "justice,"
"morality," or "equity." On the other hand, it serves to
point out a right; that is, a power, privilege, faculty, or
demand, inherent in one person, and incident upon an-
other. In the latter signification "Recht" (or "droit," or
"diritto," or "right") is the correlative of "duty" or "ob-
ligation." In the former sense, it may be considered as
opposed to wrong, injustice, or the absence of law. The
word "Recht" has the further ambiguity that it is used in
contradistinction to "Gesetz," as "jus" is opposed to
"lex," or the unwritten law to enacted law. See Droit;
RECIDIVE. In French law. The state of an in-
dividual who having been convicted of a crime or
misdemeanor, commits one again. A relapse.
Dalloz.

## RECIDIVIST

## RECONCILIATION

The renewal of amicable re-
lations between two persons who had been at
enmity or variance; usually implying forgive-
ness of injuries on one or both sides. It is some-
times used in the law of divorce as a term synony-
mous or analogous to "condonation." Martin v.
Martin, 151 La-. 530, 92 So. 46, 48.

## RECONDUCTION

of a former lease; relocation. Dig. 19, 2, 13, 11;
Code Nap. arts. 1737-1740.

## RECONSTRUCT

To construct again, to rebuild,
either in fact or idea, or to remodel, to form again
or anew as in the imagination or to restore again
as an entity the thing which was lost or destroyed.
City of Seattle v. Northern Pac. Ry. Co., 12 Wash.
2d 247, 121 P.2d 382, 386.

## RECONSTRUCTION

Act of constructing again.
It presupposes the nonexistence of the thing to be
reconstructed, as an entity; that the thing before
existing has lost its entity. McCarty v. Boulevard
Com'rs of Hudson County, 91 N.J.Law, 137, 106 A.
219, 220; Miller Hatcheries v. Buckeye Incubator
Co., C.C.A.Mo., 41 F.2d 619:
Also the name commonly given to the process
of reorganizing, by acts of congress and executive
action, the governments of the states which had
passed ordinances of secession, and of re-estab-
lishing their constitutional relations to the na-
tional government, restoring their representation
in congress, and effecting the necessary changes
in their internal government, after the close of
the civil war. Black, Const. Law (3d Ed.) 48;
Texas v. White, 7 Wall. 700, 19 L.Ed. 227.

## RECONTINUANCE

Used to signify that a per-
son has recovered an incorporeal hereditament
of which he had been wrongfully deprived. Thus,
A. is disseised of a mannor, whereunto an ad-
vowson is appendant, an estranger [i. e., neither
A. nor the disseisor] usurries to the advowson;
if the disseisee [A.] enter into the mannor, the
advowson is recontinued again, which was sev-
ered by the usurpation. * * * And so note a
diversitie between a recontinuance and a remit-
ter; for a remitter cannot be properly, unless
there be two titles; but a recontinuance may be
where there is but one. Co. Litt. 363b; Sweet.

## RECONVENIRE

Lat. In the canon and civil
law. To make a cross-demand upon the actor, or
RECONVENTION. In the civil law. An action
by a defendant against a plaintiff in a former
action; a cross-bill or litigation.
The term is used in practice in the states of
Louisiana and Texas, derived from the reconven-
tio of the civil law. Reconvention is not identical
with set-off, but more extensive. Pacific Exp. Co.
v. Malin, 132 U.S. 531, 10 S.Ct. 166, 33 L.Ed. 450;
Suberville v. Adams, 47 La.Ann. 68, 16 So. 652;
Gimbel v. Gomprecht, 89 Tex. 497, 35 S.W. 470.

## RECONVENTIONAL DEMAND

Any plea by a
defendant which constitutes more than mere de-
fense and amounts to counterclaim. Alfonso v.
Ruiz, La.App., 2 So.2d 480, 483, 484.

## RECONVERSION

That imaginary process by
which a prior constructive conversion is annulled
and the property restored in contemplation of
equity to its original actual quality. Seagle v.
Harris, 214 N.C. 339, 199 S.E. 271, 273.

## RECONVEYANCE

It takes place where a mort-
gage debt is paid off, and the mortgaged property
is conveyed again to the mortgagor or his rep-
resentatives free from the mortgage debt. Sweet.

judicial proceedings are enrolled in parchment for a per-
petual memorial and testimony, which rolls are called the

below, (with the pleadings, offers, objections to
evidence, rulings of the court, exceptions, charge,

books or other transcripts. Hence, derivatively,
it means the aggregate of the various judicial
steps taken on the trial below, in so far as they
were taken, presented, or allowed in the formal
and proper manner necessary to put them upon
the record of the court. This is the meaning in
such phrases as "no error in the record," "con-
tents of the record," "outside the record," etc. Le

record has authority to fine and imprison for con-
tempt of its authority. 3 Broom & H. Comm. 21,

Record of nisi prius. In English law. An of-
ficial copy or transcript of the proceedings in an
action, entered on parchment and "sealed and
passed," as it is termed, at the proper office; it
serves as a warrant to the judge to try the cause,
and is the only document at which he can judicial-
ly look for information as to the nature of the

determining the existence or non-existence of a
record. When a record is asserted by one party
to exist, and the opposite party denies its exist-
ence under the form of a traverse that there is
no such record remaining in court as alleged, and
issue is joined thereon, this is called an "issue
of nul tiel record," and in such case the court
awards a trial by inspection and examination of
the record. Upon this the party affirming its
existence is bound to produce it in court on a day
given for the purpose, and, if he fails to do so,
judgment is given for his adversary. Co. Litt.

## RECORD, ESTOPPEL BY

An estoppel founded
upon matter of record; as a confession, or admis-
sion made in pleading in a court of record, which
precludes the party from afterwards contesting
the same fact in the same suit. Steph. Pl. 197.
It arises from or is founded upon the adjudication of
a competent court. Smith v. Urquhart, 129 Fla. 742, 176
So. 787, 789. Confessions or admissions made in pleadings
in a court of record, decrees, and other final determina-
tions work estoppels. Bradner v. Howard, 75 N.Y. 417;
Butterfield v. Smith, 101 U.S. 570, 25 L.Ed. 868; Denver
City Irr. & Water Co. v. Middaugh, 12 Colo. 434, 21 Pac.
565, 13 Am.St.Rep. 234. An "estoppel by record" is the
preclusion to deny the truth of a matter set forth in a rec-
ord, whether judicial or legislative, also to deny the facts
adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction. Swofford
Bros. Dry Goods Co. v. Owen, 37 Okl. 616, 133 P. 193, 198,
L.R.A.1916C, 189; Watson v. Goldsmith, 205 S.C. 215, 31
S.E.2d 317, 320.
An "estoppel by record" cannot be invoked where allega-
tions or recitals did not conclude pleader in prior proceed-
ing. Blackburn v. Blackburn, Tex.Civ.App., 163 S.W.2d
251, 255. It bars a second action between the same parties
on an issue necessarily raised and decided in the first ac-
tion. Woods v. Duval, 151 Kan. 472, 99 P.2d 804, 808. It
exists only as between the same parties, or those in privity
with them, in same case on same issues. Smith v. Maine,
260 N.Y.S. 425, 145 Misc. 521. The doctrine prevents a
party not only from litigating again what was actually
litigated iri the former case, but litigating what might have
been litigated therein. Kuchenreuther v. Chicago, M. St.
P. & P. R. Co., 225 Wis. 613, 275 N.W. 457.
Defense of res judicata a plea of "estoppel by record".

practice. A writ by which a suit or plaint in re-
plevin may be removed from a county court to
one of the courts of Westminster Hall. 3 Bl.
Comm. 149; 3 Steph. Pl. 522, 666. So termed
from the emphatic words of the old writ, by which
the sheriff was commanded to cause the plaint
to be recorded, and to have the record before the
superior court. Reg. Orig. 5b.

## RECORDATUR

In old English practice. An
entry made upon a record, in order to prevent any

A magistrate, in the judicial systems of some of
the states, who has a criminal jurisdiction anal-
ogous to that of a police judge or other commit-
ting magistrate, and usually a limited civil juris-
diction, and sometimes authority conferred by
statute in special classes of proceedings. Leige-
ber v. State, 17 Ala.App. 551, 86 So. 126; City of
Colton v. Superior Court in and for San Bernar-
dino County, 84 Cal.App. 303, 257 P. 909, 911.

ment of deeds and other legal instruments author-

on.

## RECORDING ACTS

Statutes enacted in the-sev-
eral states relative to the official recording of
deeds, mortgages, bills of sale, chattel mortgages,
etc., and the effect of such records as notice to
creditors, purchasers, incumbrancers, and others
interested.

## RECORDS, EARLY ENGLISH

A record com-
mission was appointed in 1800 by parliament,
which in 37 years of service printed many records
of England, Wales and Scotland. See their re-
ports. Extracts from that on the "Statutes of the
Realm" will be found in 2 Sel. Essays in Anglo.
Amer. L. H. 171. See 2 Holdsw. Hist. E. L.

## RECORDUM

A record; a judicial record. It is
used in the phrase prout patet per recordum,
which is a formula employed, in pleading, for
reference to a record, signifying as it appears
from the record. 1 Chit. Pl. 385; Philpot v. Mc-
Arthur, 10 Me. 127.
RECOUP, or RECOUPE. To deduct, defalk, dis-
count, set off, or keep back; to withhold part of
a demand.

## RECOUPMENT

In practice. Defalcation or dis-
count from a demand. A keeping back something
which is due, because there is an equitable reason
to withhold it. Tomlins. A right of the defend-
ant to have a deduction from the amount of the
plaintiff's damages, for the reason that the plain-
tiff has not complied with the cross-obligations or
independent covenants arising under the same
contract. Hoover Commercial Co. v. Humphrey,
107 Miss. 810, 66 So. 214, 216.
It implies that plaintiff has cause of action, but asserts
that defendant has counter cause of action growing out of
breach of some other part of same contract on which plain-
tiff's action is founded, or for some cause connected Ovith
contract. Marianna Lime Products Co. v. McKay, 109 Fla.
275, 147 So. 264, 267; Storrs v. Storrs, 130 Fla. 717, 178 So.
841, 843.
It is keeping back something which is due because there
is an equitable reason to withhold it; and is now uni-
formly applied where a man brings an action for breach of
a contract between him and the defendant; and where the
latter can show that some stipulation in the same contract
was made by the plaintiff, which he has violated, the de-
fendant may, if he choose, instead of suing in his turn,
recoupe his damages arising from the breach committed by
the plaintiff, whether they be liquidated or not. Ives v.
Van Eppes, 22 Wend., N.Y., 156. And see Barber v. Chap-
in, 28 Vt. 413.
In speaking of matters to be shown in defense, the term
"recoupment" is often used as synonymous with "reduc-
tion." The term is of French origin, and signifies cutting
again, or cutting back, and, as a defense, means the cut-
ting back on the plaintiff's claim by the defendant. Like
reduction, it is of necessity limited to the amount of the
plaintiff's claim. It is properly applicable to a case where
the same contract imposes mutual duties and obligations
on the two parties, and one seeks a remedy for the breach
of duty by the second, and the second meets the demand
by a claim for the breach of duty by the first. Davenport
v. Hubbard, 46 Vt. 207, 14 Am. Rep. 620.
"Recoupment" differs from "set-off" in this respect :
that any claim or demand the defendant may have against
the plaintiff may be used as a set-off, while it is not a
subject for recoupment unless it grows out of the very
same transaction which furnishes the plaintiff's cause of
action. The term is, as appears above, synonymous with
"reduction;" but the latter is not a technical term of the
law; the word "defalcation," in one of its meanings, ex-
presses the same idea, and is used interchangeably with
recoupment. Recoupment, as a remedy, corresponds to the
reconvention of the civil law. Dexter-Portland Cement Co.
v. Acme Supply Co., 147 Va. 758, 133 S.E. 788, 790; Lovett
v. Lovett, 93 Fla. 611, 112 So. 768, 780.
"Recoupment" is the right to set off unliquidated dam-
ages, while the right of "set-off," comprehends only
liquidated damages, or those capable of being ascertained
by calculation. Alley v. Bessemer Gas Engine Co., Tex.
Civ.App., 228 S.W. 963, 966. Recoupment is confined to
matters arising out of the transaction or contract upon
which suit is brought, not depending upon whether the
matter be liquidated or unliquidated. J. C. Lysle Milling
Co. v. North Alabama Grocery Co., 201 Ala. 222, 77 So. 748,
749. While there is a well-defined distinction between set-
off and recoupment, they are each, in a sense, set-offs.
Lehman v. Austin, 195 Ala. 244, 70 So. 653, 655.

## RECOURSE

ment, to obtain a favorable or final judgment, to
obtain in any legal manner in contrast to volun-
tary payment. Covert v. Randles, 53 Ariz. 225, 87
P.2d 488, 490. Olds v. General Acc. Fire and Life

him. This is also called a "true" recovery, to dis-
tinguish it from a "feigned" or "common" recov-
ery. See Common Recovery.
The obtaining of a thing by the judgment of a
court, as the result of an action brought for that
purpose. Vaughan v. Humphreys, 153 Ark. 140,

of any cause of divorce against the plaintiff, in bar
of the plaintiff's cause of divorce. Morrison v.
Morrison, 38 Idaho 45, 221 P. 156, 158. And to bar
divorce, complainant's misconduct need not be of
equal degree with that of defendant, but must be
of same general character. Carter v. Carter, Tex.
Civ.App., 151 S.W.2d 884, 885.

## RECRUIT

A newly-enlisted soldier.

## RECRUITING

Within 50 U.S.C.A. § 2388(a), de-
nouncing the offense of obstructing the "recruit-
ing or enlistment service," "recruiting" is gaining
fresh supplies for the forces, as well by draft as

ment or voluntary enrollment. U. S. v. Prieth,
D.C.N.J., 251 F. 946, 951.

## RECTIFICATION OF REGISTER

The process
by which a person whose name is wrongly en-
tered on (or omitted from) a register may com-

## RECTIFIER

As used in the United States in-
ternal revenue laws, this term is not confined to a
person who runs spirits through charcoal, but is
applied to any one who rectifies or purifies spirits
in any manner whatever, or who makes a mix-
ture of spirits with anything else, and sells it un-
der any name. Quantity of Distilled Spirits, 3
Ben. 73, Fed.Cas.No.11,494.
•RECTIFY. To correct or define something which
is erroneous or doubtful. Sweet.
Thus, where the parties to an agreement have deter-
mined to embody its terms in the appropriate and conclu-
sive form, but the instrument meant to effect this purpose
(e. g., a conveyance, settlement, etc.) is, by mutual mis-
take, so framed as not to express the real intention of the
parties, an action may be brought in the chancery division
of the high court to have it rectified. Sweet.

## RECTITUDO

Lat. Right or justice; legal dues;
tribute or payment. Cowell.

## RECTO, BREVE DE

A writ of right, which was
of so high a nature that as other writs in real ac-
tions were only to recover the possession of the
land, etc., in question, this aimed to recover the

gether. Cowell.

## RECTO DE ADVOCATIONE ECCLESUE

## REFER

When a case or action involves matters
of account or other intricate details which require
minute examination, and for that reason are not
fit to be brought before a jury, it is usual to refer
the whole case, or some part of it, to the decision
of an auditor or referee, and the case is then said
to be referred.
Taking this word in its strict, technical use, it relates
to a mode of determining questions which is distinguished
from "arbitration," in that the latter word imports sub-
mission of a controversy without any lawsuit having been
brought, while "reference" imports a lawsuit pending, and
an issue framed or question raised which (and not the con-
troversy itself) is sent out. Thus, arbitration is resorted
to instead of any judicial proceeding ; while reference is
one mode of decision employed in the course of a judicial
proceeding. And "reference" is distinguished from "hear-
ing or trial," in that these are the ordinary modes of
deciding issues and questions in and by the courts with aid
of juries when proper; while reference is an employment
of non-judicial persons—individuals not integral parts of
the court—for the decision of particular matters incon-
venient to be heard in actual court. Abbott.
To point, allude, direct, or make reference to.
This is the use of the word in conveyancing and

the purpose of directing the reader's attention to
another place in the deed, book, document, etc.,
is said to "refer" him to such other connection.

court in such cases and relieves the judge of at-
tention to matters of detail or routine, by taking

## REFEREES, COURT OF

In the passage of pri-
vate bills through the house of commons, the prac-
tice was adopted in 1864 of the appointment of
referees on such bills, consisting of the chairman
of ways and means and not less than three other
persons to be appointed by the speaker. The ref-
erees were formed into one or more courts, three
at least being required to constitute each court, a
member in every case being chairman, but re-
ceiving no salary. The referees inquired into the
proposed works, etc., and reported to the house.
The committees of the house on any bill might
also refer any question to the referees for their
decision. It was also ordered in 1864 that the ref-
erees should decide on all petitions as to the right
of the petitioner to be heard, i. e., his locus standi.
A court of referees was specially constituted for
the adjudication of this right, called locus standi.
A series of reports of the court of referees on
private bills in parliament, called Locus Standi
reports, has been published since 1867.

important legislative measure to a direct vote of
the whole people. Pacific States Telephone &
Telegraph Co. v. Oregon, 32 S.Ct. 224, 223 U.S.
118, 56 L.Ed. 377; Kiernan v. Portland, 32 Sup.Ct.
231, 223 U.S. 151, 56 L.Ed. 386; Plebiscite; In-
itiative. Right reserved to the people to adopt
or reject any act or measure which has been

Tenn. 134, 138 S.W.2d 445, 446.

## REFORM

To correct, rectify, amend, remodel.
Instruments inter partes may be reformed, when
defective, by a court of equity. By this is meant
that the court, after ascertaining the real and ori-

instrument, (which intention they failed to suffi-
fact, or inadvertence,) will decree that the instru-
ment be held and construed as if it fully and tech-
nically expressed that intention. Churchill v.
Meade, 92 Or. 626, 182 P. 368, 371; Gross v. Yeskel,

See, also, Reformation.
It is to be observed that "reform" Is seldom, if ever,
used of the correction of defective pleadings, judgments,
decrees or other judicial proceedings ; "amend" being the
proper term for that use. Again, "amend" seems to con-
note the idea of improving that which may have been well
enough before, while "reform" might be considered as
properly applicable only to something which before was
quite worthless.

right and power of having or doing something of
advantage, and declines it. Also, the declination
of a request or detnand, or the omission to comply
with some requirement of law, as the result of a
positive intention to disobey. In the latter sense,
the word is often coupled with "neglect," as if a
party shall "neglect or refuse" to pay a tax, file
an official bond, obey an order of court, etc. But
"neglect" signifies a mere omission of a duty,
which may happen through inattention, dilator-
iness, mistake, or inability to perform, while "re-
fusal" implies the positive denial of an applica-
tion or command, or at least a mental determina-
tion not to comply. U. S. v. Krafft, C.C.A.N.J.,

## RELATIO SEMPER FIAT UT VALEAT DISPOS- ITIO

Reference should always be had in such

6 Coke, 76.

## RELATION

A relative or kinsman; a person
connected by consanguinity. In re Spier's Estate,

Kampelmann, 273 Mo. 450, 200 S.W. 1075, 1077.
See, also, Relative.
The words "relatives" and "relations," in their primary
sense, are broad enough to include any one connected by
blood or affinity, even to the remotest degree, but where
used in wills, as defining and determining legar succession,
are construed to include only those persons who are enti-
tled to share in the estate as next of kin under the statute
of distributions. In re Trickett's Estate, 197 Cal. 20, 239
P. 406, 409; Wooten's Trustee v. Hardy, 221 Ky. 338, 298
S.W. 963, 967.

respect to each other, who are associated, whether by the
law, by their own agreement, or by kinship, in some social
status or union for the purposes of domestic life; as the
relation of guardian and ward, husband and wife, master
and servant, parent and child; so in the phrase "domestic
relations."
The doctrine of "relation" is that principle by which an
act done at one time is considered by a fiction of law to
have been done at some antecedent period. It is usually
applied where several proceedings are essential to com-
deed. The last proceeding which consummates. the con-
veyance is held for certain purposes to take effect by rela-
tion as of the day when the first proceeding was had.
Knapp v. AlOcander-Edgar Lumber Co., 237 U.S. 162, 35
S.Ct. 515, 517, 59 L.Ed. 894. And see U. S. v. Anderson, 194
U.S. 394, 24 S.Ct. 716, 48 L.Ed. 1035.
A recital, account, narrative of facts; informa-
tion given. Thus, suits by quo warranto are en-
titled "on the relation of" a private person, who
is called the "relator." But in this connection the
word seems also to involve the idea of the sug-
gestion, instigation, or instance of the relator.
In the civil law, the report of the facts and law
in a pending case, made by the judges to the em-
peror, for the purpose of obtaining his opinion
on the questions of law involved, in the form of an
imperial rescript. This proceeding might be re-
sorted to in cases where no law seemed applicable,
or where there were great difficulties in its inter-
pretation, until it was abolished by Justinian.
Nov. 125.

## RELEASE

The relinquishment, concession,
or giving up of a right, claim, or privilege, by the
person in whom it exists or to whom it accrues, to
the person against whom it might have been de-
manded or enforced. Miller v. Estabrook, C.C.A.
W.Va., 273 F. 143, 148; Coopey v. Keady, 73 Or.
66, 144 P. 99, 101.
In this sense it is a contract and must be supported by
lawful and valuable consideration. Hamilton v. Edmund-
son, 235 Ala. 97, 177 So. 743, 746.
A discharge of a debt by act of party, as distinguished
from an extinguishment which is a discharge by operation
of law, and, in distinguishing release from receipt, "re-
ceipt" is evidence that an obligation has been discharged,
but "release" is itself a discharge of it. Glickman v. Wes-
ton, 140 Or. 117, 11 P.2d 281, 284.
An express release is one directly made in terms by deed
or other suitable means. An implied release is one which
arises from acts of the creditor or owner, without any ex-
press agreement. Pothier, Obl. nn. .608, 609. A release bfj
operation of law is one which, though not expressly made,
the law presumes in consequence of some act of the re;
leasor ; for instance, when one of several joint obligors is
expressly released, the others are also released by opera-
tion of law. 3 Salk. 298; Rowley v. Stoddard, 7 Johns.,
N.Y., 207.

writ under the seal of the court, addressed to the
marshal, commanding him to release the nronerty.
Sweet.
Estates
The conveyance of a man's interest or right
which he hath unto a thing to another that hath
the possession thereof or some estate therein.
Shep. Touch. 320. The relinquishment of some
right or benefit to a person who has already some
interest in the tenement, and such interest as qual-
ifies him for receiving or availing himself of the
right or benefit so relinquished. Burt. Real Prop.
12; Field v. Columbet, 9 Fed.Cas. 13; Baker v.
Woodward, 12 Or. 3, 6 P. 173.
A conveyance of an ulterior interest in lands
or tenements to a particular tenant, or of an un-
divided share to a co-tenant, (the releasee being in
either case in privity of estate with the releasor,)
or of the right, to a person wrongfully in posses-
sion. 1 Steph.Comm. 479.
Deed of release. A deed operating by way of
release; but more specifically, in those states
where deeds of trust are in use instead of com-
mon-law mortgages, as a means of pledging real
property as security for the payment of a debt, a
"deed of release" is a conveyance in fee, execut-
ed by the trustee or trustees, to the grantor in the
deed of trust, which conveys back to him the legal
title to the estate, and which is to be given on sat-
isfactory proof that he has paid the secured debt
in full or otherwise complied with the terms of
the deed of trust.
Release by way of enlarging an estate. A con-
veyance of the ulterior interest in lands to the
particular tenant; as, if there be tenant for life
or years, remainder to another in fee, and he in
remainder releases all his right to the particular
tenant and his heirs, this gives him the estate in
fee 1 Steph.Comm. 480; 2 Bl.Comm. 324.
Release by way of entry and feoffment. As if
there be two joint disseisors, and the disseisee
releases to one of them, he shall be sole seised,
and shall keep out his former companion; which
is the same in effect as if the disseisee had entered
and thereby put an end to the disseisin, and after-
wards had enfeoffed one of the disseisors in fee.
2 Bl.Comm. 325.
Release by way of extinguishment. As if my
tenant for life makes a lease to A. for life, re-
mainder to B. and his heirs, and I release to A.,
this extinguishes my right to the reversion, and
shall inure to the advantage of B.'s remainder, as
well as of A.'s particular estate. 2 Bl.Comm. 325.
Release by way of passing a right. As if a man
be disseised and releaseth to his disseisor all his
right, hereby the disseisor acquires a new right,
which changes the quality of his estate, and ren-
ders that lawful which before was tortious or
wrongful. 2 Bl.Comm. 325.
Release by way of passing an estate. As, where
one of two coparceners releases all her right to
the other, this passes the fee-simple of the whole.
Release of dower. The relinquishment by a
married woman of her expectant dower interest
or estate in a particular parcel of realty belonging
to her husband, as, by joining with him in a con-
veyance of it to a third person.
Release to uses. The conveyance by a deed of
release to one party to the use of another is so
termed. Thus, when a conveyance of lands was
effected, by those instruments of assurance term-
ed a lease and release, from A. to B. and his heirs,
to the use of C. and his heirs, in such case C. at
once took the whole fee-simple in such lands; B.
by the operation of the statute of uses, being made
a mere conduit-pipe for conveying the estate to
C. Brown.

## RELEASEE

The person to whom a release is
made.
RELEASER, or RELEASOR. The maker of a
release.

## RELEGATIO

Lat. A kind of banishment known
to the civil law, which differed from "deportatio"
in leaving to the person his rights of citizenship.

## RELEGATION

In old English law. Banishment
for a time only. Co. Litt. 133.

## RELEVANCY

Applicability to the issue joined.
That quality of evidence which renders it proper-
ly applicable in determining the truth and falsity
of the matters in issue between the parties to a
suit. 1 Greenl.Ev. § 49. Two facts are said to be
relevant to each other when so related that ac-
cording to the common course of events, one ei-
ther taken by itself or in connection with other
facts, proves or renders probable the past, pres-
ent, or future existence or non-existence of the
other. Steph.Dig.Ev. art. 1. Katz v. Delohery
Hat Co., 97 Conn. 665, 112 A. 88, 93; Barnett v.
State, 104 Ohio St. 298, 135 N.E. 647, 650, 27 A.
L.R. 351.
Relevancy is that which conduces to the proof
of a pertinent hypothesis; a pertinent hypothesis
being one which, if sustained, would logically in-
fluence the issue. Whart.Ev. § 20; Hampton v.
State, 126 Tex.Cr.R. 211, 70 S.W.2d 1001.
In Scotch law, the relevancy is the justice or
sufficiency in law of the allegations of a party.
A plea to the relevancy is therefore analogous to
the demurrer of the English courts.
A distinction is sometimes taken between "logical" rele-
vancy and "legal" relevancy, the former being judged
merely by the standards of ordinary logic or the general
laws of reasoning, the latter by the strict and artificial
rules of the law with reference to the admissibility of evi-
dence. Hoag v. Wright, 54 N.Y.S. 658, 34 App.Div. 260.
Relevant evidence is such evidence as relates to, or bears
directly upon, the point or fact in issue, and proves or has
a tendency to prove the proposition alleged; evidence
which conduces to prove a pertinent theory in a case.
State v. O'Neil, 13 Or. 183, 9 P. 286; Moran v. Abbey, 58
Cal. 163, 168. 1 Whart.Ev. § 20. It does not mean evidence
addressed with positive directness to the point but that
which according to the common course of events either tak-
en by itself or in connection with other facts, proves or
renders probable the past, present or future existence or
nonexistence of the other. Seller v. Jenkins, 97 Ind. 430,
438 (quoting Steph.Ev. art. 1, and Best, Principles of Ev.
Relevancy of evidence does not depend upon the con-
clusiveness of the testimony offered, but upon its legiti-
mate tendency to establish a controverted fact. Interstate
Commerce Commission v. Baird, 24 S.Ct. 563, 194 U.S. 25,
48 L. Ed. 860; State v. Upson :162 Minn. 9, 201 N.W. 913,
RELEVANT. Applying to the matter in ques-
tion; affording something to the purpose.
Fact is relevant to another fact when, according to com-
mon course of events, existence of one taken alone or in
connection with the other fact renders existence of the
other certain or more probable. Gulf, C. & S. F. Ry. Co.
v. Downs, Tex.Civ.App., 70 S.W.2d 318, 322.
In Scotch law, good in law, legally sufficient;
as, a "relevant" plea or defense.

## RELEVANT EVIDENCE

## RELIABLE

Trustworthy, 'worthy of confidence.
Quinn v. Daly, 300 Ill. 273, 133 N.E. 290, 291.

## RELICT

The survivor of a pair of married peo-
ple, whether the survivor is the husband or the

Deliverance from oppression, wrong, or injus-
tice.
In this sense it is used as a general designation of the
assistance, redress, or benefit which a complainant seeks
at the hands of a court, particularly in equity. It may be
thus used of such remedies as specific performance, or the
reformation or rescission of a contract; but it does not
seem appropriate to the awarding of money damages.
In feudal law. A sum payable by the new ten-
ant, the duty being incident to every feudal ten-
ure, by way of fine or composition with the lord
for taking up the estate which was lapsed or
fallen in by the death of the last tenant. At one

the relief of a knight's fee became fixed at one
hundred shillings. 2 Bl.Comm. 65.

cording to the dictates of one's conscience, but
also the right to do, or forbear to do, any act, for
conscience sake, the doing or forbearing of which

mission from heaven, or terrify and abuse the
people with false denunciations of judgment; they
are punishable with fine, imprisonment, and in-
famous corporal punishment. 4 Broom & H.
Comm. 71.

## RELIGIOUS LIBERTY

See Liberty.

## RELIGIOUS MEN

Such as entered into some

ciated together for the purpose of maintaining

renewal of a lease; a tacit relocation is permitting
a tenant to hold over without any new agreement.
In mining law. A new or fresh location of an
abandoned or forfeited mining claim by a stran-

## REMAINDER

The remnant of an estate in land,
depending upon a particular prior estate created
at the same time and by the same instrument, and
limited to arise immediately on the determination
of that estate, and not in abridgement of it. 4
Kent, Comm. 197; Bean v. Atkins, 87 Vt. 376, 89
A. 643, 646; Pinnell v. Dowtin, 224 N.C. 493, 31
S.E.2d 467, 469.
An estate limited to take effect and be enjoyed after
another estate is determined. As, if a man seised in fee-
simple grants lands to A. for twenty years, and, after the
determination of the said term, then to B. and his heirs
forever, here A. is tenant for years, remainder to B. in fee.
2 Bl.Comm. 164.
An estate in reversion is the residue of an estate, usually
the fee left in the grantor and his heirs after the deter-
mination of a particular estate which he has granted out
of it. The rights of the reversioner are the same as those
of a vested remainderman in fee. Sayward v. Sayward, 7
Me. 213, 22 Am.Dec. 191; Glenn v. Holt, Tex.Civ.App., 229
S. W. 684, 685.
In wills. The terms rest, residue, and remainder of es-
tate are usually and ordinarily understood as meaning that
part of the estate which is left after all of the other pro-
visions of the will have been satisfied. In re Vail's Estate,
223 Iowa 551, 273 N.W. 107, 110.
Contingent Remainder
An estate in remainder which is limited to take
effect either to a dubious and uncertain person, or
upon a dubious and uncertain event, by which no
present or particular interest passes to the re-
mainder-man, so that the particular estate may
chance to be determined and the remainder never
take effect. 2 Bl.Comm. 169. A remainder limited
so as to depend upon an event or condition which
may never happen or be performed, or which may
not happen or be performed till after the deter-
mination of the preceding estate. Fearne, Rem. 3;
Thompson v. Adams, 205 Ill. 552, 69 N.E. 1; Gris-

Cross-Remainder
Where land is devised or conveyed to two or
more persons as tenants in common, or where
different parts of the same land are given to such
persons in severalty, with such limitations that,
upon the determination of the particular estate
of either, his share is to pass to the other, to the
entire exclusion of the ultimate remainder-man
or reversioner until all the particular estates shall
be exhausted, the remainders so limited are called
"cross-remainders." In wills, such remainders may
arise by implication; but, in deeds, only by ex-
press limitation. 2 Bl.Comm. 381; 2 Washb. Real
Prop. 233; 1 Prest.Est. 94.
Executed Remainder
A remainder which vests a present interest in
the tenant, though the enjoyment is postponed to
the future. 2 Bl.Comm. 168; Fearne, Rem. 31;
Hudson v. Wadsworth, 8 Conn. 359.
Executory Remainder
A contingent remainder; one which exists
where the estate is limited to take effect either to
a dubious and uncertain person or upon a dubious
and uncertain event. Temple v. Scott, 143 Ill.
290, 32 N.E. 366.
Vested Remainder
An estate by which a present interest passes to
the party, though to be enjoyed in futuro, and by
which the estate is invariably fixed to remain to
a determinate person after the particular estate
has been spent. Pinnell v. Dowtin, 224 N.C. 493,
31 S.E.2d 467, 469. One limited to a certain per-
son at a certain time or upon the happening of
a necessary event. Etna Life Ins. Co. v. Hop-
'
pin, 214 F. 928, 933, 131 C.C.A. 224.
REMAINDER TO A PERSON NOT OF A CA-
PACITY TO TAKE AT THE TIME OP APPOINT-
ING IT, IS VOID. Plowd. 27.

## REMAINDER VESTED SUBJECT TO BEING DIVESTED

A remainder given to one person,
with proviso that it shall go to another under
certain contingencies. In re Barnes' Estate, 279
N.Y.S. 117, 155 Misc. 320.

## REMAINDERMAN

remainder of the estate after a particular estate
carved out of it has expired. In re Mawhinney's

action on it there.
Prisoner

court or magistrate, is to send him back to cus-
tody, to be kept until the hearing is resumed or
the trial comes on. Ex parte Chalfant, 81 W.Va.
93, 93 S.E. 1032, 1033.
When a prisoner is brought before a judge on habeas
corpus, for the purpose of obtaining liberty, the judge
hears the case, and either discharges him or remands him.

practice. The return made by the sheriff to a
writ of execution when he has not been able to
sell the property seized, that the same remains
unsold for want of buyers.

## REMANENTIA

In old English law. A remain-
der. Spelman. A perpetuity, or perpetual estate.
Glan. lib. 7, c. 1.

## REMANET

A remnant; that which remains.
Thus the causes of which the trial is deferred
from one term to another, or from one sitting to
another, are termed "remanets." 1 Archb.Pr. 375.

## REMEDIAL

Affording a remedy; giving the
means of obtaining redress. Of the nature of a
remedy; intended to remedy wrongs or abuses,
abate faults, or supply defects. Pertaining to or
affecting the remedy, as distinguished from that
which affects or modifies the right.

## REMEDIAL ACTION

One which is brought to
obtain compensation or indemnity. Cummings v.
Board of Education of Oklahoma City, 190 Okl.

## REMEDIAL STATUTE

One that intends to af-
ford a private remedy to a person injured by the
wrongful act. That is designed to correct an ex-
isting law, redress an existing grievance, or in-
troduce regulations conducive to the public good.
In re School Dist. No. 6, Paris and Wyoming Tps.,
Kent County, 284 Mich. 132, 278 N.W. 792, 797;
Bowles v. Trowbridge, D.C.Cal., 60 F.Supp. 48, 49.
A statute giving a party a mode of remedy for
a wrong, where he had none, or a different one,
before. 1 Chit.B1. 86, 87, notes; In re Ungaro's
Will, 88 N.J.Eq. 25, 102 A. 244, 246; Cherry v.
Kennedy, 144 Tenn. 320, 232 S.W. 661, 662.
The underlying test to be applied in determining wheth-
er a statute is penal or remedial is whether it primarily
seeks to impose an arbitrary, deterring punishment upon
any who might commit a wrong against the public by a
violation of the requirements of the statute, or whether the
purpose is to measure and define the damages which may
accrue to an individual or class of individuals, as just and
reasonable compensation for a possible loss having a causal
connection with the breach of the legal obligation owing
under the statute to such individual or class. Southern Ry.
Co. v. Melton, 133 Ga. 277, 291, 307, 65 S.E. 665. In re
Engel's Estate, 250 N.Y.S. 648, 653, 140 Misc. 276. Reme-
dial statutes are those which are made to supply such de-
fects, and abridge such superfluities, in the common law,
as arise either from the general imperfection of all human
laws, from change of time and circumstances, from the
mistakes and unadvised determinations of unlearned (or
even learned) judges, or from any other cause whatsoever.
1 B1.Comm. 86; Falls v. Key, Tex.Civ.App., 278 S.W. 893,
896; Columbus Trust Co. v. Upper Hudson Electric & R.
Co., Sup., 190 N.Y.S. 737, 739. These remedial statutes are
themselves divided into enlarging statutes, by which the
common law is made more comprehensive and extended
than it was before, and into restraining statutes, by which
it is narrowed down to that which is just and proper. A
remedial statute is one which not only remedies defects in,
the common law but defects in civil jurisprudence gen-
erally. M. H. Vestal Co. v. Robertson, 277 Ill. 425, 115
N.E. 629, 631; MacDonald v. Hamilton B. Wills & Co., 199
App. Div. 203, 191 N.Y.S. 566, 568.

18 Vin.Abr. 521.

## REMEDY

forced or the violation of a right is prevented, re-
dressed, or compensated. Remedies are of four

cipal of which are defense, recaption, distress, en-
try, abatement, and seizure; (2) by operation of
law, as in the case of retainer and remitter; (3)
by agreement between the parties, e. g., by accord
and satisfaction and arbitration; and (4) by ju-
dicial remedy, e. g., action or suit. Sweet. Berry
v. M. F. Donovan & Sons, 120 Me. 45'7,115 A. 250,
252, 25 A.L.R. 1021; California Prune & Apricot

entis v. Luckenbach S. S. Co., 38 S.Ct. 501, 503, 247
U.S. 372, 62 L.Ed. 1171.
Strictly speaking, "remedy" is no part of the action, but
is the result thereof, the object for which the action is pre-
sented, the end to which all the litigation is directed.
Mathews v. Sniggs, 75 Okl. 108, 182 P. 703, 707.
Remedies for the redress of injuries are either public, by
indictment, when the injury to the individual or to his
property affects the public, or private, when 'the tort is

Legal Remedy
A remedy available, under the particular cir-
cumstances of the case, in a court of law, as dis-
tinguished from a remedy available only in equity.
See State v. Sneed,. 105 Tenn. 711, 58 S.W. 1070.
Remedy Over
A person who is primarily liable or responsible,
but who, in turn, can demand indemnification
from another, who is responsible to him, is said
to have a "remedy over." For example, a city,
being compelled to pay for injuries caused by a
defect in the highway, has a "remedy over"
against the person whose act or' negligence caus-
ed the defect, and such person is said to be "li-
able over" to the city. 2 Black, Judgm. § 575.

## REMEMBRANCER

liamentary solicitor to the corporation, and bound
to attend all courts of aldermen and common
council when required. Pull.Laws & Cust.Lond.

of events is so broken that they become independent, and
final result cannot be said to be the natural and probable
consequence of the primary cause, the negligence of de-

ary. Dig. 17, 1, 7.
A quid pro quo. If a man gives his services, whatever
consideration he gets for giving his services seems to me a
remuneration for them. Consequently, I think, if a per-
son was in the receipt of a payment, or in the receipt of a
percentage, or any kind of payment which would not be an
actual money payment, the amount he would receive an-
nually in respect of this would be "remuneration." 1 Q.B.

bell River Timber Co. v. Vierhus, C.C.A.Wash., 86
F.2d 673, 675, 108 A.L.R. 763.
There is clear distinction between stipulation to "renew"
lease for additional term and one to "extend," in that

stipulates that the latter shall hold it as owner, but re-
serving to the former an annual rent of a certain sum o

nual interest. It is this interest which is called
"rente." Duverger. The word is therefore nearly
synonymous with the English "annuity."
RENTE FONCIERE. A rent which issues out of

## RENTE VIAGERE

That species of rente, the
duration of which depends upon the contingency
of the death of one or more persons indicated

contracts. Duverger. Civ.Code La. art. 2793 de-
fines the contract of annuity as that by which

When, after issue has been joined

Personal Replevin
A species of action to replevy a man out of
prison or out of the custody of any private per-

replegiando; but, as a means of examining into
the legality of an imprisonment, it is now super-
seded by the writ of habeas corpus.
Replevin Bond
A bond executed to indemnify the officer who
executed a writ of replevin and to indemnify the
defendant or person from whose custody the prop-

• REPLICATION. In pleading. A reply made by
the plaintiff in an action to the defendant's plea,
or in a suit in chancery to the defendant's answer.
General and Special
In equity practice, a general replication is a
general denial of the truth of defendant's plea or
answer, and of the sufficiency of the matter al-
leged in it to bar the plaintiff's suit, and an asser-
tion of the truth and sufficiency of the bill. A
special replication is occasioned by the defendant's
introducing new matter into his plea or answer,
which makes it necessary for the plaintiff to put
in issue some additional fact on his part in avoid-
ance of such new matter. James v. Lawson, 103
W.Va. 165, 136 S.E. 851, 853.

## REPLY

In its general sense, that what the plain-
tiff, petitioner, or other person who has instituted
a proceeding says in answer to the defendant's
case. Sweet. Its office is to join issue or avoid
new matter in answer, and not to aid complaint
by supplying omission or adding new ground of
relief. Teisinger v. Hardy, 91 Mont. 9, 5 P.2d 219,
On trial or argument. When a case is tried or
argued in court, the speech or argument of the
plaintiff in answer to that of the defendant. Un-
der the practice of the chancery and common-law
courts, to reply is to file or deliver a replication,

Pr. 351.

## REPORT

An official or formal statement of
facts or proceedings.
The formal statement in writing made to a
court by a master in chancery, a clerk, or referee,
as the result of his inquiries into some matter
referred to him by the court.
A "report" of a public official is distinguished from a
"return" of such official, in that "return" is typically con-
cerned with something done or observed by officer, while
"report" embodies result of officer's investigation not orig-
inally occurring within his personal knowledge. E. K.
Hardison Seed Co. V. Jones, C.C.A.6, 149 F.2d 252, 257.
The name is also applied (usually in the plural)
to the published volumes, appearing periodically,
containing accounts of the various cases argued
and determined in the courts with the decisions
thereon.
Lord Coke defines "report" to be "a public relation, or
a bringing again to memory cases judicially argued, de-

justice, together with such causes and reasons as were
delivered by the judges of the same." Co.Litt. 293.

## REPRESENTATION, ESTOPPEL BY

It arises
when one by acts, representations, admissions, or
silence when he ought to speak out, intentionally
or through culpable negligence induces another
to believe certain facts to exist and such other
rightfully relies and acts on such belief, so that
he will be prejudiced if the former is permitted
Curlew Creamery Co., 16 Wash.2d 476, 134 P.2d
66, '73. It differs from estoppel by record, deed,
or contract, in that it is not based on agreement of
parties or finding of fact which may not be dis-
puted, and is not mutual, but applies to only one
party. Bank of Canton & Trust Co. v. Clark, 198
N.C. 169, 151 S.E. 102, 104.
It is the effect of voluntary conduct of a party
whereby he is absolutely precluded, from assert-
ing rights which might perhaps have otherwise ex-
isted. Strand v. State, 16 Wash.2d 107, 132 P.2d
1011, 1015.
It is species of "equitable estoppel" or estoppel

claiming estoppel, Rhoads v. Rhoads, 342 Mo. 934, 119 S. W.
2d 247, 252; intent that other party should act on repre-
sentation or gross and culpable negligence of party sought
to be estopped, Cain v. Rea, 159 Va. 446, 166 S.E. 478, 483,
85 A.L.R. 945; Cleaveland v. Malden Say. Bank, 291 Mass.
295, 197 N.E. 14, 15; knowledge, actual or constructive, of
facts by person estopped, Rhoads v. Rhoads, 342 Mo. 934,
119 S.W.2d 247, 252; misleading of person claiming es-
toppel, Campbell v. Salyer, 290 Ky. 493, 161 S.W.2d 596,
599; Bosen v. Larrabee, 91 N.H. 492, 23 A.2d 331, 332;
reliance of one party on conduct of other party, Ouellette
v. City of New York Ins. Co., 133 Me. 149, 174 A. 462, 464;
Mosley v. Magnolia Petroleum Co., 45 N.M. 230, 114 P.2d

Price Control Act, means the legal successor or representa-
tive, such as a receiver, liquidator, executor, administra-
tor, guardian or tutor, but not an agent. Emergency Price
Control Act of 1942, § 302(h), 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, § 942

ed; but it may have a wider meaning, according
to the intention of the person using it, and may
include heirs, next of kin, descendants, assignees,

Also the withdrawing of any sentence for a pe-
riod of time. Ex parte Dormitzer, 119 Or. 336, 249
P. 639, 640.
It does no more than stay the execution of a sentence for
a time, and it is ordinarily an act of clemency extended to
a prisoner to afford him an opportunity to procure some
amelioration of the sentence imposed. Palka v. Walker,
124 Conn. 121, 198 A. 265, 267. It cannot be granted until
after sentence. State ex rel. Gordon v. Zangerle, 136 Ohio
St. 371, 26 N.E.2d 190, 194.

## REPRIMAND

A public and formal censure or
severe reproof, administered to a person in fault
by his superior officer or by a body to which he
belongs. Thus, a member of a legislative body
may be reprimanded by the presiding officer, in

some cases, is punished by a reprimand adminis-
tered by his commanding officer, or by the secre-
tary of war.

lands, as rent-charge, rent seck, pensions, cor-
rodies, annuities, etc., so that, when the clear year-
ly value of a manor is spoken of, it is said to be
so much per annum ultra reprisas,—besides all
reprises. Cowell. Delaware & H. Canal CO. v.
Von Storch, 196 Pa. 102, 46 A. 375.

13, 59 N.E. 452.
Repudiation of contract is in nature of anticipatory
breach before performance is due, but does not operate as
anticipatory breach unless promisee elects to treat repudia-
tion as breach, and brings suit for damages. Such repudia-
tion is but act or declaration in advance of any actual
breach and consists usually of absolute and unequivocal
declaration or act amounting to declaration on part of
promisor to promisee that he will not make performance
on future day at which contract calls for performance.

## REPUTATIO EST VULGARIS OPINIO UBI NON EST VERITAS

ET VULGARIS OPINIO EST
DUPLEX, SCIL.: OPINIO VULGARIS ORTA
INTER GRAVES ET DISCRETOS HOMINES, ET
QUIE VULTUM VERITATIS HABET; ET OPIN-
I0 TANTUM ORTA INTER LEVES ET VUL-
GARES HOMINES, ABSQUE SPECIE VERITA-
TIS. Reputation is common opinion where there
is not truth. And common opinion is of two kinds,
to-wit: Common reputation arising among grave
and sensible men, and which has the appearance
of truth; and mere opinion arising among foolish
and ignorant men, without any appearance of
truth. 4 Coke, 107.

## REPUTATION

Estimation in which one is held,
the character imputed to a person in the neigh-
borhood where he lives. State v. Baldanzo, 106
N.J.L. 498, 148 A. 725, 726, 67 A.L.R. 1207. Gener-
al opinion, good or bad, held of a person by those
of the community in which he yesides. State v.

2d 167, 170.
"Character" is made up of the things an individual actu-
ally is and does whereas ."reputation" is what people think
an individual is and what they say about him. McNaulty
v. State, 138 Tex.Cr.R. 317, 135 S.W.2d 987, 989; James v.
State, ex rel. Loser, 24 Tenn. App. 453, 145 S.W.2d 1026,
In the law of evidence, matters 6f public and
general interest, such as the boundaries of coun-
ties or towns, rights of common, claims of high-
way, etc., are allowed to be proved by general
reputation; e. g., by the declaration of deceased
persons made ante litem motam, by old docu-
ments, etc., notwithstanding the general rule
against secondary evidence. Best, Ev. 632.

## REPUTED

Accepted by general, vulgar, or pub-
lic opinion. Thus, land may be reputed part of a
manor, though not really so, and a certain district
may be reputed a parish or a manor, or be a par-
ish or a manor in reputation, although it is in real-
ity no parish or manor at all. Brown; Lowell
Hardware Co. v. May, 59 Colo. 475, 149 P. 831, 833.

ley-Tobin Co. v. White, 84 N.J.Eq. 60, 188, 94
A. 52, 53. For "Express Request," see that title.
The two words, "request" and "require," as used in no-
tices to creditors to present claims against an estate, are
of the same origin, and virtually synonymous. Prentice v.
Whitney, 8 Hun, N.Y., 300.
Pleading
The statement in the plaintiff's declaration that
.

## RES

Lat. In the civil law. A thing; an object.
As a term of the law, this word has a very wide
and extensive signification, including not only
things which are objects of property, but also
such as are not capable of individual ownership.
Inst. 2, 1, pr. And in old English law it is said
to have a general import, comprehending both
corporeal and incorporeal things of whatever kind,
nature, or species. 3 Inst. 182- Bract. fol. 7b.
By "res," according to the modern civilians, is
meant everything that may form an object of
rights, in opposition to "persona," which is re-
garded as a subject of rights. "Res," therefore, in
its general meaning, comprises actions of all
kinds; while in its restricted sense it compre-
hends every object of right, except actions. Mack-
eld. Rom. Law, § 146. This has reference to the
fundamental division of the Institutes, that all
law relates either to persons, to things, or to ac-
tions. Inst. 1, 2, 12.
In modern usage, the term is particularly ap-
plied to an object, subject-matter, or status, con-
sidered as the defendant in an action, or as the
object against which, directly, proceedings are
taken. Thus, in a prize case, the captured ves-
sel is "the res." And proceedings of this charac-
ter are said to be in rem. (See In Personam;
In Rem.) "Res" may also denote the action or
proceeding, as when a cause, which is not be-
tween adversary parties, is entitled "In re
Classification
Things (res) have been variously divided and
classified in law, e. g., in the following ways: (1)
Corporeal and incorporeal things; (2) movables
and immovables; (3) res mancipi and res nec
mancipi; (4) things real and things personal;
(5) things in possession and choses (i. e., things)
in action; (6) fungible things and things not
fungible, (fungibiles vel non fungibiles;) and
(7) res singulce (i. e., individual objects) and uni-
versitates rerum, (i. e., aggregates of things.)
Also persons are for some purposes and in certain
respects regarded as things. Brown.
General
Res accessoria. In the civil law. An accessory
thing; that which belongs to a principal thing,
or is in connection with it.
Res adiratee. The gist of the old action for res
adiratce was the fact that the plaintiff had lost
his goods, that they had come into the hands of
the defendant, and that the defendant, on request,
refused to give them up. 3 Holdsw.Hist.E.L. 275.
Res adjudicata. A common but indefensible
misspelling of res judicata. The latter term des-
ignates a point or question or subject-matter
which was in controversy or dispute and has been
authoritatively and finally settled by the decision
of a court; that issuable fact once legally deter-
tion or subsequent proceeding. Tiffany Produc-
tion of California v. Superior Court of California
for Los Angeles County, 131 Cal.App. 729, 22 P.
2d 275.
Res adjudicata (if there be such a term) could
only mean an article or subject of property
"awarded to" a. given person by the judgment of
a court, which might perhaps be the case in re-
plevin and similar actions.
Res caduca. In the civil law. A fallen or es-
cheated thing; an escheat. Hallifax, Civil Law,
b. 2, c. 9, no. 60.
Res communes. In the civil law. Things com-
mon to all; that is, those things which are used
and enjoyed by every one, even in single parts,
but can never be exclusively acquired as a whole,
e. g., light and air. Inst. 2, 1, 1; Mackeld. Rom.
Law, § 169.
Res controversa. In the civil law. A matter
controverted; a matter in controversy; a point in
question; a question for determination. Calvin.
Res coronae. In old English law. Things of the
crown; such as ancient manors, homages of the
king, liberties, etc. Fleta, lib. 3, c. 6, § 3.
Res corporales. In the civil law. Corporeal
things; things which can be touched, or are per-
ceptible to the senses. Dig. 1, 8, 1, 1; inst. 2, 2;
Bract. fols. 7b, 10b, 13b.
Res derelicta. Abandoned property; property
thrown away or forsaken by the owner, so as to
become open to the acquisition of the first taker
or occupant. Rhodes v. Whitehead, 27 Tex. 313,
84 Am.Dec. 631.
Res fungibiles. In the civil law. Fungible
things, things of such a nature that they can be
replaced by equal quantities and qualities when
returning a loan or delivering goods purchased,
for example, so many bushels of wheat or so many
dollars; but a particular horse or a particular
jewel would not be of this character.
Res furtivie. In Scotch law. Goods which have
been stolen. Bell.
Res gestoe. Things done. McClory v. Schnei-
der, Tex.Civ.App., 51 S.W.2d 738, 741. Those cir-
cumstances which are the automatic and unde-
signed incidents of a particular litigated act, which
may be separated from act by lapse of time more
or less appreciable, and which are admissible
when illustrative of such act. The whole of the
transaction under investigation and every part
of it. Res gestEe is considered as an exception to
the hearsay rule. In its operation it renders acts
and declarations which constitute a part of the
things done and said admissible in evidence, even
though they would otherwise come within the rule
excluding hearsay evidence or self-serving declara-
tions. The rule is extended to include, not only
declarations by the parties to the suit, but includes
statements made by bystanders and strangers, un-
der certain circumstances. Edwards v. West Tex-
as Hospital, Tex.Civ.App., 89 S.W.2d 801, 809;
Slayback Van Order Co. v. Eiben, 177 A. 671, 673,
115 N.J.L. 17. For evidence to be admissible as res
gestfe, there must be an act in itself admissible in
the case independently of the declaration that ac-
companies it; a declaration uttered simultaneous-
ly, or almost simultaneously, with the occurrence
of the act; and the explanation of the act by what
is said when it happens. Staley v. Royal Pines
Park, 202 N.C. 155, 162 S.E. 202, 203.
Test as to whether declaration is part of res Best a de-
pends on whether declaration was facts talking through
party or party talking about facts. Batchelor v. Atlantic
Coast Line R. Co., 196 N.C. 84, 144 S.E. 542, 544, 60 A.L.R.
"Res gestae", while often spoken of as an exception to
the hearsay rule, is generally not such in fact but ordi-
narily it relates to statements which because of their in-
timate relation to facts become a part of those facts and
are therefore admitted as such. Industrial Commission of
Colorado v. Fotis, 112 Colo. 423, 149 P.2d 657, 659.
Res habiles. In the civil law, things which are
prescriptible; things to which a lawful title may
be acquired by ordinary prescription.
Res immobiles. In the civil law. Immovable
things; including land and that which is connect-
ed therewith, either by nature or art, such as trees
and buildings. Mackeld. Rom. Law, § 160.
Res incorporales. In the civil law. Incorporeal
things; things which cannot be touched; such as
those things which consist in right. Inst. 2, 2;
Bract. fols. 7b, 10b. Such things as the mind alone
,can perceive.
Res integra. A whole thing; a new or un-
opened thing. The term is applied to those points
of law which have not been decided, which are
untouched by dictum or decision. 3 Mer. 269.
Res inter alios acta. A thing done between
others, or between third parties or strangers.
Chicago, etc., R. Co. v. Schmitz, 211 Ill. 446, 71
N.E. 1050.
Res ipsa loquitur. The thing speaks for itself.
Rebuttable presumption that defendant was neg-
ligent, which arises upon proof that instrumental-
ity causing injury was in defendant's exclusive
control, and that the accident was one which
ordinarily does not happen in absence of negli-
gence. Sliwowski v. New York, N. H. & H. R. Co.,
'94 Conn. 303, 108 A. 805, 807; Poth v. Dexter
Horton Estate, 140 Wash. 272, 248 P. 374, 375;
Pearson v. Butts, 224 Iowa 376, 276 N.W. 65, 67.
Res judicata. A matter adjudged; a thing judi-
cially acted upon or decided; a thing or matter
settled by judgment. A phrase of the civil law,
constantly quoted in the books. Epstein v. Soskin,
86 Misc.Rep. 94, 148 N.Y.S. 323, 324; Rule that
final judgment or decree on merits by court of
competent jurisdiction is conclusive of rights of
parties or their privies in all later suits on points
and matters determined in former suit. American
S. S. Co. v. Wickwire Spencer Steel Co., D.C.N.Y.,
8 F.Supp. 562, 566. And to be applicable, requires
identity in thing sued for as well as identity of
cause of action, of persons and parties to action,
and of quality in persons for or against whom
claim is made. Freudenreich v. Mayor and Coun-
cil of Borough of Fairview, 114 N.J.L. 290, 176
A. 162, 163. The sum and substance of the whole
rule is that a matter once judicially decided is
finally decided. Massie v. Paul, 263 Ky. 183, 92 S.

tion not before decided.

trial Corporation v. Lilienfeld's Estate, C.C.A.Va.,

## RESCISSIO

Lat. In the civil law. An annul-
ling; avoiding, or making void; abrogation; re-
scission. Cod. 4, 44.
In Spanish law, nullity is divided into absolute and rela-
tive. The former is that which arises from a law, whether
civil or criminal, the principal motive for which is the
public interest; and the latter is that which affects only
certain individuals. "Nullity" is not to be confounded
with "rescission." Nullity takes place when the act is af-
fected by a radical vice, which prevents it from producing
any effect; as where an act is in con traventioR of the laws
or of good morals, or where it has been executed by a per-
son who cannot be supposed to have any will, as a child
under the age of seven years, or a madman, (un nino
demente. ) Rescission is where an act, valid in appearance,
nevertheless conceals a defect, which may make it null, if
demanded by any of the parties; as, for example, mistake,
relates generally to public order, and cannot therefore be
made good either by ratification or prescription; so that
the tribunals ought, for this reason alone, to decide that
the null act can have no effect, without stopping to inquire
whether the parties to it have or have not received any
injury. Rescission, on the contrary, may be made good by
ratification or by the silence of the parties ; and neither of
the parties can demand it, unless he can prove that he has
received some prejudice or sustained some damage by the
act. Sunol v. Hepburn, 1 Cal. 281, citing Escriche.

## RESCISSION OF CONTRACT

Annulling or ab-
rogation or unmaking of contract and the placing
of the parties to it in status quo. Sessions v.
Meadows, 13 Cal.App.2d 748, 57 P.2d 548, 549.
Runde v. O'Brian, 214 Iowa 921, 243 N.W. 594, 595.
It necessarily involves a repudiation of the con-
tract and a refusal of the moving party to be fur-
ther bound by it. Wall v. Zynda, 283 Mich. 260,
278 N.W. 66, 68, 114 A.L.R. 1521.

rescind or annul a deed or contract.

## RESCOUS

goods which had been taken under a distress, or
the violently taking away a man who is under
arrest, and setting him at liberty, or otherwise
procuring his escape, are both so denominated.
This was also the name of a writ which lay in

for future litigated or doubtful legal questions.
Mackeld. Rom. Law, § 46.

cape capture.

## RESCUE DOCTRINE

Under this doctrine, one
injured in voluntary attempt to rescue a person
whose life is imperiled by negligence of another
may recover from the negligent person if the at-
tempted rescue be not an act of extreme reckless-
ness. Rovinski v. Rowe, C.C.A.Mich., 131 F.2d

quires only bodily presence as an inhabitant of a
place. In re Campbell's Guardianship, 216 Minn.
113, 11 N.W.2d 786, 789.
As "domicile" and "residence" are usually in the same
place, they are frequently used as if they had the same
meaning, but they are not identical terms, for a person
may have two places of residence, as in the city and coun-
try, but only one domicile. Residence means living in a
particular locality, but domicile means living in that lo-
cality with intent to make it a fixed and permanent home.
Residence simply requires bodily presence as an inhabitant
in a given place, while domicile requires bodily presence
in that place and also an intention to make it one's domi-
cile. In re Riley's Will, 266 N.Y.S. 209, 148 Misc. 588.
"Residence" demands less intimate local ties than "domi-
cile," but "domicile" allows absence for indefinite period
if intent to return remains. Immigration Act 1917, § 3, 8
U.S.C.A. § 136 (e, p). Transatlantica Italiana v. Elting,
C.C.A.N.Y., 74 F.2d, 732, 733. But see, Ward v. Ward, 115

Lines v. Craig, 182 Okl. 610, 80 P.2d 221, 224; holding that
residence and domicile are synonymous terms. "Resi-
dence" has a meaning dependent on context and purpose
of statute. In re Jones, 341 Pa. 329, 19 A.2d 280, 282.
Words "residence" and "domicile"- may have an identical
or variable meaning depending on subject-matter and con-
text of statute. Kemp v. Kemp, 16 N.Y.S.2d 26, 34, 172
Misc. 738.

Civil Law
The cancellation or annulling, by the act of par-

tract which was valid and binding, in consequence
of some cause or matter arising after the making

contract from the beginning, would be ground for
rescission. 7 Toullier, no. 551.
Legislative Practice
The term is usually employed to denote the
adoption of a motion, the subject-matter of which
would not properly constitute a statute; such as
a mere expression of opinion; an alteration of
the rules; a vote of thanks or of censure, etc.
McDowell v. People, 68 N.E. 379, 204 Ill. 499; Con-
ley v. Texas Division of United Daughters of the
Confederacy, Tex.Civ.App., 164 S.W. 24, 26.
The chief distinction between a "resolution"
and a "law" is that the former is used whenever
the legislative body passing it wishes merely to
express an opinion as to some given matter or
thing and is only to have a temporary effect on
such particular thing, while by a "law" it is in-
tended to permanently direct and control matters
applying to persons or things in general. Ex
parte Hague, 104 N.J.Eq. 31, 144 A. 546, 559.
Joint resolution. A resolution adopted by both
houses of congress or a legislature. When such
a resolution has been approved by the president

The distinction between a joint resolution and a
concurrent resolution of congress, is that the for-
mer requires the approval of the president while
the latter does not. Rep. Sen. Jud. Corn. Jan.
If a resolution originating in one house of the Legisla-
ture is passed by that house and is then sent to the other
for its concurrence, and is passed by it, signed by the
presiding officer of each house and approved by the Gover-
nor, it is a "joint resolution" as that term is used in the
Constitution and the joint rules of the Legislature. Okla-
homa News Co. v. Ryan, 101 Okl. 151, 224 P. 969, 971.
Practice

This word is frequently used in this sense by Coke and
some of the more ancient reporters.

ment, the pleading is resumed, and the action pro-
ceeds. Steph.Pl. 115; 3 Bl.Comm. 303; Bauer v.
Roth, 4 Rawle (Pa.) 91.
RESPONDEAT RAPTOR, QUI IGNORARE NON
POTUIT QUOD PUPILLUM ALIENUM ABDUX-
IT. Hob. 99. Let the ravisher answer, for he

Gaulding, 24 Ga.App. 478, 101 S.E. 311; Delaware,
L. & W. R. Co. v. Pittinger, C.C.A.N.J., 293 F. 853,

to whom master owes duty to use care, provided
failure of servant to use such care occurred in
course of his employment. Shell Petroleum Cor-
poration v. Magnolia Pipe Line Co., Tex.Civ.App.,

whether the vessel or her cargo or both be the
security. Maude & P. Shipp. 433; Smith, Merc.

of law referred to them, by certain learned Roman

## REVERSIO

L. Lat. In old English law. The

10, 12.
REVERSIO TER/LE EST TANQUAM TERRA
REVERTENS IN POSSESSIONE DONATOR!,
SIVE HJEREDIBUS SUIS POST DONUM FINI-
TIM. Co. Litt. 142. A reversion of land is, as
it were, the return of the land to the possession
of the donor or his heirs after the termination of
the estate granted.
REVERSION, or ESTATE IN REVERSION. The
residue of an estate left by operation of law in
the grantor or his heirs, or in the heirs of a tes-
tator, commencing in possession on the determina-
tion of a particular estate granted or devised.
Strong v. Shatto, 45 Cal.App. 29, 187 P. 159, 162;
Vantage Mining Co. v. Baker, 170 Mo.App. 457,
155 S.W. 466, 467.
Any future interest left in a transferor or his
successor. Miller v. Dierken, 153 Pa.Super. 389,
33 A.2d 804, 805. It is a vested interest or estate,
in as much as person entitled to it has a fixed
right to future enjoyment. State ex rel. Tozer v.
Probate Court of Washington County, 102 Minn.
268, 113 N.W. 888, 893.
The term reversion has two meanings, first, as desig-
nating the estate left in the grantor during the continu-
ance of a particular estate and also the residue left in
grantor or his heirs after termination of particular es-
tate. Davidson v. Davidson, 350 Mo. 639, 167 S.W.2d 641,
642. Miller v. C. I. R., C.C.A.6, 147 F.2d 189, 193.
It differs from a remainder in that it arises by act of
the law, whereas a remainder is by act of the parties. A
reversion, moreover, is the remnant left in the grantor,
whilst a remainder is the remnant of the whole estate dis-
posed of, after a preceding part of the same has been
given away. Copenhaver v. Pendleton, 155 Va. 463, 155 S.
E. 802, 806, 77 A.L.R. 324.
Scotch Law

has been either mortgaged or adjudicated to se-
cure the payment of a debt. In the former case,

832, 835.
In a loose way the term "revert to" is sometimes used in
a will as the equivalent of "go to," and, where the lan-
guage of a will so indicates, it will be construed as used to
designate the person to whom the testator wished the land
to be given. Mastellar v. Atkinson, 94 Kan. 279, 146 P.
367, 368, Ann.Cas.1917B, 502; In re Owens' Will, 164 Wis.

## RIGHT

As a noun, and taken in an abstract
sense, justice, ethical correctness, or consonance
with the rules of law or the principles of morals.
In this signification it answers to one meaning
of the Latin "jus," and serves to indicate law in
the abstract, considered as the foundation of all
rights, or the complex of underlying moral prin-
ciples which impart the character of justice to
all positive law, or give it an ethical content.
As a noun, and taken in a concrete sense, a
power, privilege, faculty, or demand, inherent in
one person and incident upon another. "Rights"
are defined generally as "powers of free action."
And the primal rights pertaining to men are un-
doubtedly enjoyed by human beings purely as
such, being grounded in personality, and existing
antecedently to their recognition by positive law.
But leaving the abstract moral sphere, and giving
to the term a juristic content, a "right" is well de-
fined as "a capacity residing in one man of con-
trolling, with the assent and assistance of the
state, the actions of others." Holl. Jur. 69.
The noun substantive "a right" signifies that which ju-
rists denominate a "faculty ;" that which resides in a de-
terminate person, by virtue of a given law, and which
avails against a person (or answers to a duty lying on a
person) other than the person in whom it resides. And
the noun substantive "rights" is the plural of the noun.
substantive "a right." But the expression "right," when
it is used as an adjective, is equivalent to the adjective
"justly." And, when used as the abstract name corres-
ponding to the adjective "right," the noun substantive
"right" is synonymoms with the noun substantive "jus-
tice." Aust.Jur. § 264, not.
In a narrower signification, an interest or title
in an object of property; a just and legal claim
to hold, use, or enjoy it, or to convey or donate it,
as he may please. See Co. Litt. 345a.
The term "right," in civil society, is defined to mean
that which a man is entitled to have, or to do, or to re-
ceive from others within the limits prescribed by law.
Atehison & N. R. Co. v. Baty, 6 Neb. 40, 29 Am.Rep. 356.
That which one person ought to have or receive
from another, it being withheld from him, or not
in his possession. In this sense "right" has the
force of "claim," and is properly expressed by the
Latin "jus." Lord Coke considers this to be the
proper signification of the word, especially in
writs and pleadings, where an estate is turned to
a right; as by discontinuance, disseisin, etc. Co.
Litt. 345a.
See, also, Droit; Jus; Recht.
Classification
Rights may be described as perfect or imper-
fect, according as their action or scope is clear,
settled, and determinate, or is vague and unfixed.
Rights are either in personam or in rem. A.
right in personam is one which imposes an obli-
gation on a definite person. A right in rem is one
which imposes an obligation on persons gener-
ally; 1. e., either on all the world or on all the
world except certain determinate persons. Thus,
if I am entitled to exclude all persons from a giv-
en piece of land, I have a right in rem in respect
of that land; and, if there are one or more per-
sons, A., B., and C., whom I am not entitled to
exclude from it, my right is still a right in rem.
Sweet.
Rights may also be described as either primary
.or secondary. Primary rights are those which can
be created without reference to rights already
existing. Secondary rights can only arise for the
purpose of protecting or enforcing primary rights.
They are either preventive (protective) or rem-
edial (reparative.) Sweet.
Preventive or protective secondary rights exist
in order to prevent the infringement or loss of
primary rights. They are judicial when they re-
quire the assistance -of a court of law for their en-
forcement, and extrajudicial when they are capa-
ble of being exercised by the party himself. Rem-
edial or reparative secondary rights are also ei-
their judicial or extrajudicial. They may further
be divided into (1) rights of restitution or restora-
tion, which entitle the person injured to be re-
placed in his original position; (2) rights of en-
forcement, which entitle the person injured to
the performance of an act by the person bound;
and (3) rights of satisfaction or compensation.
Sweet.
With respect to the ownership of external ob-
jects of property, rights may be classed as ab-
solute and qualified. An absolute right gives to
-the person in whom it inheres the uncontrolled
dominion over the object at all times and for all
a right to the object for certain purposes or un-
der certain circumstances only. Such is the right
of a bailee to recover the article bailed when it
has been unlawfully taken from him by a stran-
ger.
Rights are also either legal or equitable. The
former is the case where the person seeking to
enforce the right for his own benefit has the legal
title and a remedy at law. The latter are such as
are enforceable only in equity; as, at the suit of
cestui que trust.
Constitutional Law
There is also a classification of rights, with re-
spect to the constitution of civil society. Thus,
according to Blackstone, "the rights of persons,
considered in their natural capacities, are of two
sorts,—absolute and relative; absolute, which
are such as appertain and belong to particular
men, merely as individuals or single persons; rel-
ative, which are incident to them as members of
society, and standing in various relations to each
other." 1 Bl. Comm. 123. Johnson v. Johnson, 32
Ala. 637; People v. Berberrich, 20 Barb, (N. Y.)
Rights are also classified in constitutional law
as natural, civil, and political, to which there is
sometimes added the class of "personal rights."
Natural rights are those which grow out of the
nature of man and depend upon personality, as
distinguished from such as are created by law and
depend upon civilized society; or they are those
which are plainly assured by natural law (Borden
v. State, 11 Ark. 519, 44 Am.Dec. 217) ; or those
which, by fair deduction from the present physi-
cal, moral, social, and religious characteristics
of man, he must be invested with, and which he
ought to have realized for him in a jural society,
in order to fulfill the ends to which his nature
calls him. 1 Woolsey, Polit. Science, p. 26. Such
are the rights of life, liberty, privacy, and good
reputation. See Black, Const. Law (3d Ed.) 523.
Civil rights are such as belong to every citizen
of the state or country, or, in a wider sense, to
all its inhabitants, and are not connected with the
organization or administration of government.
They include the rights of property, marriage,
protection by the laws, freedom of contract, trial
by jury, etc. Winnett v. Adams, 71 Neb. 817, 99
N.W. 681. Or, as otherwise defined, civil rights
are rights appertaining to a person in virtue of
his citizenship in a state or community. Rights
capable of being enforced or redressed in a civil
action. Also a term applied to certain rights se-
cured to citizens of the United States by the thir-
teenth and fourteenth amendments to the consti-
tution, and by various acts of congress made in
pursuance thereof. State of Iowa v. Railroad Co.,
C.C.Iowa, 37 F. 498, 3 L.R.A. 554; State v. Powers,
51 N.J.L. 432, 17 A. 969.
Political rights consist in the power to partici-
pate, directly or indirectly, in the establishment or
administration of government, such as the right
of citizenship, that of suffrage, the right to hold
Const. Law (3d Ed.) 524; Winnett v. Adams, 71
Neb. 817, 99 N.W. 681.
Personal rights is a term of rather vague im-
port, but generally it may be said to mean the
right of personal security, comprising those of
life, limb, body, health, reputation, and the right
of personal liberty.
As an Adjective
The term "right" means just, morally correct,
consonant with ethical principles or rules of posi-
tive law. It is the opposite of wrong, unjust, il-
legal.
Old English Law
The term denoted an accusation or charge of
crime. Fitzh. Nat. Brev. 66 F.

right of a person to injunctive relief, is used as a mere
distinguishing term from "public right," and not as mean-
ing any particular monopolistic right. Long v. Southern
Express Co., D.C.Fla., 201 F. 441, 444. "Private rights" of
a municipal corporation, as effecting the running of the
statute of limitations, are such as only that part of the
municipality included within the corporate limits of a
municipality are interested in. Board of Com'rs of Wood-
ward County v. Willett, 49 Okl. 254, 152 P. 365, 366, L.R.A.

## RIGHT AND WRONG TEST

Under "this test"
if, at the time of committing an act, the party was
laboring under such a defect of reason from dis-
ease of the mind as not to know the nature and
quality of the act he was doing, or if he did know
the nature and quality thereof, that he did not
know that he was doing what was wrong, he
should not be held responsible under the criminal
law. State v. Wallace, 170 Or. 60, 131 P.2d 222,
229, 230.

a given transaction or state of facts and based
thereon. Hibbard v. Clark, 56 N.H. 155, 22 Am.
Rep. 442; Webster v. County Com'rs, 63 Me. 29.
By the old writers the phrase is commonly used to de-
note that a person has lost a right of entry, and has noth-
ing but a right of action left. Co.Litt. 363b.

## RIGHT OF DISCUSSION

Bell, Comm. 347.

## RIGHT OF ENTRY

The right of taking or re-
suming possession of land by entering on it in a

one man, while another has the actual possession,
being the right to enter and turn out such actual
occupant; e. g., the right of a disseisee. An ap-
parent right of possession is one which may be
defeated by a better; an actual right of posses-
sion, one which will stand the test against all
opponents. 2 Bl. Comm. 196; Cahill v. Pine Creek
Oil Co., 38 Okl. 568, 134 P. 64, 65.

## RIGHT OF PRIVACY

See Privacy.

## RIGHT OF PROPERTY

The mere right of prop-
erty in land; the abstract right which remains to
the owner after he has lost the right of posses-
sion, and to recover which the writ of right was

to lands, tenements, and hereditaments. 2 Bl.
Comm. 197.

## RIGHT OF REDEMPTION

The right to disen-
cumber property or to free it from a claim or
lien; specifically, the right (granted by statute
only) to free property from the incumbrance of a
foreclosure or other judicial sale, or to recover the
title passing thereby, by paying what is due, with
interest, costs, etc. Not to be confounded with
the "equity of redemption," which exists independ-
ently of statute but must be exercised before sale.
Mayer v. Farmers' Bank, 44 Iowa 216; Millett v.
Mullen, 95 Me. 400, 49 A. 871. Western Land &

tered. Sweet.

## RIGHT OF SEARCH

to ascertain whether the latter is carrying contra-
band goods.

## RIGHT OF WAY

The right of passage or of
way is a servitude imposed by law or by conven-
tion, and by virtue of which one has a right to
pass on foot, or horseback, or in a vehicle, to
drive beasts of burden or carts, through the es-
tate of another. When this servitude results from
the law, the exercise of it is confined to the wants
of the person who has it. When it is the result
is regulated by the contract. Civ.Code La. art.
"Right of way," in its strict meaning, is the right of
passage over another man's ground; and in its legal and
generally accepted meaning, in reference to a railway, it is
a mere easement in the lands of others, obtained by lawful
condemnation to public use or by purchase. It would be
using the term in an unusual sense, by applying it to an ab-
solute purchase of the fee-simple of lands to be used for
a railway or any other kind of a way. Williams v. West-
ern Union Ry. Co., 50 Wis. 76, 5 N.W. 482. And see Kripp
v. Curtis, 71 Cal. 62, 11 P. 879; Stuyvesant v. Woodruff.
21 N.J.L. 136, 57 Am. Dec. 156.
"Right of way" has a twofold significance, being some-
times used to mean the mere intangible right to cross, a
right of crossing, a right of way, and often used to other-
wise indicate that strip of land which a railroad appropri-
ates to its own use, and upon which it builds its roadbed.
Marion, B. & E. Traction Co. v. Simmons, 180 Ind. 289, 102
N.E. 132.
The "right of way" is a space of conventional width
for one or more railroad tracks, while a "railroad yard"
might be extended indefinitely. City of New York v. New
York & H. R. Co., Sup., 169 N.Y.S. 12, 14.

## RIGHT PATENT

An obsolete writ, which was
brought for lands and tenements, and not for an
advowson, or common, and lay only for an estate
in fee-simple, and not for him who had a, lesser
estate; as tenant in tail, tenant in frank mar-
riage, or tenant for life. Fitzh. Nat. Brev. 1.

## RIGHT TO BEGIN

On the hearing or trial of a
cause, or the argument of a demurrer, petition,
etc., the right to begin is the right of first address-
ing the court or jury. The right to begin is fre-
quently of importance, as the counsel who begins
has also the right of replying or having the last
word after the counsel on the opposite side has
addressed the court or jury. Sweet.

## RIGHT TO REDEEM

Right of redemption,
which title see.

## RIGHTS OF PERSONS

Rights which concern
and are annexed to the persons of men. 1 Bl.

## RING

A clique; an exclusive combination of
persons for illegitimate or selfish purposes; as to
control elections or political affairs, distribute of-
fices, obtain contracts, control the market or the
stock-exchange, etc. Schomberg v. Walker, 132
Cal. 224, 64 P. 290.
applied in England to a trick frequently prac-
tised in committing larcenies.
It is difficult to define it; it will be sufficiently exem-
plified by the following cases. The prisoner, with some ac-
complices, being in company with the prosecutor, pretend-
ed to find a valuable ring wrapped up in a paper, appear-
ing to be a jeweller's receipt for "a rich brilliant diamond
ring." They offered to leave the ring with the prosecutor
if he would deposit some money and his watch as a securi-
ty. The prosecutor, having accordingly laid down his
watch and money on a table, was beckoned out of the
room by one of the confederates, while the others took
away his watch and money. This was held to amount
to a larceny; 1 Leach 273. In another case, under similar
circumstances, the prisoner procured from the prosecutor
twenty guineas, promising to return them the next morn-
ing, and leaving the false jewel with him. This ,was also
held to be larceny; 1 Leach 314; 2 East, Pl.Cr. 679.

## RINGING THE CHANGES

A larceny effected
by tendering a large bill or coin in payment of a
small purchase and after correct change has been
given, asking for other change and repeating the
request until in the confusion of mind created by
so many operations, more money is obtained than
the thief is entitled to. Howell v. State, 28 Ala.
App. 249, 182 So. 96, 97.

## RINGING UP

A custom among commission mer-
chants and brokers (not unlike the clearing-house
system) by which they exchange contracts for
sale against contracts for purchase, or reciprocally
cancel such contracts, adjust differences of price
between themselves, and surrender margins. Sam-
uels v. Oliver, 130 Ill. 73, 22 N.E. 499; U. S. v.
New York Coffee & Sugar Exchange, 44 S.Ct. 225,
226, 263 U.S. 611, 68 L.Ed. 475.
RINGS—GIVING. In English practice. A custom
observed by serjeants at law, on being called to
that degree or order. The rings are given to the
judges, and bear certain mottoes, selected by the
serjeant about to take the degree. Brown.

## RIOT

In criminal law. A tumultuous disturb-
ance of the peace by three persons or more, as-
sembling together of their own authority, with an
intent mutually to assist each other against any
who shall oppose them, in the execution of some
enterprise of a private nature, and afterwards ac-
tually executing the same in a violent and turbu-
lent manner, to the terror of the people, whether
the act intended were of itself lawful or unlaw-
ful. Hawk. P. C. c. 65, § 1. State v. Stalcup, 23
N.C. 30, 35 Am.Dec. 732. Symonds v. State, 66
Okl.Cr. 49, 89 P.2d 970, 973.
When three or more persons together, and in a violent
or tumultuous manner, assemble together to do an unlaw-
ful act, or together do a lawful act in an unlawful, violent,
or tumultuous manner, to the disturbance of others, they
are guilty of a riot. Any use of force or violence, disturb-
ing the public peace, or any threat to use such force or
violence, if accompanied by immediate power of execution,
by two or more persons acting together, and without au-
thority of law, is a riot.

## RIOT ACT

A celebrated English statute, which
provides that, if any twelve persons or more are
unlawfully assembled and disturbing the peace,
any sheriff, under-sheriff, justice of the peace, or
mayor may, by proclamation, command them to
disperse, (which is familiarly called "reading the
main together for the space of one hour after such
proclamation, they are all guilty of felony. The
act is 1 Geo. I, St. 2, c. 5.

Coke takes to mean water running between two
banks; in other places it is rendered "bank."
RIPARIAN. Belonging or relating to the bank
of a river; of or on the bank. Land lying beyond
the natural watershed of a stream is not "ripar-
ian." Bathgate v. Irvine, 126 Cal. 135, 58 P. 442,
77 Am.St.Rep. 158. Town of Gordonsville v. Zinn,
129 Va. 542, 106 S.E. 508, 513, 14 A.L.R. 318.
The term is sometimes used as relating to the shore of
the sea or other tidal water, or of a lake or other consid-
erable body of water not having the character of a water-
course. But this , is not accurate. The proper word to be
employed in such connections is "littoral."

are navigable and others not. The common-law distinction
is that navigable rivers are those only wherein the tide ebbs
and flows. But, in modern usage, any river is navigable
which affords passage to ships and vessels, irrespective of
its being affected by the tide.
Public river. A river capable in its natural
state of some useful service to the public because
of its existence as such, navigability being not the
sole test. St. Regis Paper Co. v. New Hampshire

such circumstances that, in the absence of vio-
lence or threats, the act committed would be a
theft. Steph. Crim. Dig. 208; 2 Russ. Crimes, 78.
And see, further, State v. Osborne, 116 Iowa 479,
89 N.W. 1077. Thomas v. State, 91 Ala. 34, 9 So.
Generally speaking, the elements of "robbery" are the
taking of personal property or money from the person or
presence of another by actual or constructive force with-
out his consent and with the animus furandi or intent to
steal. Robbery may thus be said to be a compound lar-
ceny, composed of the crime of larceny from the person
with the aggravation of force, actual or constructive, used
in the taking. Williams v. Mayo, 126 Fla. 871, 172 So. 86,

325. It differs from robbery in general only in
the place where it is committed. Robbery by hold-
up originally applied to the stopping and robbery
of traveling parties, but the term has acquired a
broader meaning. It has come to be applied to
robbery in general, by the use of force or putting
in fear. Duluth St. Ry. Co. v. Fidelity & Deposit
Co. of Maryland, 136 Minn. 299, 161 N.W. 595,
596, L.R.A. 1917D, 684. In England, by St. 23 Hen.

## VIII

c. 1, this was made felony without benefit

ished by St. 3 & 4 W. & M. c. 9, and in this coun-
try it has never prevailed generally.

## ROBE

A schedule of parchment which may be

A schedule or sheet of parchment on which le-

In English practice, there were formerly a great
variety of these rolls, appropriated to the different
proceedings; such as the warrant of attorney
roll, the process roll, the recognizance roll, the
imparlance roll, the plea roll, the issue roll, the
judgment roll, the scire facias roll, and the roil
of proceedings on writs of error. 2 Tidd, Pr. 729,
In modern practice, the term is sometimes used
to denote a record of the proceedings of a court
or public office.
Thus, in English practice, the roll of parchment on
which the issue is entered is termed the "Issue roll." So
the rolls of a manor, wherein the names, rents, and serv-
ices of the tenants are copied and enrolled, are termed
the "court rolls." There are also various other rolls ; as
those which contain the records of the court of chancery,
those which contain the registers of the proceedings of old
parliaments, called "rolls of parliament," etc. Brown.

Chitty, Stat. 514; Freem. Judg. § 75. The Judi-
cature Act of 1875 requires every judgment to be
entered in a book by the proper officer.
It has been abolished, as such, in New Jersey; Jennings
v. Philadelphia & R. Co., C.C.N.J., 23 F. 569, 571. There
is said to be hopeless confusion in the cases in this coun-
try as to what constitutes the judgment roll. All the
cases agree that the complaint, the summons and, most of
them, the return on the summons, the affidavit for publi-
cation in case of constructive service, and papers of that
sort are included therein; Terry v. Gibson, 23 Colo.App.
273, 128 P. 1127, 1128, citing many cases, and also 1 Gr.

court was there held, the master of the rolls sit-
ting as judge; and that judge still sits there as
a judge of the chancery division of the high court
of justice. Wharton.

sonality of the Roman Catholic Church, with the

ish laws from the beginning of the settlements in
the Indies, also by our treaty with Spain in 1898,
whereby its property rights were solemnly safe-
guarded. Municipality of Ponce v. Roman Catho-
lic Church in Porto Rico, 28 S.Ct. 737, 210 U.S.

## ROMAN LAW

In a general sense, comprehends
all the laws which prevailed among the Romans,
without regard to the time of their origin, includ-
ing the collections of Justinian.
In a more restricted sense, the Germans under-
stand by this term merely the law of Justinian,
as adopted by them. Mackeld. Rom. Law, § 18.
In England and America, it appears to be cus-
tomary to use the phrase, indifferently with "the
civil law," to designate the whole system of Ro-
man jurisprudence, including the Corpus Juris
Civilis; or, if any distinction is drawn, the ex-
pression "civil law" denotes the system of juris-
prudence obtaining in those countries of con-
tinental Europe which have derived their juridi-
,
cal notions and principles from the Justinian col-
lection, while "Roman law" is reserved as the
proper appellation of the body of law developed
under the government of Rome from the earliest
times to the fall of the empire.

made, and is not actually made, are called "com-
actually made to the court in term, or upon a

tice, made for the purposes of a particular case.

no interest in property is good unless it must vest,

## RYOT-TENURE

A system of land-tenure, where
the government takes the place of landowners
and collects the rent by means of tax gatherers.
The farming is done by poor peasants, (ryots),
who find the capital, so far as there is any, and
also do the work. The system exists in Turkey,
Egypt, Persia, and other Eastern countries, and
in a modified form in British India. After slav-
ery, it is accounted the worst of all systems, be-
cause the government can fix the rent at what it
pleases, and it is difficult to distinguish between
rent and taxes.
