# Conscious Agreements Framework

> Understanding the agreements you've made — consciously and unconsciously — and finding pathways to conscious choice.

## What This Is

A private knowledge base exploring how "law" is actually **agreement** — and how understanding this reframe empowers you to navigate legal landscapes with awareness rather than assumption.

Most people move through life bound by agreements they never consciously entered:
- Terms they "accepted" without reading
- Contracts implied by behavior rather than signature  
- Jurisdictions claimed through residence rather than consent
- Obligations assumed through words they didn't know had special legal meanings

This framework helps you see these agreements clearly, understand their actual terms, and discover your options.

## Core Concepts

### Everything is Agreement

What appears as immutable "law" is often contractual in nature. Statutes, regulations, even citizenship — all rest on some form of consent, whether explicit or implied.

### Conscious vs. Unconscious

An agreement you enter with full knowledge and intent is fundamentally different from one you stumbled into. Bringing unconscious agreements into conscious awareness is the first step toward choice.

### Definitions Matter

Legal terms don't mean what you think. "Person," "resident," "understand," "your" — each has a precise legal definition that may differ dramatically from everyday usage. Black's Law Dictionary is essential.

### Consideration is Essential

A valid contract requires consideration — something of value exchanged by both parties. Without it, there's no contract. This principle alone reveals the invalidity of many "agreements" people believe bind them.
