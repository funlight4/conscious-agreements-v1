## Part 1: Legal Claims Requiring Verification

### 1.1 The 14th Amendment Ratification Challenge

**Brandon's Claim**: The 14th Amendment was never properly ratified and is therefore invalid.

**Research Needed**:
- Congressional Record from 1866-1868

**Key Questions**:
- What specific procedural defects are claimed?
- Have courts addressed these claims directly?
- What is the success rate of this argument in court?
- Are there alternative legal theories with better support?

**Risk Assessment**: 
- Courts typically view this as a "political question" doctrine issue
- May be seen as frivolous argument
- Could damage credibility of other arguments

### 1.2 Two Types of Citizenship Theory

**Brandon's Claim**: The Slaughterhouse Cases established two distinct citizenships: state and federal.

**Research Needed**:
- Complete text of Slaughterhouse Cases (83 U.S. 36 (1873))

- Success stories using this distinction
- Counter-arguments and their effectiveness

**Key Questions**:
- How do modern courts interpret this distinction?

- What are the limitations of this approach?

### 1.3 Non-Resident Alien Tax Status

**Brandon's Claim**: One can be a non-resident alien while physically present in the United States.

**Research Needed**:
- 26 USC 7701 complete analysis
- IRS revenue rulings on the subject
- Tax court decisions
- Criminal tax prosecution cases
- IRS enforcement statistics

**Key Questions**:
- What is IRS's current enforcement position?

### Final Thoughts

Brandon Joe Williams' Contract Killer 2.0 system represents a radical reimagining of the individual's relationship with legal and governmental systems. While intellectually fascinating and potentially empowering, it requires:

- **Exceptional dedication** to learning and implementation
- **Significant risk tolerance** for legal and practical challenges
- **Strong support network** for navigation and crisis management
- **Financial resources** for potential legal costs
- **Flexibility** to adjust strategies based on results
- **Patience** for a long-term transformation process

The system's effectiveness appears highly dependent on individual circumstances, geographic location, local official attitudes, and implementation quality. Anyone considering this path should conduct extensive personal research, consult with legal professionals familiar with these concepts, and carefully weigh risks against potential benefits.

The questions raised by Brandon's work - about consent, contract, citizenship, and individual sovereignty - are important regardless of whether one chooses to implement his specific strategies. These concepts challenge us to think deeply about the nature of our relationships with institutions and our understanding of personal freedom and responsibility.

**Ultimate Recommendation**: Treat this as an advanced course in legal theory and civil philosophy. Study deeply, think critically, research thoroughly, and make informed decisions based on your specific circumstances and risk tolerance. The journey of understanding these concepts may be valuable regardless of whether you choose full implementation.
