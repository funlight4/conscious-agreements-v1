Hun, 446, 4 N.Y.S. 25; Carpenter v. Beal-McDonnell
& Co., D.C.Ark., 222 F. 453, 460.
"Gaming" and "gambling," in statutes, are similar in
meaning, and either one comprehends the idea that, by a
bet, by chance, by some exercise of skill, or by the trail,
spiring of some event unknown until it occurs, something
of value is, as the conclusion of premises agreed, to be
transferred from a loser to a winner. Bish.St.Crimes, §
858. Town of Eros v. Powell, 137 La. 342, 68 So. 632, 634;
Reinmiller v. State, 93 Fla. 462, 111 So. 633, 635.
"Gaming" is properly the act or engagement of the play-
ers. If by-standers or other third persons put up a stake
or wager among themselves, to go to one or the other
according to the result of the game, this is more correctly
termed "betting."

low a prescribed sum, or which is subject to spe-
cific exceptions. The terms "general" and "spe-

longing to such class. Van Riper v. Parsons, 40
N.J.Law, 1; Mathis v. Jones, 84 Ga. 804, 11 S.E.
1018; Brooks v. Hyde, 37 Cal. 376; Arms v. Ayer,
192 Ill. 601, 61 N.E. 851, 58 L.R.A. 277, 85 Am.St.

A law, framed in general terms, restricted to no locality,
and operating equally upon all of a group of objects, which,
having regard to the purposes of the legislation, are distin-
guished by characteristics sufficiently marked and impor-
tant to make them a class by themselves, is not a special
or local law, but a general law. Jones v. Power County, 27
Idaho, 656, 150 P. 35, 37; Scarbrough v. Wooten, 23 N.M.
616, 170 P. 743; Toombs v. Sharkey, 140 Miss. 676, 106 So.

only of any debt due in respect of the particular
chattel, but of any balance that may be due on

law, depends entirely upon contract, express or
implied, from the special usage of dealing between
the parties. Wharton. Crommelin v. Railroad
Co., 10 Bosw., N.Y., 80; McKenzie v. Nevius, 22 Me.
150, 38 Am.Dec. 291; Brooks v. Bryce, 21 Wend.,

mento Municipal Utility Dist., D.C.Cal., 17 F.Supp.

## GENERAL WORDS

Such words of a descriptive
character as are used in conveyances in order to
convey, not only the specific property described,
appurtenances which may possibly belong to the
property conveyed.
Such words are in general unnecessary; but are properly
used when there are any easements or privileges reputed to
belong to the property not legally appurtenant to it.
Such words are rendered unnecessary by the English
conveyancing act of 1881, under which they are presumed to
be included.
See, as to the effect of such words in deeds, 4 M. & S.
423; in a will; 1 P.Wms. 302; in a lease; 2 Moo. 592; in
a release; 3 Mod. 277; isn a covenant; 3 Moo. 703; in a
statute; 1 Bla.Com. 88; 2 Co. 46.

eral things as what is particular is among things
particular. 11 Coke, 59b.

cial follow. Reg.Brev.; Branch, Princ.

cial things take from generals. Halk.Lat.Max.
GENERALIS CLAUSULA NON PORRIGITUR
AD EA QUJEANTEA SPECIALITER SUNT COM- •
PREHENSA. A general clause does not extend
to those things which are previously provided
for specially. 8 Coke, 154b. Therefore, where a
deed at the first contains special words, and after-
wards concludes in general words, both words, as
well general as special, shall stand.

itself passes to the donee, while in the case of a trust the
actual, beneficial, or equitable title passes to the cestui que

## GOVERNMENT

From the Latin gubernaculum.
Signifies the instrument, the helm, whereby the
ship to which the state was compared, was guided
on its course by the "gubernator" or helmsman,
and in that view, the government is but an agency
of the state, distinguished as it must be in accur-
ate thought from its scheme and machinery of
government. State v. Chase, 175 Minn. 259, 220
N.W. 951, 953.
The system of polity in a state; that form of
fundamental rules and principles by which a na-
tion or state is governed, or by which individual

zens and public officers are prescribed and de-
fined, as a monarchical government, a republican
government, etc. Webster.
An empire, kingdom, state or independent politi-
cal community; as in the phrase, "Compacts be-
tween independent governments."
The sovereign or supreme power in a state or

The machinery by which the sovereign power
in a state expresses its will and exercises its func-
tions; or the framework of political institutions,

executive, judicial, legislative, and administrative
business of the state is carried on.
The whole class or body of office-holders or
functionaries considered in the aggregate, upon
whom devolves the executive, judicial, legislative,
and administrative business of the state. Stokes

cieties formed in England under 3 & 4 Wm. IV.
c. 14, 7 & 8 Vict. c. 83, 16 & 17 Vict. c. 45, and 27
& 28 Vict. c. 43, to enable the industrious classes

## GOVERNMENT DE FACTO

A government of
fact. A government actually exercising power
and control in the state, as opposed to the true
and lawful government; a government not es-
tablished according to the constitution of the state,
or not lawfully entitled to recognition or suprem-
acy, but which has nevertheless supplanted or
displaced the government de jure. A government
deemed unlawful, or deemed wrongful or unjust,
which, nevertheless, receives presently habitual
obedience from the bulk of the community. Aust.
Jur. 324.
There are several degrees of what is called "de facto gov-
ernment." Such a government, in its highest degree,
assumes a character very closely resembling that of a law-
ful government. This is when the usurping government
expels the regular authorities from their customary seats
and functions, and establishes itself in their place, and so
guishing characteristic of such a government is that adher-
ents to it in war against the government de jure do not
incur the penalties of treason; and, under certain limita-
tions, obligations assumed by it in behalf of the country or
otherwise will, in general, be respected by the government
de jure when restored.
Such a government might be more aptly denominated a
"government of paramount force," being maintained by
active military power against the rightful authority of an
established and lawful government; and obeyed in civil
matters by private citizens. They are usually administered
directly by military authority, but they may be adminis-
tered, also, by civil authority, supported more or less by
military force. Thorington v. Smith, 8 Wall. 8, 9, 19 L.Ed.

## GOVERNMENT DE JURE

A government of
right; the true and lawful government; a gov-
ernment established according to the constitution
of the state, and lawfully entitled to recognition
and supremacy and the administration of the
state, but which is actually cut off from power
or control. A government deemed lawful, or
deemed rightful or just, which, nevertheless, has
been supplanted or displaced; that is to say, which
receives not presently (although it received form-
erly) habitual obedience from the bulk of the
community. Aust. Jur. 324.

## GOVERNMENT INSTRUMENTALITY DOC- TRINE

The doctrine that government instru-
mentalities are tax exempt.
The dominion exercised over the estate of deceased full-
blood restricted Creek Indian, would not vest in the gov-
ernment a control sufficient to exempt the estate from
estate taxes under the "government instrumentality doc-
trine". Landman v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue,
C.C.A.10, 123 F.2d 787, 789.
One owning and operating trucks under contract with
federal government for transportation of mail held not
entitled to have trucks exempted from state motor vehicle

States government. Moody v. Louwein, Tex.Civ.App., 300
S. W. 957, 958.

a state may lawfully perform or authorize and,
as applied to the federal government, it is its ev-
ery action within its constitutional power. Orme

757, 762. A step physically taken by persons

## GRANGER CASES

A name applied to six cases
decided by the supreme court of the United States
in 1876, which are reported in Munn v. Illinois, 94
U.S. 113, 24 L.Ed. 77; Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v.
Iowa, 94 U.S. 155, 24 L.Ed. 94; Peik v. Ry. Co., 94
U.S. 165, 24 L.Ed. 97; Chicago, M. & St. P. R. Co.
v. Ackley, 94 U.S. 179, 24 L.Ed. 99; Winona &
St. Peter R. Co. v. Blake, 94 U.S. 180, 24 L.Ed. 99;
those most frequently cited being Munn v. Illinois,
and C., B. & Q. R. Co. v. Iowa. They are so called
because they arose out of an agitation commenced
by the grangers which resulted in the enactment
of statutes for the regulation of the tolls and
charges of common carriers, warehousemen, and
the proprietors of elevators.
The enforcement of these acts was resisted and their con-
stitutionality questioned. The supreme court affirmed the
common-law doctrine that private property appropriated by
the owner to a public use is thereby subjected to public
regulation. They also held that the right of regulation was
not restrained by the prohibition of the fourteenth amend-
ment of the federal constitution against the taking by the
states of private property without due process of law. A
text writer, who was at that time a member of the court,
says of these cases: "But these decisions left undecided
the question how far this legislative power of regulation
belonged to the States, and how far it was in the congress
of the United States"; Miller, Const.U.S. 397.

tion; to assume the responsibility of a guarantor;

## GUARANTY

A collateral agreement for per-
formance of another's undertaking. Kelly-Spring-
field Tire Co. v. Hamilton, 230 Mo.App. 430, 91
debt or performance of obligation if person liable
in first instance fails to make payment or per-
form obligation. McGee v. F. W. Poe Mfg. Co.,
176 S.C. 288, 180 S.E. 48, 51, 99 A.L.R. 1468. An
undertaking by one person to be answerable for
the payment of some debt, or the due performance
of some contract or duty, by another person, who
himself remains liable to pay or perform the same.
Story, Prom. Notes, § 457. A promise to answer
for the debt, default, or miscarriage of another
person. Civil Code Cal. § 2787.
A guaranty is a contract that some particular thing shall
be done exactly as it is agreed to be done, whether it is to
be done by one person or another, and whether there be a
prior or principal contractor or not. Redfield v. Haight,
27 Conn. 31.
The definition of a "guaranty," by text-writers, is an
undertaking by one person that another shall perform his
contract or fulfill his obligation, or that, if he does not, the
guarantor will do it for him. A guarantor of a bill or note
is said to be one who engages that ,the note shall be paid,
but is not an indorser or surety. Gridley v. Capen, 72
Ill. 13.
Synonyms
The terms guaranty and suretyship are sometimes used
interchangeably; but they should not be confounded. The
contract of a guarantor is his own separate contract. It is
in the nature of a warranty by him that the thing guar-
antied to be done by the principal shall be done, not merely
an engagement jointly with the principal to do the thing.
The original contract of the principal is not his contract,
and he is not bound to take notice of its non-performance.
Durham v. Manrow, 2 N.Y. 548; Nading v. McGregor, 121
Ind. 465, 23 N.E. 283, 6 L.R.A. 686; Hoosier Brick Co. v.
Floyd County Bank, 64 Ind.App. 445, 116 N.E. 87, 90; W. T.
Rawleigh Co. v. Salter, 31 Ga.App. 329, 120 S.E. 679, 681.
Guaranty and warranty are derived from the same root,
and are in fact etymologically the same word, the "g" of
the Norman French being interchangeable with the English
"w." They are often used colloquially and in commercial
transactions as having the same signification, as where a
piece of machinery or the produce of an estate is "guar-
antied" for a term of years, "warranted" being the more
appropriate term in such a case. Accumulator Co. v. Dubu-
que St. R. Co., Iowa, 64 P. 70, 12 C.C.A. 37; Martinez v.
Earnshaw, 36 Wkly.Notes Cas., Pa., 502. A distinction is
also sometimes made in commercial usage, by which the
term "guaranty" is understood as a collateral warranty
(often a conditional one) against some default or event in
the future, while the term "warranty" is taken as meaning
an absolute undertaking in prcesenti, against the defect, or
for the quantity or quality contemplated by the parties in
the subject-matter of the contract. Sturges v. Bank of
Circleville, 11 Ohio St. 169, 78 Am.Dec. 296. But in strict
legal usage the two terms are widely distinguished in this,
that a warranty is an absolute undertaking or liability on
the part of the warrantor, and the contract is void unless
it is strictly and literally performed, while a guaranty is
a promise, entirely collateral to the original contract, and
not imposing any primary liability on the guarantor, but
binding him to be answerable for the failure or default of
another. Masons' Union L. Ins. Ass'n v. Brockman, 20 Ind.
App. 206, 50 N.E. 493.
Absolute guaranty. An unconditional undertaking by a
guarantor that debtor will pay debt or perform the obliga-
tion. An unconditional promise of payment or perform-
ance of principal contract on default of principal debtor or
obligor. Robey v. Walton Lumber Co., 17 Wash.2d 242, 135
P.2d 95, 102, 145 A.L.R. 924.
Collateral guaranty. A contract by which the guarantor
undertakes, in case the principal fails to do what he has
promised or undertaken to do, to pay damages for such
failure; distinguished from an engagement of suretyship
in this respect, that a surety undertakes to do the very
thing which the principal has promised to do, in case the
latter defaults. Woody v. Haworth, 24 Ind.App. 634, 57
N.E. 272; Nading v. McGregor, 121 Ind. 470, 23 N.E. 283,
6 L.R.A. 686.
extraneous event, beyond the mere default of the principal,
and generally upon notice of the guaranty, notice of the
principal's default, and reasonable diligence in exhausting
proper remedies against the principal. Yager v. Title Co.,
112 Ky. 932, 66 S. W. 1027; Tobacco Co. v. Heid, D.C.
Alaska, 62 F. 962; Wall v. Eccles, 61 Utah, 247, 211 P. 702,
Continuing guaranty. One relating to a future liability
of the principal, under successive transactions, which either
continue his liability or from time to time renew it after
it has been satisfied. Sewing Mach. Co. v. Courtney, 141
Cal. 6'74, 75 P. 296; Buck v. Burk, 18 N.Y. 340; German
Say. Bank v. Drake, Iowa, 79 N.W. 121; Glaser, Kohn &
Co. v. U. S., C.C.A./11., 224 F. 84, 86; Hirning v. Jacob-
sen, 51 S.D. 270, 213 N.W. 505, 507.
Special guaranty. A guaranty which is available only to
the particular person to whom it is offered or addressed;
as distinguished from a general guaranty, which will op-
erate in favor of any person who may accept it. Everson
v. Gere, 40 Hun, N.Y., 250; Tidioute Say. Bank v. Libbey,
101 Wis. 193, 77 N.W. 182, 70 Am.St.Rep. 907; Jobes v.
Miller, 201 Mo.App. 45, 209 S.W. 549, 550.
Guaranty. company. A corporation authorized to trans-
act the business of entering into contracts of guaranty and
suretyship; as, one which, for fixed premiums, becomes
surety on judicial bonds, fidelity bonds, and the like. See
'Etna L. Ins. Co. v. Coulter, 25 Ky.L.Rep. 193, 74 S.W.

## GUARANTY FUND

Statutes have made provi-
sion for depositors' guaranty funds to be raised,
in whole or in part, by assessments on banks and
to be used to pay the depositors of an insolvent
bank. Noble State Bank v. Haskell, 219 U.S. 104,

## GUARDAGE

A state of wardship.

## GUARDIAN

A guardian is a person lawfully
invested with the power, and charged with the
duty, of taking care of the person and managing
the property and rights of another person, who,
for some peculiarity of status, or defect of age,
understanding, or self-control, is considered in-
capable of administering his own affairs. Bass
v. Cook, 4 Port., Ala., 392; Sparhawk v. Allen, 21
N.H. 27; Burger v. Frakes, 67 Iowa, 460, 23 N.W.
746; Fleming v. Leibe, 95 N.J.Eq. 129, 122 A. 616.
One who legally has the care and management
of the person, or the estate, or both, of a child
during its minority. Reeve, Dom. Rel. 311.
This term might be appropriately used to designate the
person charged with the care and control of idiots, lunatics,
habitual drunkards, spendthrifts, and the like; but such
person is, under many of the statutory systems authorizing
the appointment, styled "committee," and in common us-
age the name "guardian" is applied only to one having the
care and management of a minor.
Classification
A testamentary guardian is one appointed by the deed or
last will of the child's father; while a guardian by election
is one chosen by the infant himself in a case where he
would otherwise be without one.
A general guardian is one who has the general care and
control of the person and estate of his ward; while a
special guardian is one who has specie] or limited powers
and duties with respect to his ward, e. g., a guardian who
versa, or a guardian ad litem.
A domestic guardian is one appointed at the place where
the ward is legally domiciled; while a foreign guardian de-
rives his authority from appointment by the courts of an-
other state, and generally has charge only of such property
as may be located within the jurisdiction of the power ap-
pointing him.
A guardian ad litem is a guardian appointed by a court of
justice to prosecute or defend for an infant in any suit to
which he may be a party, 2 Steph.Comm. 342; Crawford
v. Amusement Syndicate Co., Mo., 37 S.W.2d 581, 584.
Most commonly appointed for infant defendants, infant
plaintiffs generally suing by next friend. This kind of
guardian has no right to interfere with the infant's person
or property. 2 Steph.Comm. 343; Richter v. Leiby, 107
Wis. 404, 83 N.W. 694; Morris v. Standard Oil Co., 192
Cal. 343, 219 P. 998, 1000, 30 A.L.R. 1103.
A guardian by appointment of court has custody of the
infant until the attainment of full age. 2 Steph.Comm.
341; 2 Kent, Comm. 226.
A guardian by nature is the father, and,,,on nis death,
the mother, of a child. 1 Bl.Comm. 461; 2 Kent, Comm.
219; Daniels v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 135 Pa.Super.
450, 5 A.2d 608, 611. This guardianship extends only to the
custody of the person of the child to the age of twenty-one
years. Sometimes called "natural guardian," but this is
rather a popular than a technical mode of expression. 2
Steph.Comm. 337; Kline v. Beebe, 6 Conn. 500; Mauro v.
Ritchie, 16 Fed.Cas. 1171.
A guardian by statute is a guardian appointed for a
child by the deed or last will of the father, and who has
the custody both of his person and estate until the attain-
ment of full age. This kind of guardianship is founded on
the statute of 12 Car. II. c. 24, and ,has been pretty exten-
sively adopted in this country. 1 Bl.Comm. 462; 2 Steph.
Comm. 339, 340; 2 Kent, Comm. 224-226; Huson v. Green,
88 Ga. 722, 16 S.E. 255.
A guardian for nurture is the father, or, at his decease,
the mother, of a child. This kind of guardianship extends
only to the person, and determines when the infant arrives
at the age of fourteen. 2 Kent, Comm. 221; 1 Bl.Comm.
461; 2 Steph.Comm. 338; Mauro v. Ritchie, 16 Fed.Cas.
1171; Arthurs' Appeal, 1 Grant Cas., Pa., 56.
Guardian in chivalry. In the tenure by knight's service,
in the feudal law, if the heir of the feud was under the age
of twenty-one, being a male, or fourteen, being a female,
the lord was entitled to the wardship (and marriage) of
the heir, and was called the "guardian in chivalry." This
wardship consisted in having the custody of the body and
lands of such heir, without any account of the profits. 2
Bl.Comm. 67.
Guardian in socage. At the common law, this was a
species of guardian who had the custody of lands coming
to the infant by descent, as also of the infant's person,
until the latter reached the age of fourteen. Such guard-
ian was always "the next of kin to whom the inheritance
cannot possibly descend." 1 Bl.Comm. 461; 2 Steph.Comm.
338; Byrne v. Van Hoesen, 5 Johns., N.Y., 67; Combs v.
Jackson, 2 Wend., N.Y., 157, 19 Am.Dec. 568.
Natural guardian. The father of a child, or the mother if
the father be dead.
"Guardian de son tort," sometimes described as "quasi

ization, to protect and promote the interests of

In medieval history these fraternities or guilds played
an important part in the government of some states; as at
Florence, in the thirteenth and following centuries, where
they chose the council of government of the city. The
