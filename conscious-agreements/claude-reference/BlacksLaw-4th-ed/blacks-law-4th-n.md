## NATION

A people, or aggregation of men, exist-
ing in the form of an organized jural society,
usually inhabiting a distinct portion of the earth,
speaking the same language, using the same cus-
toms, possessing historic continuity, and distin-
guished from other like groups by their racial
origin and characteristics, and generally, but not
necessarily, living under the same government and
sovereignty. Montoya v. U. S., -180 U.S. 261, 21 S.
Ct. 358, 45 L.Ed. 521; Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet.
539, 8 L.Ed. 483; Republic of Honduras v. Soto, 112
N.Y. 310, 19 N.E. 845, 2 L.R.A. 642.
Besides the element of autonomy or self-government, that
is, the independence of the community as a whole from the
interference of any foreign power in its affairs or any sub-
jection to such power, it is further necessary to the consti-
tution of a nation that it should be an organized jural
society, that is, both governing its own members by regu-
lar laws, and defining and protecting their rights, and
respecting the rights and duties which attach to it as a
constituent member of the family of nations. Such a soci-
ety, says Vattel, has her affairs and her interests; she
deliberates and takes resolutions in common ; thus becom-
ing a moral person, who possesses an understanding and
will peculiar to herself, and is susceptible of obligations
and rights. Vattel, §1 1, 2.
The words "nation" and "people" are frequently used as
synonyms, but there is a great difference between them.
A nation is an aggregation of men speaking the same lan-
guage, having the same customs, and endowed with cer-
tain moral qualities which distinguish them from other
groups of a like nature. It would follow from this defini-
tion that a nation is destined to form only one state, and
that it constitutes one indivisible whole. Nevertheless, the
history of every age presents us with nations divided into
several states. Thus, Italy was for centuries divided
among several different governments. The people is the
collection of all citizens without distinction of rank or
order. All men living under the same government compose
the people of the state. In relation to the state, the cit-
izens constitute the people; in relation to the human race,
they constitute the nation. A free nation is one not sub-
ject to a foreign government, whatever be the constitution
of the state ; a people is free when all the citizens can par-
ticipate in a certain measure in the direction and in the
examination of public affairs. The people is the political
body brought into existence by community of laws, and
the people may perish with these laws. The nation is the
moral body, independent of political revolutions, because
it is constituted by inborn qualities which render it indis-
soluble. The state is the people organized into a political
body. Lalor, Pol.Enc. s.
In American constitutional -law the word "state"
is applied to the several members of the American
Union, while the word "nation" is applied to the
whole body of the people embraced within the
jurisdiction of the federal government. Cooley,
Const.Lim. 1; Texas v. White, 7 Wall. 720, 19 L.
Ed. 227.

## NATIONAL

Pertaining or relating to a nation as
a whole; commonly applied in American law to
institutions, laws, or affairs of the United States
or its government, as opposed to those of the sev-
eral states.
The term "national" as used in the phrase "na-
tional of the United States" is broader than the
term "citizen". Brassert v. Biddle, D.C.Conn., 59
F.Supp. 457, 462.

## NATIONAL AGENCY

That Mexican government
contributed to capital of association, and was rep-
resented on governing board and even subsi-
dized association did not render association a •"na-
tional agency" that it might claim sovereign im-
munity. The Uxmal, D.C.Mass., 40 F.Supp. 258,
NATIONAL BANK. A bank incorporated and do-
ing business under the laws of the United States,

## NATIONAL EMERGENCY

tween a "state of national emergency" and a
"state of war". Brown v. Bernstein, D.C.Pa., 49
F.Supp. 728, 732.

## NATIONAL GOVERNMENT

The government of
a whole nation, as distinguished from that of a
local or territorial division of the nation, and also
as distinguished from that of a league or confed-
eration.
"A national government is a government of the people
of a single state or nation, united as a community by what
is termed the 'social compact,' and possessing complete
and perfect supremacy over persons and things, so far as
they can be made the lawful objects of civil government.
A federal government is distinguished from a national gov-
ernment, by its being the government of a community of
independent and sovereign states, united by compact."
Piqua Branch Bank v. Knoup, 6 Ohio St. 393.

## NATIONALITY

That quality or character which
arises from the fact of a person's belonging to a
nation or state.
Nationality determines the political status of the individ-
ual, especially with reference to allegiance; while domicile
determines his civil status. Nationality arises either by
birth or by naturalization. According to Savigny, "nation-
ality" is also used as opposed to "territoriality," for the
purpose of distinguishing the case of a nation having no
national territory; e. g., the Jews. 8 Say. Syst. § 346;
Westl.Priv.Int. Law, 5.

## NATIONALIZACION

Minn. 217, 199 N.W. 910.

N.Y., 137 F.2d 903, 905.

tinguish it from Fitzherbert's Natura Brevium, a
later work, cited as "F. N. B.," or "Fitzh. Nat.
Brev."

## NATURAL LAW

This expression, "natural law,"
or jus naturale, was largely used in the philosophi-
cal speculations of the Roman jurists of the Anto-
nine age, and was intended to denote a system of
rules and principles for the guidance of human
conduct which, independently of enacted law or of
the systems peculiar to any one people, might be
discovered by the rational intelligence of man, and
would be found to grow out of and conform to his
nature, meaning by that word his whole mental,
moral, and physical constitution. The point of de-
parture for this conception was the Stoic doctrine
of a life ordered "according to nature," which in
its turn rested upon the purely supposititious ex-
istence, in primitive times, of a "state of nature;"
that is, a condition of society in which men uni-
versally were governed solely by a rational and
consistent obedience to the needs, impulses, and
promptings of their true nature, such nature being
as yet undefaced by dishonesty, falsehood, or in-
dulgence of the baser passions. Maine, Anc.Law,
50, et seq.; Jus Naturale.

## NATURAL LIFE

The period of a person's ex-
istence considered as continuing until terminated
by physical dissolution or death occurring in the
course of nature; used in contradistinction to that
juristic and artificial conception of life as an ag-
gregate of legal rights or the possession of a legal
personality, which could be terminated by "civil,
death,"(q. v.), that is, that extinction of personali-
ty which resulted from entering a monastery or
being attainted of treason or felony. See People

more restricted sense, viz., subject to the ebb and
flow of the tide. Luscher v. Reynolds, 153 Or.

"The doctrine of the common law as to the navigability
There [In England] no waters are navigable in fact, or at
least to any considerable extent, which are not subject to
the tide, and from this circumstance tide-water and navi-
gable water there signify substantially the same thing.
But in this country the case is widely different. * * *
Those rivers must be regarded as public navigable rivers,
in law, which are navigable in fact." The Daniel Ball, 10
Wall. 563, 19 L.Ed. 999.
Waters are "navigable" when they are used, or are sus-
ceptible of being used, in their ordinary condition, as high-
ways for commerce, over which trade and travel are or may
be conducted in customary modes of trade and travel on
water. United States v. Appalachian Electric Power Co.,
D.C.Va., 23 F.Supp. 83.

## NAVIGABLE IN FACT

Streams or lakes are
navigable in fact when they are used or are sus-
ceptible of being used in their natural and ordina-
ry condition as highways for commerce over which
trade and travel are or may be conducted in the
customary modes of trade and travel on water.
Taylor Fishing Club v. Hammett, Tex.Civ.App., 88
S.W.2d 127, 129.

## NAVIGABLE RIVER OR STREAM

At common
law, a river or stream in which the tide ebbs and
flows, or as far as the tide ebbs and flows. 3 Kent,
Comm. 412, 414, 417, 418; 2 Hil. Real Prop. 90,
91. But as to the definition in American law, see
Navigable, supra.

## NAVIGABLE WATERS

Those waters which af-
ford a channel for useful commerce. The Mon-
tello, 20 Wall. 430, 22 L.Ed. 391.
See, also, Navigable, supra.
In several states so long as a stream or body of water
may be put to public use it is "navigable" whether it can
be uses for commercial navigation or not. U. S. v. Holt
State Bank, C.C.A.Minn., 294 F. 161, 166; State v. Korrer,
127 Minn. 60, 148 N.W. 617, 618, L.R.A.1916C, 139; State
v. Akers, 92 Kan. 169, 140 P. 637, 640, Ann.Cas.1916B, 543.
Any natural waters that are usable for rowing or canoeing
are "navigable," and as such open to the public for hunt-
ing or fishing, notwithstanding water is a shallow, muddy
lake or marsh. Baker v. Voss, 217 Wis. 415, 259 N.W. 413.
Contra : To be "navigable," waters must be navigable for
some purpose useful to trade or agriculture and susceptible
of use for purposes of commerce, or possess capacity for
valuable floatage in transportation to market of products of
country through which it runs, a mere theoretical or po-
tential navigability, or one that is temporary, precarious,
unprofitable, or which requires artificial improvement, be-
ing insufficient. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Carroll,
Tex.Civ.App., 106 S.W.2d 757, 759. The test of "naviga-
bility" is whether there is in the stream capacity for use
for the purpose of transportation valuable to the public.
American Red Cross v. Hinson, 173 Tenn. 667, 122 S.W.2d
433, 435. Navigability is not imparted by ability to float
small boats, such as skiffs or canoes. United States v.
Appalachian Electric Power Co., D.C.Va., 23 F.Supp. 83.
Generally, a lake that is chiefly valuable for fishing or
pleasure boats of small size is not "navigable." Taylor
Fishing Club & Hammett, Tex.Civ.App., 88 S.W.2d 127, 129,

## NAVIGABLE WATERS OF THE UNITED STATES

Waters are "navigable waters of the
United States" when they form in their ordinary
condition by themselves, or by uniting with other
waters, a continued highway over which commerce
is or may be carried on with other states or for-
eign countries in the customary modes in which
such commerce is conducted by water. United
States v. Appalachian Electric Power Co., D.C.
Va., 23 F.Supp. 83,
NAVIGATE. To journey by water; to go in a
vessel; to sail or manage a vessel; to use the
waters as a highway for commerce or communi-
cation; ply. Hence, to direct one's course through
any medium; to steer, especially to operate an
airplane or airship. United States v. Monstad,
C.C.A.Cal., 134 F.2d 986, 987, 988.
NAVIGATION, The act or the science or the bus-
iness of traversing the sea or other waters in
ships or vessels. Pollock v. Cleveland Ship Build-
ing Co., 56 Ohio St. 655, 47 N.E. 582; The Silvia,
171 U.S. 462, 19 S.Ct. 7, 43 L.Ed. 241; Laurie v.
Douglass, 15 Mees. & W. 746.
Regular navigation. In this phrase, the word
"regular" may be used in contradistinction to "oc-
casional," rather than to "unlawful," and refer
to vessels that, alone or with others, constitute
lines, and not merely to such as are regular in the
sense of being properly documented under the
laws of the country to which they belong. The
Steamer Smidt, 16 Op.Attys.Gen. 276.
Rules of navigation. Rules and regulations
adopted by commercial nations to govern the steer-
ing and management of vessels approaching each
other at sea so as to avoid the danger of collision

fecting speed with reference to distance within
which boat in fog could be brought to stop, before

NE .EXEAT. A writ which forbids the person to
whom it is addressed to leave the country, the

The word has no hard and fast meaning, but varies with
the accustomed manner of living of the parties. Smitti v.
Roth Cadillac Co., 145 Pa.Super. 292, 21 A.2d 127, 130.
"Necessaries" consist of food, drink, clothing, medical
attention, and a suitable place of residence, and they are
regarded as necessaries in the absolute sense of the word;
however, liability for necessaries is not limited to articles
required to sustain life; it extends to articles which would
ordinarily be necessary and suitable, in view of the rank,

What constitutes "necessaries" for which an admiralty
lien will attach depends upon what is reasonably needed in
the ship's business, regard being had to the character of
the voyage and the employment in which the vessel is be-
ing used. Walker Skageth Food Stores v. The Bavois, D.C.
N.Y., 43 F.Supp. 109, 110, 111.
In the case of ships the term "necessaries" means such

That is necessary which
cannot be otherwise.

## NECESSARIUS

Lat. Necessary; unavoidable;
indispensable; not admitting of choice or the ac-
tion of the will; needful.

## NECESSARY

This word must be considered in
the connection in which it is used, as it is a word
susceptible of various meanings. It may import
absolute physical necessity or inevitability, or it
may import that which is only convenient, useful,
appropriate, suitable, proper, or conducive to the
end sought. It is an adjective expressing degrees,
and may express mere convenience or that which
is indispensable or an absolute physical necessity.
It may mean something which in the accomplish-
ment of a given object cannot be dispensed with,
or it may mean something reasonably useful and
proper, and of greater or lesser benefit or con-
venience, and its force and meaning must be de-
termined with relation to the particular object
sought. Kay County Excise Board v, Atchison, T.
& S. F. R. Co., 185 Okl. 327, 91 P.2d 1087, 1088.
In eminent domain proceedings, it means land

determining such damages. Polk v. Krenning, Mo.
App., 2 S.W.2d 107, 109.

## NECESSITAS

Lat. Necessity; a force, power,
or influence which compels one to act against his
will. Calvin.

## NECESSITAS CULPABILIS

Culpable necessity;
unfortunate necessity; necessity which, while it
excuses the act done under its compulsion, does
not leave the doer entirely free from blame. The
necessity which compels a man to kill another in
self-defense is thus distinguished from that which
requires the killing of a felon. See 4 Bl. Comm.
NECESSITAS EST LEX TEMPORIS ET LOCI.
Necessity is the law of time and of place. 1 Hale,
P. C. 54.
NECESSITAS EXCUSAT AUT EXTENUAT DE-
LICTUM IN CAPITALIBUS, QUOD NON OPER-
ATUR IDEM IN CIVILIBUS. Necessity excuses
or extenuates a delinquency in capital cases, which

## NECESSITAS NON HABET LEGEM

Necessity
has no law. Plowd. 18a. "Necessity shall be a
good excuse in our law, and in every other law."
Id.

## NECESSITAS PUBLICA MAJOR EST QUAM PRIVATA

Public necessity is greater than pri-
vate. "Death," it has been observed, "is the last
and furthest point of particular necessity, and the
law imposes it upon every subject that he prefer
the urgent service of his king and country before
the safety of his life." Noy, Max. 34; Broom, Max.

## NECESSITAS QUOD COGIT, DEFENDIT

Ne-
cessity defends or justifies what it compels. 1
Hale, P. C. 54. Applied to the acts of a sheriff,
or ministerial officer, in the execution of his of-
fice. Broom, Max. 14.
NECESSITAS SUB LEGE NON CONTINETUR,
QUIA QUOD ALIAS NON EST LICITUM NEC-
ESSITAS FACIT LICITUM. 2 Inst. 326. Neces-
sity is not restrained by law; since what other-
wise is not lawful necessity makes lawful.

## NECESSITAS VINCIT LEGEM

Necessity over-
rules the law. Hob. 144; Cooley, Const. Lim. 4th
Ed. 747.

## NECESSITAS VINCIT LEGEM; LEGUM VIN- CULA IRRIDET

only primitive physical needs, things absolutely
indispensable to human existence and decency, but
those things, also, which are in fact necessary to
the particular person left without support. State
v. Waller, 90 Kan. 829, 136 P. 215, 216, 49 L.R.A.,
N.S., 588.

## NECESSITUDO

Lat. In the civil law, an obliga-
tion; a close connection; relationship by blood.
Calvin.

## NECESSITY

Controlling force; irresistible com-
pulsion; a power or impulse so great that it ad-
mits no choice of conduct.
When it is said that an act is done "under necessity,"
it may be, in law, either of three kinds of necessity : (1)
The necessity of preserving one's own life, which will ex-
cuse a homicide; (2) the necessity of obedience, as to the
laws, or the obedience of one not sui juris to his superior ;
(3) the necessity caused by the act of God or a stranger.
See Jacob; Mozley & Whiteley.

The quality or state of being necessary, in its primary
sense signifying that which makes an act or event un-
avoidable. Spreckels v. City and County of San Fran-
cisco, 76 Cal.App. 267, 244 P. 919, 922; In re Washington
Ave. in Borough of Chatham, 5 N.J.Misc. 858, 139 A. 239,
A constraint upon the will whereby a person is urged
to do that which his judgment disapproves, and which,
it is to be presumed, his will (if left to itself) would
reject. A man, therefore, is excused for those actions
which are done through unavoidable force and compulsion.
Wharton.
In determining what is a work of "necessity" excepted
from the operation of the Sunday law, the necessity meant
is not a physical or absolute necessity, but a moral fitness
or propriety of the work and labor done under the circum-
stances of the particular case, and whether or not the act
is morally fit and proper is usually a question of fact for
the jury under proper instructions. Lakeside Inn Corpora-.
tion v. Commonwealth, 134 Va. 696, 114 S.E. 769, 771; Na-
tural Gas Products Co. v. Thurman, 205 Ky. 100, 265 S.W.
475, 477. The term "necessity" means an economical and
moral necessity, rather than an unavoidable physical neces-
R.A.1918B, 1109. The necessity which must exist depends on
what the general public in its ordinary modes of doing
business regards as necessary. Gray v. Commonwealth,
171 Ky. 269, 188 S.W. 354, 355, L.R.A. 1917B, 93. "Works
of necessity" include whatever is needful for the good
health, order, or comfort of the community. State v.

venience and necessity, is not used in the sense of being
essential or absolutely indispensable but merely that cer-
tificate is reasonably necessary for public good. Alabama
Public Service Commission v. Crow, 247 Ala. 120, 22 So.2d
721, 724.
To fulfill requirements for easement of right of way of
necessity, the necessity must be actual, real, and reason-
able, as distinguished from inconvenience, but it need not
be absolute and irresistible necessity. Brasington v. Wil-
liams, 143 S.C. 223, 141 S.E. 375, 383.
"Necessity" when used in relation to power of eminent
domain does not mean absolute necessity, but only rea-
sonable necessity. Chicago & N. W. R. Co. v. City of
Racine, 200 Wis. 170, 227 N.W. 859, 861.
The "necessity" of and appurtenance for the beneficial
use of leased premises, which will entitle the lessee there-
to, is not an absolute necessity in the sense that it must
be completely indispensable, but is a real necessity and
not a mere convenience or advantage. Raynes v. Stevens,
219 Mass. 556, 107 N.E. 398, 399.
Public necessity. Of a municipal improvement,
needed for reasonable convenience, facility, and
completeness in accomplishing a public purpose.
In re Washington Ave. in Borough of Chatham,
5 N.J.Misc. 858, 139 A. 239, 240. With reference

venience. Delaware, L. & W. R. Co. v. Van Sant-
voord, D.C.N.Y., 232 F. 978, 983.

In a statute against "needless" kill-
ing or mutilation of any animal, this term denotes
an act done without any useful motive, in a spirit
of wanton cruelty, or for the mere pleasure of
destruction. Grise v. State, 37 Ark. 460; Hunt v.
State, 3 Ind.App. 383, 29 N.E. 933; State v. Bogard-
us, 4 Mo.App. 215.

## NEGATIO CONCLUSIONIS EST ERROR IN LEGE

Wing. 268. The denial of a conclusion is
error in law.

## NEGATIO DESTRUIT NEGATIONEM, ET AM- BIE FACIUNT AFFIRMATIONEM

A negative
destroys a negative, and both make an affirmative.
Co. Litt. 146b. Lord Coke cites this as a rule of
grammatical construction, not always applying in
law.

## NEGATIO DUPLEX EST AFFIRMATIO

A dou-
ble negative is an affirmative.

## NEGATIVE

A denial; a proposition by which
something is denied; a statement in the form of
denial. Two negatives do not make a good issue.
Steph. Pl. 386, 387.
As to negative "Covenant," "Easement," "Serv-
itude," "Statute," and "Testimony," see those titles.

## NEGATIVE AVERMENT

As opposed to the tra-
verse or simple denial of an affirmative allegation,
a negative averment is an allegation of some sub-
stantive fact, e. g., that premises are not in repair,
which, although negative in form, is really affirm•
ative in substance, and the party alleging the fact
of non-repair must prove it. Brown. An aver-
ment in some of the pleadings in a case in which
a negative is asserted. U. S. v. Eisenminger, D.C.
Del., 16 F.2d 816, 819.

## NEGATIVE CONDITION

One by which it is
stipulated that a given thing shall not happen.

A.Pa., 217 F. 366, 368.

## NEGATIVE PREGNANT

In pleading, a nega-
tive implying also an affirmative. Cowell. Such a
form of negative expression as may imply or carry
within it an affirmative. Steph. Pl. 318; Fields v.
State, 134 Ind: 46, 32 N.E. 780; Stone v. Quaal, 36
Minn. 46, 29 N.W. 326.
As if a man be said to have aliened land in fee, and he
says he has not aliened in fee, this is a negative pregnant;
for, though it be true that he has not aliened in fee, yet
it may be that he has made an estate in tail. Cowell. A
"negative pregnant," is a denial in form, but is in fact an
admission, as where the denial in hiec verba includes the
time and place, which are usually immaterial. Hall &
Lyon Furniture Co. v. Torrey, 196 App. Div. 804, 188 N.Y.
S. 486, 487; Green v. Commercial Bank & Trust Co. D.C.
Wyo., 277 F. 527, 528; McIntosh Livestock Co. v. Buffing-
ton, 108 Or. 358, 217 P. 635, 636.
A denial in such form as to imply or express an admis-
sion of the substantial fact which apparently is controvert-
ed; or a denial which, although in the form of a traverse,
really admits the important facts contained in the allega-
tions to which it relates. Cramer v. Aiken, 63 App.D.C.
16, 68 F.2d 761, 762.

## NEGGILDARE

To claim kindred. Jac. L. Dict.

## NEGLECT

May mean to omit, fail, or forbear
to do a thing that can be done, or that is required
to be done, but it may also import an absence of
care or attention in the doing or omission of a giv-
en act. State v. Sheldon, 135 Okl. 278, 276 P. 468,
472; Same v. Butterfield, 138 Oki. 112, 276 P. 473.
And it may mean a designed refusal or unwill-
ingness to perform one's duty. In re Perkins, 234
Mo.App. 716, 117 S.W.2d 686, 692.
The term is used in the law of bailment as syn-
onymous with "negligence." But the latter word
is the closer translation of the Latin "negligentia."
Failure to pay money which the party is bound to pay
without demand. Kimball v. Rowland, 6 Gray, Mass., 224.
An omission to do or perform some work, duty, or act.
Esposito v. St. George Swimming Club, 143 Misc. 15, 255
N.Y.S. 794, 801. Failure to perform or discharge a duty,
covering positive official misdoing or official misconduct
as well as negligence. Commonwealth ex rel. and to Use
of Allegheny County v. De Luca, 131 Pa.Super. 451, 200 A.
712, 714.
Culpable Neglect. In this phrase, the word "culpable"
means not only criminal, but censurable. As he has mere-
ly lost a right of action which he might voluntarily re-
linquish, and has wronged nobody but himself, culpable
neglect to preserve rights conveys the idea of neglect which
exists where the loss can fairly be ascribed to the party's
own carelessness, improvidence, or folly. State ex rel.
Fulton v. Coburn, 133 Ohio St. 192, 12 N.E.2d 471, 477.
Willful Neglect. The neglect of the husband to provide
for his wife the common necessaries of life, he having the
ability to do so; or it is the failure to do so by reason of
idleness, profligacy, or dissipation. Civil Code Cal. § 105.

## NEGLECTED MINOR

One suffering from neg-
lect and in state of want. People v. De Pue, 217
N.Y.S. 205, 206, 217 App.Div. 321.

## NEGLIGENCE

The omission to do something
which a reasonable man, guided by those ordinary
considerations which ordinarily regulate human
affairs, would do, or the doing of something which
a reasonable and prudent man would not do.
Schneeweisz v. Illinois Cent. R. Co., 196 Ill.App.
248, 253; Schneider v. C. H. Little Co., 184 Mich.
315, 151 N.W. 587, 588; Hulley v. Moosbrugger, 88
N.J.L. 161, 95 A. 1007, 1010, L.R.A. 1916C, 1203.
The term refers only to that legal delinquency which
results whenever a man fails to exhibit the care which he
ought to exhibit, whether it be slight, ordinary, or great.
Hazzard v. Chase Nat. Bank of City of New York, 159
Misc. 57, 287 N.Y.S. 541, 552. It is characterized chiefly by
inadvertence, thoughtlessness, inattention, and the like,
while "wantonness" or "recklessness" is characterized by
willfulness. People v. Orr, 243 Mich. 300, 220 N.W. 777,
779. The law of "negligence" is founded on reasonable
conduct or reasonable care under all circumstances of par-
ticular case. Charbonneau v. MacRury, 84 N.H. 501, 153
A. 457, 462, 73 A.L.R. 1266. Doctrine of negligence rests
on duty of every person to exercise due care in his conduct
toward others from which injury may result. Johnson v.
Grand Trunk Western R. Co., 246 Mich. 52, 224 N.W. 448,
449. "Negligence" is not intentional conduct. Gunther v.
Morey Larue Laundry Co., 129 N.J.L. 345, 29 A.2d 713, 714.
Inaction as well as action may be "negligence". Public
Service Co. of New Hampshire v. Elliott, C.C.A.N.H., 123
F.2d 2, 5. It is not act itself, but fact which defines char-
acter of act and makes it legal wrong. Metzger v. Gam-
bill, Tex.Civ.App., 37 S.W.2d 1077, 1078. It is immaterial
to the question of "negligence" whether violated standard
of conduct is established by statute or by the common law.
Armit v. Loveland, C.C.A.Pa., 115 F.2d 308, 311, 312. It is
the failure to do that which a person of ordinary prudence,

considerations which ordinarily regulate conduct of human
affairs, would do, or doing something which such a person
would not do, under like or similar circumstances. McKee

adelphia, B. & W. R. Co., 93 A. 903, 904, 5 Boyce, Del., 389;

ual"-that is, "accidental"-doing or omission to do some-
thing which results in an injury, Root v. Topeka Ry. Co.,
96 Kan. 694, 153 P. 550; and is synonymous with heedless-
ness, carelessness, thoughtlessness, disregard, inattention,
inadvertence, remissness and oversight, Payne v. Vance,
103 Ohio St. 59, 133 N.E. 85, 87.
"Negligence" in official conduct is ordinarily the failure
to use such reasonable care and caution as would be ex-
pected of a prudent man. Hamrick v. McCutcheon, 101 W.
Va. 485, 133 S.E. 127, 129.
Negligence is any culpable omission of a positive duty.
It differs from heedlessness, in that heedlessness is the do-
ing of an act in violation of a negative duty, without ad-
verting to its possible consequences. In both cases there is
inadvertence, and there is breach of duty. Aust. Jur. 630.
Negligence or carelessness signifies want of care, caution,
attention, diligence, or discretion in one having no posi-
tive intention to injure the person complaining thereof.
The words "reckless," "indifferent," "careless," and "wan-
tention, unless when joined with other words which
show that they are to receive an artificial or unusual, if
not an unnatural, interpretation. Lexington v. Lewis, 10
Bush, Ky., 677.
"Negligence" is not synonymous with "incompetency,"
since the competent may be negligent. Alabama City, G.
& A. Ry. Co. v. Bessiere, 190 Ala. 59, 66 So. 805, 806;
Barclay v. Wetmore & Morse Granite Co., 92 Vt. 195, 102 A.

See Care.
Actionable Negligence. See Actionable Negli-
gence.
Collateral Negligence. In the law relating to the
responsibility of an employer or principal for the
negligent acts or omissions of his employee, the
term "collateral" negligence is sometimes used to
describe negligence attributable to a contractor
employed by the principal and for which the latter
is not responsible, though he would be responsible
for the same thing if done by his servant. Weber
v. Railway Co., 20 App.Div. 292, 47 N.Y.S. 11.
Comparative Negligence, See Comparative Neg-
ligence.
Concurrent Negligence. Arises where the in-
jury is ,,..1.,proximatel;, caused by the concurrent
wrongful acts or omissions of two or more persons
acting independently. Carr v. St. Louis Auto Sup-
ply Co., 293 Mo. 562, 239 S.W. 827, 828.
Contributory Negligence. The act or omission
amounting to want of ordinary care on part of
complaining party, which, concurring with defend-
ant's negligence, is proximate cause of injury.
Honaker v. Crutchfield, 247 Ky. 495, 57 S.W.2d 502.
Any want of ordinary care on the part of the person in-
jured, (or on the part of another whose negligence is im-
putable to him,) which combined and concurred with the
defendant's negligence, and contributed to the injury as
a proximate cause thereof, and as an element without
which the injury would not have occurred. Railroad Co.
v. Young, 153 Ind. 163, 54 N.E. 791; Barton v. Railroad
Co., 52 Mo. 253, 14 Am.Rep. 418; McLaughlin v. Electric
Light Co., 100 Ky. 173, 37 S.W. 851, 34 L.R.A. 812; 25 C.J.
S. Damages; Townsend v. Missouri Pac. R. Co., 163 La.
872, 113 So. 130, 132, 54 A.L.R. 538.
The negligent act of plaintiff which, concurring and co-
operating with negligent act of defendant, becomes real,
efficient, and proximate cause of injury, or cause without
which the injury would not have occurred. Elder v. Plaza
Ry., 194 N.C. 617, 140 S.E. 298, 299; James v. Delaware,
L. & W. R. Co., 92 N.J.L. 149, 104 A. 328, 333.
"Assumption of risk" and "contributory negligence" are
not synonymous. Chicago, R. L & P. R. Co. v. Rogers, 60

Mutual Contributory Negligence. Exists when injury
would not have happened but for negligence of both par-
ties. Alexander v. Missouri, K. & T. R. Co. of Texas,
Tex.Civ.App., 287 S.W. 153, 155.
Criminal Negligence. Criminal negligence which
will render killing a person manslaughter is the
omission on the part of the person to do some act
which an ordinarily careful and prudent man
would do under like circumstances, or the doing of
some act which an ordinarily careful, prudent man
under like circumstances would not do by reason
of which another person is endangered in life or
mous with "reasonable" in this connection. State
v. Coulter, Mo.Sup., 204 S.W. 5.
Negligence of such a character, or occurring under such
circumstances, as to be punishable as a crime by statute;
or (at common law) such a flagrant and reckless disregard
of the safety of others, or wilful indifference to the injury
liable to follow, as to convert an act otherwise lawful into
a crime when it results in personal injury or death. 4 Bl.
Comm. 192, note; Cook v. Railroad Co., 72 Ga. 48; Rankin
v. Transportation Co., 73 Ga. 229, 54 Am.Rep. 874; Rail-
road Co. v. Chollette, 33 Neb. 143, 49 N.W. 1114.
Culpable Negligence. Failure to exercise that
degree of care rendered appropriate by the partic-
ular circumstances, and which a man of ordinary

perience would not have omitted. Carter v. Lum-
ber Co., 129 N.C. 203, 39 S.E. 828; Woodman v.

ball v. Palmer, C.C.A.Va., 25 C.C.A. 394, 80 F. 240.
Degrees of Negligence. There are degrees of
care, and failure to exercise proper degree of care
is "negligence," but there are no degrees of negli-
gence. Murray v. De Luxe Motor Stages of Illi-
nois, Mo.App., 133 S.W.2d 1074, 1078.
Classification of "negligence" as "gross," "ordinary,"
and "slight" indicates only that under special circum-
stances great care and caution, or ordinary care, or slight
care are required, but failure to exercise care demanded is
"negligence." 38 Del. Laws, c. 26. Gallegher v. Davis, 7
W.W.Harr. 380, 183 A. 620.
Gross Negligence, The Intentional failure to
perform a manifest duty in reckless disregard of
the consequences as affecting the life or property
of another; such a gross want of care and regard
for the rights of others as to justify the presump-
tion of willfulness and wantonness. Seelig v. First
Nat. Bank, D.C.I1L, 20 F.Supp. 61, 68.
The failure to exercise slight care. Jones v. Atchison,
T. & S. F. Ry. Co., 98 Kan. 133, 157 P. 399, 400; Burton
Const. Co. v. Metcalfe, 162 Ky. 366, 172 S.W. 698, 701.
The want of slight diligence. The want of that care
which every man of common sense, how inattentive so-
ever, takes of his own property. The omission of that care
which even inattentive and thoughtless men never fail to
take of their own property. Litchfield v. White, 7 N.Y.
442, 57 Am. Dec. 534; Seybel v. National Currency Bank,
54 N.Y. 299, 13 Am.Rep. 583; Briggs v. Spaulding, 141 U.
S. 132, 11 S.Ct. 925, 35 L.Ed. 662; The want of ordinary
diligence and care which usually prudent man takes of
his own property of like description. Dalton v. Hamilton
Hotel Operating Co., 242 N.Y. 481, 152 N.E. 268, 270. In
the law of torts (and especially with reference to personal
injury cases), the term means such negligence as evi-
dences a reckless disregard of human life, or of the safety
of persons exposed to its dangerous effects, or that entire
want of care which would raise the presumption of a con-
scious indifference to the rights of others which is equival-
ent to an intentional violation of them. McDonald v. Rail-
road Co., Tex.Civ.App., 21 S.W. 775; Railroad Co. v. Bode-
mer, 139 Ill. 596, 29 N.E. 692, 32 Am.St.Rep. 218; Coit v.
Western Union Tel. Co., 130 Cal. 657, 63 P. 83, 53 L.R.A.
678; Bremer v. Lake Erie & W. R. Co., 318 Ill. 11, 148 N.
E. 862, 866, 41 A.L.R. 1345.
Indifference to present legal duty and utter forgetfulness
of legal obligations, so far as other persons may be affect-
ed, and a manifestly smaller amount of watchfulness and
circumspection than the circumstances require of a person
of ordinary prudence. Burke v. Cook, 246 Mass. 518, 141
N.E. 585, 586. Negligence bordering on recklessness. Peo-
ple v. Adams, 289 Ill. 339, 124 N.E. 575, 577.
"Gross negligence," is substantially higher in magni-
twie than simple inadvertence, but falls short of inten-
tional wrong. Young v. City of Worcester, 253 Mass. 481,
alent to words "reckless and wanton." Jones v. Common-
wealth, 213 Ky. 356, 281 S. W. 164, 167.

less conduct as exposes one to very great danger
of injury or to imminent peril. Riggs v. Standard
Oil Co., C.C.Minn., 130 F. 204.
Legal Negligence. See Legal Negligence.

which a man of common prudence usually takes of
his own concerns. Ouderkirk v. Central Nat.
Bank, 119 N.Y. 263, 23 N.E. 875; Scott v. Depeyster,
1 Edw. Ch., N.Y., 543; Briggs v. Spaulding, 141 U.

ercise care of an ordinarily prudent person in same
situation. Avery v. Thompson, 117 Me. 120, 103
A. 4, 5, L.R.A. 1918D 205. A want of that care and
prudence that the great majority of mankind exer-
cise under the same or similar circumstances.
Clemens v. State, 176 Wis. 289, 185 N.W. 209, 212,
21 A.L.R. 1490. Wherever distinctions between
gross, ordinary and slight negligence are observed,
"ordinary negligence" is said to be the want of
ordinary care. Saxe v. Terry, 250 P. 27, 28, 140
Wash. 503.
"Ordinary negligence" is based on fact that one ought to
have known results of his acts, while "gross negligence"
rests on assumption that one knew results of his acts, but
was recklessly or wantonly indifferent to results. All neg-
ligence below that called gross by courts and text-book
writers is "slight negligence" and "ordinary negligence."
People v. Campbell, 237 Mich. 424, 212 N.W. 97, 99. The
distinction between "ordinary negligence" and "gross
negligence is that the former lies in the field of inad-
vertence and the latter in the field of actual or construc-
tive intent to injure. Ben tson v. Brown, 191 W is. 460,
211 N.W. 132, 133.
Passive Negligence. Negligence which permits
defects, obstacles or pitfalls to exist upon prem-
ises; which causes dangers arising from physical
condition of land itself. Perry v. St. Jean, 218 A.2d
484, 485; Cunag v. McCarthy, 191 N.E.2d 404, 407,
42 Ill.App.2d 36.
Slight Negligence. "A slight want of ordinary
care." 7 A. & E. Enc. Law 2d Ed. 373(2), 375(4),
377(5) ; Macon & Western R. Co. v. Davis, 13 Ga.
68(10). Slight negligence is not slight want of
ordinary care contributing to the injury, which
would defeat an action for negligence. Slight neg-
ligence is defined to be only an absence of that
degree of care and vigilance which persons of ex-
traordinary prudence and foresight are accus-
tomed to use. Briggs v. Spaulding, 141 U.S. 132,
11 &Ct. 924, 35 L.Ed. 662; Litchfield v. White, 7
N.Y. 438, 57 Am.Dec. 534.
Subsequent Negligence. Exists where defend-
ant sees plaintiff in a position of danger and fails
to exercise due and proper precaution to prevent
injury to plaintiff. Holman v. Brady, 241 Ala.
487, 3 So.2d 30, 33.
Wanton Negligence. Reckless indifference to
the consequences of an act or omission, where the
party acting or failing to act is conscious of his
conduct and, without any actual intent to injure, is
aware, from his knowledge of existing circum-
stances and conditions, that his conduct will in-
Alabama G. S. R. Co. v. Hall, 105 Ala. 599, 17 So.
Willful Negligence. Though rejected by some
courts and writers as involving a contradction of
terms, this phrase is occasionally used to describe
a higher or more aggravated form of negligence
than "gross." It then means a willful determina-
tion not to perform a known duty, or a reckless
disregard of the safety or the rights of others, as
manifested by the conscious and intentional omis-
sion of the care proper under the circumstances.
Victor Coal Co. v. Muir, 20 Colo. 320, 38 P. 378, 26
L.R.A. 435; Hoiwerson v. Railway Co., 157 Mo.
216, 57 S.W. 770, 50 L.R.A. 850.
Also, the failure to exercise ordinary care after dis-
covering a person to be in a position of peril. Cowan
v. Minneapolis, St. P. & S. S. M. Ry. Co., 42 N.D. 170, 172
N.W. 322, 323. It involves deliberation and malice.
Schwartz v. Johnson, 152 Tenn. 586, 280 S. W. 32, 33, 47
A.L.R. 323. "Willful negligence" implies an act intention-
ally done in disregard of another's rights, or omission to
do something to protect the rights of another after having
had such notice of those rights as would put a prudent
man on his guard to use ordinary care to avoid injury.
Covert v. Rockford & I. Ry. Co., 299 Ill. 288, 132 N.E. 504,
505. There is no proof of what is called "willful negli-
gence," unless it is shown that defendant discovered plain-
tiff's peril at such a time and under such circumstances
as offered an opportunity, and in consequence imposed a
duty on defendant, to take some step to prevent the injury.
It is the failure in such a duty that is willful negligence,
so called. Westerberg v. Motor Truck Service Co., 158
Minn. 202, 197 N.W. 98, 99. A charge of "willful and wan-
ton negligence" does not signify degrees of negligence, but
the words have reference to the intent, which must have
been to do the wrongful act, but not to inflict the result-
ing injury ; otherwise, it would be a willful and not a neg-
ligent injury. Westre v. Chicago, M. & St. P. Ry. Co.,
C.C.A.S.D., 2 F.2d 227, 229.

## NEGLIGENCE, ESTOPPEL BY

An estoppel
which occurs when one who is under a legal duty,
either to the person injured or to the public, to
act with due care, fails to do so, and such failure
is the natural and proximate cause of misleading
that person to alter his position. Bradford v. Ins.
Co., C.C.A.Pa., 102 F. 48, 43 C.C.A. 310, 49 L.R.A.
530; Central R. R. Co. of New Jersey v. McCart-
ney, 68 N.J.Law, 165, 52 Atl. 575; Brown & Co. v.
Ins. Co., 42 Md. 384, 20 Am.Rep. 90; 1 C. P. D.
578; 1905, 1 K. B. 677; Bigelow, Est. 6th Ed. 711.
An estoppel arises when one by acts, representa-
tions, intentionally or negligently, induces another
to change his position for the worse. Smith v.
Vara, 136 Misc. 500, 241 N.Y.S. 202, 209.
An estoppel arises when one by acts, representa-
tions, or admissions, or by silence when he ought
to speak, intentionally or through culpable negli-
gence, induces another to believe certain facts to
exist and such other rightfully relies and acts on
such belief so that he will be prejudiced if the for-
mer is permitted to deny the existence of such
facts. Postal v. Home State Bank for Savings,
284 Mich. 220, 279 N.W. 488, 491. American Ex-
change Nat. Bank v. Winder, 198 N.C. 18, 150 S.E.
489, 491.
Estoppel may exist where a party has led an-
other into the belief of a certain state of facts
by conduct of culpable negligence, calculated to
have that result, and the other party has acted
Nat. Bank, 343 Mo. 77, 119 S.W.2d 929, 938.
The phrase "estoppel by negligence" has been
characterized as "an expression usual but not ac-
curate, since negligence prevents a right of action
accruing, estoppel a right that has accrued from
being set up"; 2 Beven, Negl. 1332. See a discus-
sion of the doctrine, with critical examination of
the English cases, in 15 L. Q. R. 384.

## NEGLIGENCE IN LAW

"Actionable negligence"
or "negligence in law" grows out of nonobservance
of a duty prescribed by law. Kingery v. Donnell,
222 Iowa 241, 268 N.W. 617, 620.

## NEGLIGENCE PER SE

Conduct, whether of ac-
tion or omission, which may be declared and
treated as negligence without any argument or
proof as to the particular surrounding circum-
stances, either because it is in violation of a stat-
ute or valid municipal ordinance, or because it is
so palpably opposed to the dictates of common pru-
dence that it can be said without hesitation or
doubt that no careful person would have been
guilty of it. Missouri Pac. Ry. Co. v. Lee, 70 Tex.
496, 7 S.W. 857; Murray v. Missouri Pac. R. Co.,
101 Mo. 236, 13 S.W. 817, 20 Am.St.Rep. 601. As
a general rule, the violation of a public duty, en-
joined by law for the protection of person or prop-
erty, constitutes. Chicago, R. I. & P. Ry. Co. v.
Pitchford, 44 Okl. 197, 143 P. 1146, 1150; Kava-
nagh v. New York, 0. & W. Ry. Co., 196 App.Div.
384, 187 N.Y.S. 859, 860.

## NEGLIGENT

One is not "negligent" unless he
fails to exercise that degree of reasonable care
that would be exercised by person of ordinary pru-
dence under all the existing circumstances in view
of probable danger of injury. Pulford v. Mouw,
279 Mich. 376, 272 N.W. 713, 714.
Synonymous with "careless." Delmore v. Kansas City
Hardwood Flooring Co., 90 Kan. 29, 133 P. 151, 47 L.R.A.,
N.S., 1220. Sometimes regarded as synonymous with
"wrongful." Belmont v. City of New York, 191 App.Div.
717, 182 N.Y.S. 173, 175.
The word is often used to include all conduct which, al-
though not intended to invade any legally protected inter-
est, has the element of social fault. Universal Concrete
Pipe Co. v. Bassett, 130 Ohio St. 567, 200 N.E. 843, 847.

## NEGLIGENT ESCAPE

Where prisoner escapes
through officer's negligence. Hershey v. People,
91 Colo. 113, 12 P.2d 345, 347.
Where a party arrested or imprisoned escapes
against the will of him who arrests or imprisons
him, and is not freshly pursued and taken again
before he has been lost sight of. State v. Wedin,
85 N.J.L. 399, 89 A. 753, 754.

## NEGLIGENT OFFENSE

One which ensues from
a defective discharge of a duty, which defect could
have been avoided by the exercise of that care
which is usual, under similar circumstances, with
prudent persons of the same class. People v. Gay-
dica, 122 Misc.Rep. 31, 203 N.Y.S. 243, 258.

## NEGLIGENT VIOLATION OF STATUTE

One
occasioned by or accompanied with negligent con-
duct. Hamrick v. McCutcheon, 101 W.Va. 485, 133
S.E. 127, 128.
ness; inattention; the omission of proper care or
forethought. The term is not exactly equivalent
to our "negligence," inasmuch as it was not any
negligentia, but only a high or gross degree of it,
that amounted to culpa, (actionable or punishable
fault.)

## NEGLIGENTIA SEMPER HABET INFORTUN- IUM COMITEM

Negligence always has misfor-
tune for a companion. Co. Litt. 246b; Shep. Touch.

## NEGLIGENTLY

Without due caution and cir-
cumspection. People v. Pociask, 96 P.2d 788,
791, 14 Cal.2d 679.
The absence of ordinary care, which is such care as an
ordinarily prudent person would exercise for his own pro-
tection. Jones v. Commonwealth, 213 Ky. 356, 281 S.W.
164, 167. Equivalent of improperly. Cairnes v. Hillman
Drug Co., 214 Ala. 545, 108 So. 362, 364. "Inadvertently"
and "negligently" are synonymous. Meyerstein v. Burke,
193 Cal. 105, 222 P. 810.

## NEGLIGENTLY DONE

The doing of an act
where ordinary care required that it should not
have been done at all, or that it should have been
done in some other way, and where the doing of
the act was not consistent with the exercise of
ordinary care under the circumstances. Curtis v.
Mauger, 186 Ind. 118, 114 N.E. 408, 409.

## NEGOTIABILITY

In mercantile law, transfer-
able quality. That quality of bills of exchange
and promissory notes which renders them trans-

sessing which they are emphatically termed "nego-
tiable paper." 3 Kent, Comm. 74, 77, 89, et seq.
Story, Bills, § 60.

## NEGOTIABLE

Capable of being transferred by
indorsement or delivery so as to pass to holder the
right to sue in his own name and take free of
equities against assignor payee. Fischbach &
Moore v. Philadelphia Nat. Bank, 134 Pa.Super.
84, 3 A.2d 1011, 1012.
An instrument embodying an obligation for the payment
of money is called "negotiable" when the legal title to the
instrument itself and to the whole amount of money ex-
pressed upon its face, with the right to sue therefor in his
own name, may be transferred from one person to another
without a formal assignment, but by mere indorsement
and delivery by the holder or by delivery only. 1 Daniel,
Nego. Inst. § 1; Walker v. Ocean Bank, 19 Ind. 247; Rob-
inson v. Wilkinson, 38 Mich. 299.
Quasi Negotiable. "Quasi negotiable" describes the na-
ture of instruments which, while not negotiable, in sense
of law merchant, are so framed and dealt with as frequent-
ly to convey as good title to transferee as if they were
negotiable. A bill of lading is 'a quasi negotiable instru-
ment. National Bank of Savannah v. Kershaw Oil Mill,
C. C. A.S. C. , 202 F. 90, 94.

## NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS

Any written
securities which 'hay be transferred by indorse-
ment and delivery or by delivery merely, so as
to vest in the indorsee the legal title, and thus en-
able him to sue thereon in his own name. Or,
more technically, those instruments which not on-
ly carry the legal title with them by indorsement
or delivery, but carry as well, when transferred
before maturity, the right of the transferee to de-
mand the full amounts which their faces call for.
Daniel, Neg. Inst. § la.
A negotiable instrument is a written promise or request
for the payment of a certain sum of money to order or
bearer. Civ.Code Cal. § 3087.

236 P. 250, 254; Stevens v. Berkshire St. Ry. Co., 247 Mass.
399, 142 N.E. 59, 60; letters of credit, and other negotiable
written securities.
Under the Uniform Negotiable Instruments Act, an
instrument, to be negotiable, must be in writing and
signed; must contain an unconditional promise or order to
pay a certain sum of money on demand, or at a fixed and
determinable future time; it must be payable to order or
to bearer, and where it is addressed to the drawee, he must
be named or otherwise indicated with reasonable certainty;
its negotiability is not affected by the fact that it is not
dated, or that it bears a seal, or that it does not specify the
value given or that any value was given.

## NEGOTIABLE WORDS

NEGRO: The word "negro" means a black man,
one descended from the African race, and does not

more of African blood.
Term "Negro" means necessarily person of col-
or, but not every person of color is "negro." Rice

In the law of descent and dis-

nearest of kindred to the decedent, that is, those
who are most nearly related to him by blood; but
it is sometimes construed to mean only those who
are entitled to take under the statute of distribu-
tions, and sometimes to include other persons. 2
Story, Eq.Jur. § 1065b; Barrett v. Egbertson, 92 N.
J.Eq. 118, 111 A. 326, 327; Godfrey v. Epple, 100

stirpes or by representation. Slosson v. Lynch,
43 Barb., N.Y., 147.

## NEXT PRESENTATION

## NEXUM

Lat. In Roman law, in ancient times
the nexum seems to have been a species of for-
mal contract, involving a loan of money, and at-
tended with peculiar consequences, solemnized
with the "copper and balance." Later, it appears
to have been used as a general term for any con-
tract struck with those ceremonies, and hence to
have included the special form of conveyance
called "mancipatio." In a general sense it means
the obligation or bond between contracting par-
ties. Maine, Anc.Law, 305, et seq.; Hadl.Rom.
Law, 247.
In Roman law, this word expressed the tie or
obligation involved in the old conveyance by man-
cipatio ; and came latterly to be used interchange-
ably with (but less frequently than) the word "ob-
ligatio" itself. Brown.

## NICHILLS

In English practice, debts due to the
exchequer which the sheriff could not levy, and
as to which he returned nil. These sums were
transcribed once a year by the clerk of the ni-
chills, and sent to the treasurer's remembranc-
er's office, whence process was issued to recover
the "nichill" debts. Both of these offices were
abolished in 1833. Mozley & Whitley.

C. 350; State v. Perkins, 342 Mo. 560, 116 S.W.2d
80, 81, 82.
The rule is often followed that "nighttime" begins thirty
minutes after sunset and ends thirty minutes before sun-
rise. State v. Perkins, 342 Mo. 560, 116 S.W.2d 80, 82.
However, the limit of 9 p. m. to 6 a. m. has been fixed by
statute, in England, as the period of night, in prosecutions
for burglary and larceny. St. 24 & 25 Vict. c. 96, § 1;
Brown. In American law, the common-law definition is
still adhered to in some states, but in others "night" has
been defined by statute. U. S. v. Lepper, D.C.N.Y., 288 F.

walker is a prostitute who walks the streets at
night for the purpose of soliciting men for lewd
purposes. Stokes v. State, 92 Ala. 73, 9 So. 400, 25
Am.St.Rep. 22; People v. Berger, Gen.Sess., 169
N.Y.S. 319, 321.

## NIGRUM NUNQUAM EXCEDERE DEBET RU- BRUM

## NIHIL DICIT

the plaintiff's declaration or complaint within the time
limited. In some jurisdictions it is otherwise known as
judgment "for want of a plea." Gilder v. McIntyre, 29
Tex. 91; Falken v. Housatonic R. Co., 63 Conn. 258, 27 A.
1117; Wilbur v. Maynard, 6 Colo. 486.
Judgment taken against party who withdraws his answer
is judgment nihil dicit, which amounts to confession of
cause of action stated, and carries with it, more strongly
than judgment by default, admission of justice of plain-
tiff's case. Howe v. Central State Bank of Coleman, Tex.
Civ.App., 297 S.W. 692, 694.
NIHIL DICTUM QUOD NON DICTUM PRIUS.
Nothing is said which was not said before. Said
of a case where former arguments were repeated.
Hardr. 464.

## NIHIL EST

There is nothing. A form of return
made by a sheriff when he has been unable to
serve the writ.
"Although non est inventus is the more frequent return
In such a case, yet it is by no means as full in answer to
the command of the writ as is the return of nihil. That
amounts to an averment that the defendant has nothing in
the bailiwick, no dwelling-house, no family, no residence,
and no personal presence to enable the officer to make the
service required by the act of assembly. It is therefore a
full answer to the exigency of the writ." Sherer v. Easton
Bank, 33 Pa. 139.

## NIHIL EST ENIM LIBERALE QUOD NON IDEM JUSTUM

For there is nothing generous which is
not at the same time just. 2 Kent, Comm. 441,

## NISI

Lat. Unless.
The word is often affixed, as a kind of elliptical expres-
sion, to the words "rule," "order," "decree," "judgment,"
or "confirmation," to indicate that the adjudication spoken
of is one which is to stand as valid and operative unless the
party affected by it shall appear and show cause against it,
or take some other appropriate step to avoid it or procure
its revocation. Thus a "decree nisi" is one which will defi-
nitely conclude the defendant's rights unless, within the
prescribed time, he shows cause to set it aside or success-
fully appeals. The word, in this sense, is opposed to
"absolute." And when a rule nisi is finally confirmed, for
the defendant's failure to show cause against it, it is said
to be "made absolute."
NISI FECERIS. The name of a clause commonly
occurring in the old manorial writs, commanding
that, if the lords failed to do justice, the king's

after verdict and before judgment, where it appeared that
defendant's plea confessed the cause of action and set up
matters in avoidance which, although verified by the ver-
dict, were insufficient to constitute a defense or bar to the
action. But either by statutory enactment or because of
relaxation of the early common-law rule, the generally pre-
vailing rule now is that either plaintiff or defendant may
have a judgment non obstante veredicto in proper cases.
49 C.J.S.Judgments § 60.
Judgment non obstante veredicto in its broadest sense is
a judgment rendered in favor of one party notwithstand-

in such a manner as to infringe upon the rights and privi-

## NOTICE

Information; the result of observation,
whether by the senses or the mind; knowledge of
the existence of a fact or state of affairs; the
means of knowledge. Abercrombie v. Virginia-
Carolina Chemical Co., 206 Ala. 615, 91 So. 311, 312;
Knights and Ladies of Security v. Bell, 93 Old. 272,
220 P. 594, 597.
Knowledge of facts which would naturally lead an honest
and prudent person to make inquiry constitutes "notice"
of everything which such inquiry pursued in good faith
would disclose. Twitchell v. Nelson, 131 Minn. 375, 155
N.W. 621, 624 ; German-American Nat. Bank of Lincoln v.
Martin, 277 Ill. 629, 115 N.E. 721, 729.
In another sense, "notice" means information, an advice,
or written warning, in more or less formal shape, intended
to apprise a person of some proceeding in which his inter-
ests are involved, or informing him of some fact which it
is his right to know and the duty of the notifying party to
communicate.
Under the Negotiable Instrument Law "notice" of infir-
mity of instrument is actual knowledge or knowledge of
such facts that taking note amounts to bad faith. Glendo
State Bank v. Abbott, 30 Wyo. 98, 216 P. 700, 702, 34 A.L.R.
Notice is either (1) statutory, e. made so by legisla-
tive enactment; (2) actual, which brings the knowledge of
a fact directly home to the party; or (3) constructive.
Constructive notice may be subdivided into : (a) Where
there exists actual notice of matter, to which equity has
added constructive notice of facts, which an inquiry after
such matter would have elicited; and (b) where there has
been a designed abstinence from inquiry for the very pur-
pose of escaping notice. Wharton.
Actual notice has been defined as notice expressly and
actually given, and brought home to the party directly.
Jordan v. Pollock, 14 Ga. 145; McCray v. Clar, 82 Pa. 457:
Morey v. Milliken, 86 Me. 464, 30 A. 102. The term "actual
notice," however, is generally given a wider meaning as
embracing two classes, express and implied; the former
includes all knowledge of a degree above that which
depends upon collateral inference, or which imposes upon
the party the further duty of inquiry; the latter imputes
knowledge to the party because he is shown to be conscious
of having the means of knowledge. In this sense actual
notice is such notice as is positively proved to have been
given to a party directly and personally, or such as he is
presumed to have received personally because the evidence
within his knowledge was sufficient to put him upon in-
quiry. Picklesimer v. Smith, 164 Ga. 600, 139 S.E. 72, 74;
White v. Fisher, 77 Ind. 65, 40 Am.Rep. 287.
Constructive notice is information or knowledge of a fact
imputed by law to a person, (although he may not actually
have it), because he could have discovered the fact by prop-
er diligence, and his situation was such as to cast upon him
the duty of inquiring into it. Baltimore v. Whittington, 78
Md. 231, 27 A. 984; Acer v. Westcott, 46 N.Y. 384, 7 Am.
Rep. 355.
Notice is also further classified as express or implied.
Express notice embraces not only knowledge, but also that
which is communicated by direct information, either writ-
ten or oral, from those who are cognizant of the fact com-
municated. Baltimore v. Whittington, 78 Md.• 231, 27 A.
984. Implied notice is one of the varieties of actual notice
(not constructive) and is distinguished from "express"
actual notice. It is notice inferred or imputed to a party
by reason of his knowledge of facts or circumstances col-
lateral to the main fact, of such a character as to put him
upon inquiry, and which, if the inquiry were followed up
with due diligence, would lead him definitely to the knowl-
edge of the main fact. Rhodes v. Outcalt, 48 Mo. 370;
Baltimore v. Whittington, 78 Md. 231, 27 A. 984; Wells v.
"Constructive notice" is a presumption of law, making it
impossible for one to deny the matter concerning which
notice is given, while "implied notice" is a presumption of
fact, relating to what one can learn by reasonable inquiry,
and arises from actual notice of circumstances, and not
from constructive notice. Charles v. Roxana Petroleum
Corporation, C.C.A.Okl., 282 F. 983, 988. Or as otherwise
defined, implied notice may be said to exist where_ the fact
in question lies open to the knowledge of the party, so that
the exercise of reasonable observation and watchfulness
would not fail to apprise him of it, although no one has
told him of it in so many words. See City of Philadelphia
v. Smith, Pa., 16 A. 493.
Averment of Notice. The statement in a plead-
ing that notice has been given.
Immediate Notice. Under an insurance policy,
notice of loss within reasonable time under circum-
stances of case. National Surety Co. v. Western
Pac. Ry. Co., Cal., 119 C.C.A. 91, 200 F. 675, 687;
Southern States Fire Ins. Co. v. Hand-Jordan Co.,
112 Miss. 565, 73 So. 578, 579.
Judicial Notice. See Judicial Notice.
Legal Notice. See Legal Notice.
Personal Notice. Communication of notice
orally or in writing (according to the circum-
stances) directly to the person affected or to be
charged, as distinguished from constructive or im-
plied notice, and also from notice imputed to him
because given to his agent or representative. Loeb
v. Huddleston, 105 Ala. 257, 16 So. 714; Pearson v.
Lovejoy, 53 Barb., N.Y., 407.
Presumptive Notice. Implied actual notice.
The difference between "presumptive" and "con-
structive" notice is that the former is an inference
of fact which is capable of being explained or con-
tradicted, while the latter is a conclusion of law
which cannot be contradicted. Brown v. Baldwin,
121 Mo. 106, 25 S.W. 858; Brush v. Ware, 15 Pet.
98, 10 L.Ed. 672.
Public Notice. Notice given to the public
generally, or to the entire community, or to all
whom it may concern. Pennsylvania Training
School v. Independent Mut. F. Ins. Co., 127 Pa.
559, 18 A. 392.
Reasonable Notice. Such notice or informa-
tion of a fact as may fairly and properly be ex-
pected or required in the particular circumstances.
Sterling Mfg. Co. v. Hough, 49 Neb. 618, 68 N.W.
1019; Mallory v. Leiby, 1 Kan. 102.

## NOTICE IN LIEU OF SERVICE

In lieu of per-
sonally serving a writ of summons (or other legal
process,) in English practice, the court occasion-
ally allows the plaintiff (or other party) to give
notice in lieu of service, such notice being such as
will in all probability reach the party. This notice
is peculiarly appropriate in the case of a foreigner
out of the jurisdiction, whom it is desired to serve
with a writ of summons. Sweet.

## NOTICE OF ACTION

certain particular individuals, as in the case of ac-
tions against justices of the peace, it is necessary

ing, entitled in a cause, stating that, on a certain
day designated, a motion will be made to the court

20 Johns., N.Y., 140.

See Protest.

## NOTICE OF TRIAL

A notice given by one of the
parties in an action to the other, after an issue
has been reached, that he intends to bring the
cause forward for trial at the next term of the
court.

## NOTICE TO ADMIT

In the practice of the Eng-
lish high court, either party to an action may call
on the other party by notice to admit the existence
and execution of any document, in order to save
the expense of proving it at the trial; and the
party refusing to admit must bear the costs of
proving it unless the judge certifies that the re-
fusal to admit was reasonable. Rules of Court,
xxxii. 2; Sweet.

## NOTICE TO PLEAD

This is a notice which, in
the practice of some states, is prerequisite to the
taking judgment by default. It proceeds from the
plaintiff, and warns the defendant that he must
plead to the declaration or complaint within a pre-
scribed time.

## NOTICE TO PRODUCE

In practice, a notice in
writing, given in an action at law, requiring the
opposite party to produce a certain described paper
or document at the trial. Chit.Archb.Pr. 230; 3
Chit.Gen.Pr. 834.

## NOTICE TO QUIT

A written notice given by a
landlord to his tenant, stating that the former de-
sires to repossess himself of the demised premises,
and that the latter is required to quit and remove
from the same at a time designated, either at the
expiration of the term, if the tenant is in under a
lease, or immediately, if the tenancy is at will or by
sufferance. The term is also sometimes applied
to a written notice given by the tenant to the land-
lord, to the effect that he intends to quit the de-
mised premises and deliver possession of the same
on a day named. Garner v. Hannah, 6 Duer, N.Y.,
270; Oakes v. Munroe, 8 Cush., Mass., 287.

## NOTIFY

To give notice to; to inform by words
or writing, in person or by message, or by any
"notify" one of a fact is to make it known to him;
to inform him by notice. Fast v. Scruggs, 164
Oki. 196, 23 P.2d 383.
In legal proceedings, and In respect to public matters,
this word is generally, if not universally, used as import-
ing a notice given by some person, whose duty it was to
give it, in some manner prescribed, and to some person
entitled to receive it, or be notified. Appeal of Potwine, 31
Conn. 384; Home Benefit Ass'n of Angelina County v. Jor-
dan, Tex.Civ.App., 191 S.W. 725, 728.

ligence; notice.

## NOTITIA DICITUR A NOSCENDO; ET NOTI- TIA NON DEBET CLAUDICARE

## NOTORIOUS

well or widely known, forming a part of common
knowledge, or universally recognized. Mathis v.
State, 60 Okl.Cr. 58, 61 P.2d 261, 267. Open;
generally or commonly known and spoken of.
McNeill v. McNeill, 166 Iowa, 680, 148 N.W. 643,

S.W. 832, 835, Ann.Cas.1914D, 238.
In the law of evidence, matters deemed notorious do not
require to be proved. There does not seem to be any rec-
ognized rule as to what matters are deemed notorious.
Cases have occurred in which the state of society or public
feeling has been treated as notorious; e. g., during times
of sedition. Best, Ev. 354; Sweet.

## NOVA CONSTITUTIO FUTURIS FORMAM IM- PONERE DEBET NON PRIETERITIS

state of the law ought to affect the future, not the
past. 2 Inst. 292; Broom, Max. 34, 37.

## NOVIE NARRATIONES

New counts. The col-
lection called "Novas Narrationes" contains plead-
ings in actions during the reign of Edward III.
It consists principally of declarations, as the title
imports; but there are sometimes pleas and sub-
sequent pleadings. The Articuli ad Novas Narra-
tiones is usually subjoined to this little book, and
is a small treatise on the method of pleading. It
first treats of actions and courts, and then goes
through each particular writ, and the declaration
upon it, accompanied with directions, and illus-
trated by precedents. 3 Reeve, Eng. Law, 152;
Wharton.

## NOVALE

Land newly plowed and converted in-
to tillage, and which has not been tilled before

## NOVATION

Substitution of new contract be-
tween same or different parties. Alexander v.
Manza, 22 N.J.Misc. 88, 36 A.2d 142, 148. The sub-
stitution of a new debt or obligation for an exist-
ing one. Hard v. Burton, 62 Vt. 314, 20 A. 269;
McCartney v. Kipp, 171 Pa. 644, 33 A. 233. The
substitution by mutual agreement of one debtor
for another or of one creditor for another, where-
by the old debt is extinguished. Pierce Fordyce
Oil Ass'n v. Woods, Tex.Civ.App., 180 S.W. 1181,
1183; Peters v. Poro's Estate, 96 Vt. 95, 117 A. 244,
249, 25 A.L.R. 615.
The requisites of a "novation" are a previous valid obli-
gation, an agreement of all the parties to a new contract,
the extinguishment of the old obligation, and the validity
of the new one. Alkire v. Acuff, 134 Okl. 43, 272 P. 405,
406; Tulsa Ice Co. v. Liley, 157 Okl. 86, 10 P.2d 1090, 1091;

337, 342, 50 L.R.A.,N.S., 453.
The term was originally a technical term of the
civil law, but is now in very general use in Eng-
lish and American jurisprudence.
In the civil law, there are three kinds of nova-
tion: Where the debtor and creditor remain the
same, but a new debt takes the place of the old
one; where the debt remains the same, but a new
debtor is substituted; where the debt and debtor
remain, but a new creditor is substituted. Wheel-
er v. Wardell, 173 Va. 168, 3 S.E.2d 377, 380.

NOVELLIE (or NOVELLZE CONSTITUTIONES.)
New constitutions; generally translated in Eng-
lish, "Novels." The Latin name of those constitu-
tions which were issued by Justinian after the
publication of his Code; most of them being
originally written in Greek. After his death, a
collection of 168 Novels was made, 154 of which
had been issued by Justinian, and the rest by his
successors. These were afterwards included in
the Corpus Juris Civilis, (q. v.,) and now consti-
tute one of its four principal divisions. Mackeld.
Rom. Law, § 80; 1 Kent, Comm. 541.

## NOVELLIE LEONIS

The ordinances of the Em-
peror Leo, which were made from the year 887
till the year 893, are so called. These Novels
changed many rules of the Justinian law. This
collection contains 113 Novels, written originally
in Greek, and afterwards, in 1560, translated into
Latin by Agilteus. Mackeld. Rom. Law, § 84.

## NOVELS

Constitutions (Novellce Constitutiones) of Justin-
ian and his successors, now forming a part of the
Corpus Juris Civilis. See NovellEe.

## NOVELTY

In order that there may be "novelty"
so as to sustain a patent, the thing must not have
been known to any one before, mere novelty of
form being insufficient. Seaver v. Wm. Filene's
Sons Co., D.C.Mass., 37 F.Supp. 762, 765. An ob-
jection to a patent or claim for a patent on the
ground that the invention is not new or original

of, or protest against, a new work.
This was a species of remedy in the civil law, available
to a person who thought his rights or his property were
threatened with injury by the act of his neighbor in erect-
ing or demolishing any structure, which was called a "new
work." In such case, he might go upon the ground, while
the work was in progress, and publicly protest against or
forbid its completion, in the presence of the workmen or of
the owner or his representative.

## NOVIGILD

## NOVITER PERVENTA, or NOVITER AD NO- TITIAM PERVENTA

In ecclesiastical procedure,
facts "newly come" to the knowledge of a party
to a cause. Leave to plead facts noviter perventa
is generally given, in a proper case, even after the
pleadings are closed. Phillim. Ecc. Law, 1257;
Rog. Ecc. Law, 723.

## NOVODAMUS

In old Scotch law, we give anew.
The name given to a charter, or clause in a char-

NOVUM JUDICIUM NON DAT NOVUM JUS, SED
DECLARAT ANTIQUUM; QUIA JUDICIUM EST
JURIS DICTUM ET PER JUDICIUM JUS EST
NOVITER REVELATUM QUOD DIU FUIT VE-
LATUM. A new adjudication does not make a
new law, but declares the old; because adjudica-
tion is the utterance of the law, and by adjudica-
tion the law is newly revealed which was for a
long time hidden. 10 Coke, 42.

## NOVUM OPUS

Lat. In the civil law, a new
work. See Novi Operis Nunciatio.

## NOVUS HOMO

bert v. Rosenberger, C.C.A.Mo., 204 F. 934, 935;
Walker v. Dwelle, 187 Iowa, 1384, 175 N.W. 957,
"Now" as used in a statute ordinarily refers
to the date of its taking effect, but the word is
sometimes used, not with reference to the moment
of speaking but to a time contemporaneous with
something done, and may mean at the time spoken
of or referred to as well as at the time of speaking.
State v. City of St. Lawrence, 101 Kan. 225, 165
P. 826.
Word "now" used in will refers to time of testa-
tor's death, Tate v. Tate, 160 Ga. 449, 128 S.E. 393,
395; but, in light of context, may apply to date of
will, Merrill v. Winchester, 120 Me. 203, 113 A.
261, 264.

## NOXA

Lat. In the civil law, any damage or
injury done to persons or property by an unlaw-
ful act committed by a man's slave or animal.
An action for damages lay against the master or
owner, who, however, might escape further re-

to the party injured. "Noxa" was also used as the
designation of the offense committed, and of its
punishment, and sometimes of the slave or animal
doing the damage.

fully obstructs the free passage or use, in the cus-
tomary manner, of any navigable lake or river,
bay, stream, canal, or basin, or any public park,
square, street, or highway, is a nuisance. Civ.
Code Cal. § 3479; Veazie v. Dwinel, 50 Me. 479;
Bohan v. Port Jervis Gaslight Co., 122 N.Y. 18, 25
N.E. 246, 9 L.R.A. 711; Baltimore & P. R. Co. v.
Fifth Baptist Church, 137 U.S. 568, 11 S.Ct. 185,

In determining what constitutes a "nuisance," the ques-
tion is whether the nuisance will or does produce such a
condition of things as in the judgment of reasonable men
is naturally productive of actual physical discomfort to
persons of ordinary sensibility and ordinary tastes and
habits. Meeks v. Wood, 66 Ind.App. 594, 118 N.E. 591, 592.
Nuisances are commonly classed as public and private,
and mixed. A public nuisance is one which affects an
indefinite number of persons, or all the residents of a par-
ticular locality, or all people coming within the extent of
its range or operation, although the extent of the annoy-
ance or damage inflicted upon individuals may be unequal.
Burnham v. Hotchkiss, 14 Conn. 317; Chesbrough v.
Com'rs, 37 Ohio St. 508; Lansing v. Smith, 4 Wend., N.Y.,
30, 21 Am.Dec. 89. A private nuisance was originally
defined as anything done to the hurt or annoyance of the
lands, tenements, or hereditaments of another. 3 Bl.
Comm. 216; Whittemore v. Baxter Laundry Co. 181 Mich.
564, 148 N.W. 437, 52 L.R.A.,N.S., 930, Ann.Cas.1916C, 818.
As distinguished from public nuisance, it includes any
wrongful act which destroys or deteriorates the property
of an individual or of a few persons or interferes with
their lawful use or enjoyment thereof, or any act which
unlawfully hinders them in the enjoyment of a common or
public right and causes them a special injury different
from that sustained by the general public. Therefore,
although the ground of distinction between public and pri-
vate nuisances is still the injury to the community at large
or, on the other hand, to a single individual, it is evident
that the same thing or act may constitute a public nui-
sance and at the same time a private nuisance. Heeg v.
Licht, 80 N.Y. 582, 36 Am.Rep. 654; Baltzeger v. Carolina
Midland R. Co., 54 S.C. 242, 32 S.E. 358, 71 Am.St.Rep.
789; Willcox v. Hines, 100 Tenn. 538, 46 S.W. 297, 41
L.R.A. 278; Harris v. Poulton, 99 W.Va. 20, 127 S.E. 647,
650, 651, 40 A.L.R. 334. A mixed nuisance is of the kind
last described; that is, it is one which is both public and
private in its effects,-public because it injures many per-
sons or all the community, and private in that it also pro-
duces special injuries to private rights. Kelley v. New
York, 27 N.Y.S. 164, 6 Misc. 516.
Abatement of a nuisance. The removal, pros-
tration, or destruction of that which causes a nui-
sance, whether by breaking or pulling it down, or
otherwise removing, disintegrating, or effacing
it. Ruff v. Phillips, 50 Ga. 130.
The remedy which the law allows a party injured by a
nuisance of destroying or removing it by his own act, so as
he commits no riot in doing it, nor occasions (in the case
of a private nuisance) any damage beyond what the re-
moval of the inconvenience necessarily requires. 3 Bl.
Comm. 5, 168; 3 Steph.Comm. 361; 2 Salk. 458.
Actionable nuisance. See Actionable.
Assize of nuisance. In old practice, this was
a judicial writ directed to the sheriff of the county
in which a nuisance existed, in which it was stated
ticular fact done ad nocumentum liberi tenementi
sui, (to the nuisance of his freehold,) and com-
manding the sheriff to summon an assize (that
is, a jury) to view the premises, and have them
at the next commission of assizes, that justice
might be done, etc. 3 Bl.Comm. 221.
Common nuisance. One which affects the public
in general, and not merely some particular per-
son; a public nuisance. 1 Hawk.P.C. 197; State
v. Rodgers, 91 N.J.L. 212, 102 A. 433, 434.
Continuing nuisance. An uninterrupted or per-
iodically recurring nuisance; not necessarily a
constant or unceasing injury, but a nuisance which
occurs so often and is so necessarily an incident
of the use of property complained of that it can
fairly be said to be continuous. Farley v. Gas-
light Co., 105 Ga. 323, 31 S.E. 193; Kafka v. Bozio,
191 Cal. 746, 218 P. 753, 755, 29 A.L.R. 833.
Permanent nuisance. A nuisance of such a
character that its continuance is necessarily an
injury which will continue without change. Nor-
folk & W. Ry. Co. v. Allen, 118 Va. 428, 87 S.E. 558,
560. One that cannot be readily abated at small
expense. Cumberland Torpedo Co. v. Gaines, 201
Ky. 88, 255 S.W. 1046, 1048
NUISANCE AT LAW. Nuisance per se (q. v.).

## NUISANCE IN FACT

Acts, occupations or struc-
tures which are not nuisances per se but may be-
come nuisances by reason of the circumstances
or the location and surroundings. Asphalt Pro-
ducts Co. v. Marable, 65 Ga.App. 877, 16 S.E.2d 771,
NUISANCE PER ACCIDENS. Nuisances in fact
(q. v.).

## NUISANCE PER SE

An act, occupation, or struc-
ture which is a nuisance at all times and under all
circumstances, regardless of location or surround-
ings. Kays v. City of Versailles, 224 Mo.App. 178,
22 S.W.2d 182, 183. As, things prejudicial to pub-
lic morals or dangerous to life or injurious to pub-
lic rights; distinguished from things declared to
be nuisances by statute, and also from things
which constitute nuisances only when considered
with reference to their particular location or other
individual circumstances. Hundley v. Harrison,
123 Ala. 292, 26 So. 294; Whitmore v. Paper Co.,
91 Me. 297, 39 A. 1032, 40 L.R.A. 377; Simpson v.
Du Pont Powder Co., 143 Ga. 465, 85 SP.E. 344, 345,

Judgment of nul tiel record occurs when some
pleading denies the existence of a record and issue
is joined thereon; the record being produced is

words "null and void," when used in a contract or

## NULLITY

Nothing; no proceeding; an act or

may treat as though it had not taken place, or

ter v. Hilgen, 40 Wis. 363; Jenness v. Lapeer Coun-
ty Circuit Judge, 42 Mich. 469, 4 N.W. 220.
Absolute Nullity. In Spanish law, nullity is either abso-
lute or relative. The former is that which arises from the
law, whether civil or criminal, the principal motive for
which is the public interest, while the latter is that which
affects one certain individual. Sunol v. Hepburn, 1 Cal.
281. No such distinction, however, is recognized in Amer-
ican law, and the term "absolute nullity" is used more for
emphasis than as indicating a degree of invalidity. As to
the ratification or subsequent validation of "absolute nul-
lities," see Means v. Robinson, 7 Tex. 502, 516.

## NULLITY OF MARRIAGE

The entire invalidity
of a supposed, pretended, or attempted marriage,

ties or other diriment impediments. An action
seeking a decree declaring such an assumed mar-
riage to be null and void is called a suit of "null-
ity of marriage." It differs from an action for di-
vorce, because the latter supposes the existence of
a valid and lawful marriage. 2 Bish. Mar. & Div.
§§ 289-294.

## NULLIUS FILIUS

spect of inheritance. State v. Chavez, 42 N.M.
569, 82 P.2d 900, 902.
