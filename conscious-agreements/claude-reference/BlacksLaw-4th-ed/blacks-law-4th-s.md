did not enter himself a crusader was obliged to
pay a tenth of his yearly revenue and of the value
of all his movables, except his wearing apparel,
books, and arms. The Carthusians, Bernardines,
Gibbon remarks that when the necessity for this
tax no longer existed, the church still clung to it
as too lucrative to be abandoned, and thus arose
the tithing of ecclesiastical benefices for the pope
or other sovereigns. Enc.Lond.

196, 122 N.E. 283, 284; Faulkner v. Town of South

a price in current money, and the other gives

circumstances concur to the perfection of the con-
tract, to-wit, the thing sold, the price, and the
consent. Civ.Code La. art. 2439.
To constitute a "sale," there must be parties standing
to each other in the relation of buyer and seller, their
minds must assent to the same proposition, and a consider.
ation must pass. Commissioner of Internal Revenue v.
Freihofer, C.C.A.3, 102 F.2d 787, 789, 790, 125 A.L.R. 761.
First, contract of sale which is completed when offer is
made and accepted and, second, delivery of property which
may precede, be accompanied by, or follow, payment of
price as may have been agreed on between parties. Inland
Refining Co. v. Langworthy, 112 Okl. 280, 240 P. 627, 629.
An essential element of a "sale" is the money price
which must either be fixed by agreement or capable oT
being ascertained therefrom. Puryear-Meyer Grocer Co.
v. Cardwell Bank, Mo.App., 4 S.W.2d 489, 490.
"Sale," as applied to relation between landowner
and real estate broker working to secure purchas-
er of land, means procuring purchaser able, ready
and willing to buy on terms fixed by seller. T. W.
Sandford & Co. v. Waring, 201 Ky. 169, 256 S.W. 9,
Synonyms
The contract of "sale" is distinguished from
"barter" (which applies only to goods) and "ex-
change," (which is used of both land and goods,)
in that both the latter terms denote a commuta-
tion of property for property; i. e., the price or
consideration is always paid in money if the trans-
action is a sale, but, if it is a barter or exchange,
it is paid in specific property susceptible of valu-
ation. Westfall v. Ellis, 141 Minn. 377, 170 N.W.
339, 341; J. I. Case Threshing Mach. Co. v. Loom-
is, 31 N.D. 27, 153 N.W. 479, 481. "Sale" differs
from "gift" in that the latter transaction involves
no return or recompense for the thing transfer-
red. But an onerous gift sometimes approaches
the nature of a sale, at least where the charge it
imposes is a payment of money. "Sale" is also
to be discriminated from "bailment;" and the dif-
ference is to be found in the fact that the contract
of bailment always contemplates the return to
the bailor of the specific article delivered, either
in its original form or in a modified or altered
form, or the return of an article which, though
not identical, is of the same class, and is equiv-
alent. But sale never involves the return of the
article itself, but only a consideration in money.
This contract differs also from "accord and satis-
faction;" because in the latter the object of trans-
ferring the property is to compromise and settle a
claim, while the object of a sale is the price given.
The cardinal difference between the relation of
seller and buyer and that of principal and factor
is that in a "sale" title passes to the buyer, while
in a "consignment" by principal to factor title
remains in principal, and only possession passes
to factor. McGaw v. Hanway, 120 Md. 197, 87 A.
666, 667, Ann.Cas.1915A, 601, and a "sale" is dis-
tinguished from a mortgage, in that the former is
a transfer of the absolute property in the goods
for a price, whereas a mortgage is at most a con-
ditional sale of property as security for the pay-
ment of a debt or performance of some other ob-
ligation, subject to the condition that on perform-
ance title shall revest in the mortgagor. Waldrep
v. Exchange State Bank of Keifer, 81 Okl. 162, 197
P. 509, 511, 14 A.L.R. 747.
An abandonment must be made without any
desire that any other person shall acquire the
thing abandoned, since if it is made for a consid-
eration it is a "sale" or "barter," and if made
without consideration, but with an intention that
some other person shall become the possessor, it
1014, 27 Cal.App.2d 668.
General
Absolute and conditional sales. An absolute
sale is one where the property in chattels passes
to the buyer upon the completion of the bargain.
Truax v. Parvis, 7 Houst. (Del.) 330, 32 A. 227.
A conditional sale is one in which the transfer of
title is made to depend on the performance of a
condition, usually the payment of the price; it is
a purchase for a price paid or to be paid, to be-
come absolute on a particular event, or a purchase
accompanied by an agreement to resell upon par-
ticular terms. Poindexter v. McCannon, 16 N.C.
373, 18 Am.Dec. 591; Crimp v. McCormick Const.
Co., Ill., 18 C.C.A. 595, 72 F. 366.
Conditional sales are distinguishable from mortgages in
that a mortgage assumes the continued existence of a
debt and is given as security therefor. Turner v. Kerr, 44
Mo. 429; Crane v. Bonnell, 2 N.J.Eq. 264; Weathersly v.
Weathersly, 40 Miss. 462, 90 Am.Dec. 344; Lamborn v.
Denison State Bank, 115 Kan. 415, 223 P. 293, 294.

v. Hyman Levin Co., Sup., 172 N.Y.S. 437, 438. A
sale where title is not to pass until the price is
paid, or where title has passed, but possession is
not to be delivered until payment is made. E. L.
Welch Co. v. Lahart Elevator Co., 122 Minn. 432,
142 N.W. 828, 830.
Exclusive sale. With respect to a broker. An
agreement by the owner that he will not sell the
property during the life of the contract to any
purchaser not procured by the broker in question.
Harris v. McPherson, 97 Conn. 164, 115 A. 723, 724,
24 A.L.R. 1530, but see contra Roberts v. Har-
rington, 168 Wis. 217, 169 N.W. 603, 10 A.L.R. 810.
Executed and executory sales. An executed
sale is one which is final and complete in all its
particulars and details, nothing remaining to be
done by either party to effect an absolute transfer
of the subject-matter of the sale. Fogel v. Bru-
baker, 15 A. 692, 122 Pa. 7; Martin v. John Clay &
Co., Mo.App., 167 S.W.2d 407, 411. An executory
sale is one which has been definitely agreed on as
to terms and conditions, but which has not yet
been carried into full effect in respect to some of
its terms or details, as where it remains to deter-

## SALIC LAW

A body of law framed by the Salian
Franks, a Teutonic race who settled in Gaul about
the beginning of the fifth century.
It is the most ancient of the barbarian Codes. It is said
to have been compiled about the year 420. It embraced the
laws and customs of the Salian Franks. It is of great
historical value, in connection with the origins of feudal-
was one which excluded women from the inheritance of
landed estates, by an extension of which law females were
always excluded from succession to the crown of France.
Hence this provision, by itself, is often referred to as the
"Salic Law."

quently applied to that fundamental law of France
which excluded females from succession to the
crown. Supposed to have been derived from the
sixty-second title of the Salic Law, "De Alode."

## SALVAGE

In maritime law. A compensation
allowed to persons by whose assistance a ship or
its cargo has been saved, in whole or in part,
from impending danger, or recovered from actual
loss, in cases of shipwreck, derelict, or recapture.
3 Kent, Comm. 245; Cope v. Vallette Dry-Dock
Co., 7 S.Ct. 336, 119 U.S. 625, 30 L.Ed. 501; J. M.
Guffey Petroleum Co. v. Borison, C.C.A.Tex., 211
F. 594, 601.
Elements necessary to valid "salvage" are marine peril,
with service voluntarily rendered, when not required as
existing duty, or from a special contract, and success in
whole or in part, and that service rendered contributed to
such success. Robert R. Sizer & Co. v. Chiarello Bros., D.
C.N.Y., 32 F.2d 333, 335.
In the older books of the law, (and sometimes in
modern writings,) the term is also used to denote
the goods or property saved.
Equitable Salvage
By analogy, the term "salvage" is sometimes
also used in cases which have nothing to do with
maritime perils, but in which property has been
preserved from loss by the last of several ad-
vances by different persons. In such a case, the
.person making the last advance is frequently en-
titled to priority over the others, on the ground
that, without his advance, the property would have
been lost altogether. This right, which is some-
times called that of "equitable salvage," and is in
the nature of a lien, is chiefly of importance with
reference to payments made to prevent leases or
policies of insurance from being forfeited, or to
prevent mines and similar undertakings from be-
ing stopped or injured. 1 Fish.Mortg. 149; 3 Ch.
Div. 411; L.R. 14 Eq. 4; 7 Ch.Div. 825.
Salvage Charges
This term includes all the expenses and costs
incurred in the work of saving and preserving the
property which was in danger. The salvage
charges ultimately fall upon the insurers.
Salvage Loss
That kind of loss which it is presumed would,
but for certain services rendered and exertions
made, have become a total loss. In the language
of marine underwriters, this term means the dif-
ference between the amount of salvage, after
deducting the charges, and the original value of
the property insured. Koons v. La Fonciere Corn-
pagnie, D.C.Cal., 71 F. 981.
Salvage Service
A service voluntarily rendered to a vessel in
need of assistance, and is designed to relieve her
reasonably apprehended and for which a salvage
reward is allowed by the maritime law. The
Emanuel Stavroudis, D.C.Md., 23 F.2d 214, 216.
It is distinguished from "towage service," in that the
latter is rendered for the mere purpose of expediting a
vessel's voyage, without reference to any circumstances of
danger, though the service in each case may be rendered in
the same way. The Emanuel Stavroudis, D.C.Md., 23 F.2d
214, 216.

relation to a ship in distress, proffers useful serv-
ice, and gives it as a volunteer adventurer, with-
out any pre-existing covenant that connected him

ervation of that ship. The Clara, 23 Wall. 16, 23
L.Ed. 150; The Dumper, C.C.A.N.Y., 129 F. 99,
63 C.C.A. 600; Central Stockyard Co. v. Mears,

thing. Crapo v. Brown, 40 Iowa 487, 493. When
preceded by the definite article, meaning the one
just referred to. In re Conner's Estate, 318 Pa.
150, 178 A. 15, 17.

## SAME INVENTION

whatever invention was described in original
letters patent, and appears therein to have been
intended to be secured thereby. 35 U.S.C.A. § 64;
Morgan v. Drake, Cust. & Pat.App., 36 F.2d 511,
512. It is not to be determined by the claims of
the original patent but from the description and
such other evidence as the commissioner may
deem relevant. Detrola Radio & Television Cor-
poration v. Hazeltine Corporation, C.C.A.Mich.,
117 F.2d 238, 241.

## SAME OFFENSE

As used in Constitution, pro-
viding that no person shall be twice put in jeop-
ardy for the same offense, does not signify the
same offense eo nomine, but the same criminal act,
transaction, or omission. State v. Shaver, 197
Iowa 1028, 198 N.W. 329, 336.

## SAMPLE

SANCTION, n. In the original sense of the word,
a penalty or punishment provided as a means of
enforcing obedience to a law. In jurisprudence,
a law is said to have a sanction when there is a
state which will intervene if it is disobeyed or
disregarded. Therefore international law has no
legal sanction. Sweet.
In a more general sense, a conditional evil
annexed to a law to produce obedience to that
law; and, in a still wider sense, an authorization
of anything. Occasionally, "sanction" is used
(e. g., in Roman law) to denote a statute, the
part (penal clause) being used to denote the
whole. Brown.

which ordains or denounces a penalty for its vio-
lation. 1 Bl.Comm, 56.

155 S.W.2d 374, 377.

## SANE MEMORY

Sound mind, memory, and un-
derstanding. This is one of the essential ele-
ments in the capacity of contracting; and the
absence of it in lunatics and idiots, and its im-
maturity in infants, is the cause of their respective
incapacities or partial incapacities to bind them-
selves. The like circumstance is their ground of
exemption in cases of crime. Brown.
SANG, or SANG. In old French. Blood.
SANGUINE, or MURREY. An heraldic term for

being satisfied. Seago v. New York Cent. R. Co.,
349 Mo. 1249; 164 S.W.2d 336, 341. The discharge
of an obligation by paying a party what is due
to him, (as on a mortgage, lien, or contract,) or
what is awarded to him, by the judgment of a
court or otherwise. Thus, a judgment is satisfied
by the payment of the amount due to the party
who has recovered such judgment, or by his levy-
ing the amount. Bryant v. Fairfield, 51 Me. 152;
Armour Bros. Banking Co. v. Addington, 37 S.W.

Practice
An entry made on the record, by which a party
in whose favor a judgment was rendered declares
that he has been satisfied and paid.
Equity
The doctrine of satisfaction in equity is some-
what analogous to performance in equity, but
differs from it in this respect: that satisfaction is
always something given either in whole or in part
as a substitute or equivalent for something else,
and not (as in performance) something that may
be construed as the identical thing covenanted to
be done. Brown.

## SATISFACTION, CONTRACTS TO

contracts in which one party agrees to perform his
promise to the satisfaction of the other. A con-
tract for construction work "to the entire satis-
faction of the owners" imports that the construc-

not to the personal satisfaction of owners. Waite
v. C. E. Shoemaker & Co., 50 Mont. 264, 146 P. 736,
SATISFACTION PIECE. In practice. A memo-
randum in writing, entitled in a cause, stating that
satisfaction is acknowledged between the parties,
plaintiff and defendant. Upon this being duly ac-
knowledged and filed in the office where the rec-
ord of the judgment is, the judgment becomes
satisfied, and the defendant discharged from it.
1 Archb.Pr. 722.

FUND WHICH HAS SUSTAINED THE LOSS.
4 Bouv. Inst. no. 3731.

## SATISFACTORY

Where a contract provides that
it is to be performed in a manner "satisfactory" to
one of the parties, the provision must be construed
as meaning that the performance must be such
that the party, as a reasonable person, should be
satisfied with it. Hoff v. L. Gould & Co., 198 Ill.
App. 499, 501.

## SATISFACTORY EVIDENCE

Such evidence as
is sufficient to produce a belief that the thing is
true; credible evidence; such evidence as, in re-
spect to its amount or weight, is adequate or suf-
ficient to justify the court or jury in adopting the
conclusion in support of which it is adduced.
Walker. v. Collins, C.C.A.Kan., 59 F. 74, 8 C.C.A.

Lat. In practice. A judicial
writ, founded upon some matter of record, such
as a judgment or recognizance and requiring the
person against whom it is brought to show cause
why the party bringing it should not have advan-
tage of such record, or (in the case of a scire
facias to repeal letters patent) why the record
should not be annulled and vacated. 2 Archb.Pr.
K.B. 86; Pub. St. Mass. p. 1295. The name is
used to designate both the writ and the whole
proceeding. City of St. Louis v. Miller, 235 Mo.
The most common application of this writ is as
a process to revive a judgment, after the lapse
of a certain time, or on a change of parties, or
otherwise to have execution of the judgment, in
which cases it is merely a continuation of the
original action. It is used more rarely as a mode
of proceeding against special bail on their recog-
nizance, and as a means of repealing letters pat-
ent, in which cases it is an original proceeding.

## SCIRE FACIAS FOR THE CROWN

In English
law. The summary proceeding by extent is only
resorted to when a crown debtor is insolvent, or
there is good ground for supposing that the debt
may be lost by delay.' In ordinary cases where a
debt or duty appears by record to be owing to the
crown, the process for the crown is a writ of sci.
fa. quare executionem non; but should the de-
fendant become insolvent pending this writ, the
crown may abandon the proceeding and resort
to an extent. Wharton.

## SCIRE FACIAS QUARE RESTITUTIONEM NON

This writ lies where execution on a judg-
ment has been levied, but the money has not been

restitution can issue. Chit. 582; Fost. on Sci. Fa.

its of the British Isles; in America, outside the

state, as the case may be.

English doctrine, the high sea begins at the dis-
tance of three miles from the coast of any coun-
try; according to the American view, at low-wa-
ter mark, except in the case of small harbors and

the margin is high-water mark. The sea-shore is
therefore all the ground between the ordinary
high-water mark and low-water mark. It cannot
be considered as including any ground always cov-
ered •by the sea, for then it would have no definite
limit on the sea-board. Neither can it include
any part of the upland, for the same reason.

York, 46 S.Ct. 357, 362, 271 U.S. 65, 70 L.Ed. 838;

the same effect, and must be treated in the same
manner, as if returned in open court before any
separation of the jury had taken place. Sutliff v.
Gilbert, 8 Ohio, 408; Young v. Seymour, 4 Neb.

Co., 249 N.Y.S. 358, 365, 232 App.Div. 104, holding

## SEAWORTHINESS

In marine insurance. A
warranty of seaworthiness means that the vessel
is competent to resist the ordinary attacks of wind
and weather, and is competently equipped and
manned for the voyage, with a sufficient crew, and
with sufficient means to sustain them, and with
a captain of general good character and nautical
skill. 3 Kent, Comm. 287.
A warranty of seaworthiness extends not only
to the condition of the structure of the ship itself,
but requires that it be properly laden, and pro-
vided with a competent master, a sufficient num-
ber of competent officers and seamen, and the req-
uisite appurtenances and equipments, such as bal-
last, cables and anchors, cordage and sails, food,
water, fuel, and lights, and other necessary or
proper stores and implements for the voyage.
See, also, Seaworthy.
"Seaworthiness" involves no more than reasonable fitness
for purpose of a voyage. In re Gravel Products Corpora-
tion, C.C.A.N.Y., 24 F.2d 702, 703.

## SEAWORTHY

This adjective, applied to a ves-
sel, signifies that she is properly constructed, pre-
pared, manned, equipped, and provided, for the
voyage intended. See Seaworthiness.
The term "seaworthy" is somewhat equivocal. In its
more literal sense, it signifies capable of navigating the
sea; but, more exactly, it implies a condition to be and
remain in safety, in the condition she is in, whether at sea,
in port, or on a railway, stripped and under repairs. If,
when the policy attaches, she is in a suitable place, and
capable, when repaired and equipped, of navigating the
sea, she is seaworthy. But where a vessel is warranted
seaworthy for a specified voyage, the place and usual
length being given, something more is implied than mere
physical strength and capacity; she must be suitably offi-
cered and manned, supplied with provisions and water,
and furnished with charts and instruments, and, especially
in time of war, with documents necessary to her security
against hostile capture. The term "seaworthy," as used in
the law and practice of insurance, does not mean, as the
term would seem to imply, capable of going to sea or of
being navigated on the sea; it imports something very dif-
ferent, and much more, viz., that she is sound, staunch, and
strong, in all respects, and equipped, furnished, and pro-
vided with officers and men, provisions and documents,
for a certain service. In a policy for a definite voyage,
the term "seaworthy" means "sufficient for such a vessel
and voyage." Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock
Co. v. Watson, C.C.A.Va., 19 F.2d 832, 833; The Newport,
C.C.A.Cal., 7 F.2d 452, 453.

postponement in respect to rank, lien, order, or

missible, as being the next best, when the primary
or est evidence of the fact in question is lost or
inaccessible; as when a witness details orally
the contents of an instrument which is lost or
destroyed. Williams v. Davis, 56 Tex. 253; Bau-

IIS ACCINGUNTUR, ITA REI MUNIUNTUR EX-
CEPTIONIBUS, ET DEFENDUNTUR, QUASI,
CLYPEIS. Hob. 20. A suit is a civil warfare;

The distinction between "sedition" and "treason" con-
sists in this : that though the ultimate object of sedi-

liament, or the administration of justice, or to ex-

by lawful means the alteration of any matter in
church or state by law established, or to promote

## SEDUCTION

The act of seducing. Act of man
enticing woman to have unlawful intercourse with

es, bribes, or other means without employment of
force. Van De Velde v. Colle, 8 N.J.Misc. 782, 152
A. 645, 646.
At common law seduction is recognized merely as creat-
ing a civil liability, and actions for seduction are based
solely upon relation of master and servant and no one but
those entitled to services can maintain action. Under stat-
utory provisions in many states the woman is now permit-
ted to recover for her own seduction.
In many states seduction has been made a criminal of-
fense. Previous chaste character of the woman at time
of seduction is essential under some statutes.

64 Am.Dec. 290; Peterson v. Hubbard, 28 Mich.
SEIGNIOR, in its general signification, means
"lord," but in law it is particularly applied to the
lord of a fee or of a manor; and the fee, do-
minions, or manor of a seignior is thence termed
a "seigniory," i. e., a lordship. He who is a lord,
but of no manor, and therefore unable to keep a
court, is termed a "seignior in gross." Kitch.
206; Cowell.
Seignior or Seigneur. Among the feudists, this name
signified lord of the fee. Fitzh.N.B. 23. Seigneur is still
used in French Canada. The most extended signification
of this word includes not only a lord or peer of parliament,
but is applied to the owner or proprietor of a thing, hence
the owner of a hawk, and the master of a fishing vessel, is
called a seigneur. 37 Edw. III, c. 19; Barrington, Stat.

## SEIGNIORAGE

## SEISED IN DEMESNE AS OF FEE

This is the
strict technical expression used to describe the
ownership in "an estate in fee-simple in posses-
sion in a corporeal hereditament." The word
"seised" is used to express the "seisin" or owner's
possession of a freehold property; the phrase "in
demesne," or "in his demesne," (in dominico suo)
signifies that he is seised as owner of the land
itself, and not merely of the seigniory or services;
and the concluding words, "as of fee," import that
he is seised of an estate of inheritance in fee-
simple. Where the subject is incorporeal, or the
estate expectant on a precedent freehold, the
words "in his demesne" are omitted. (Co. Litt.
17a; Fleta, 1. 5, c. 5, § 18; Bract. 1. 4, tr. 5, c. 2,
§ 2.) Brown.

## SEISI

In old English law. Seised; possessed.

## SEISIN

The completion of the feudal investiture,
by which the tenant was admitted into the feud,
and performed the rights of homage and fealty.
Stearns, Real Act. 2. Possession with an intent
on the part of him who holds it to claim a free-
hold interest. Deshong v. Deshong, 186 Pa. 227,
40 A. 402, 65 Am.St.Rep. 855. Right to immediate
possession according to the nature of the estate.
Williams v. Swango, 365 Ill. 549, 7 N.E.2d 306, 309.
Upon the introduction of the feudal law into England,
the word "seisin" was applied only to the possession of
an estate of freehold, in contradistinction to that precarious
kind of possession by which tenants in villeinage held their
lands, which was considered to be the possession of those
in whom the freehold continued. The word still retains
its original signification, being applied exclusively to the
possession of land of a freehold tenure, it being inaccurate
to use the word as expressive of the possession of lease-
holds or terms of years, or even of copyholds. Brown.
Under our law, the word "seisin" has no accurately de-
fined technical meaning. At common law, it imported a
feudal investiture of title by actual possession. With us
it has the force of possession under some legal title or
right to hold. This possession, so far as possession alone
is involved, may be shown by parol; but, if it is intended
to show possession under a legal title, then the title must
be shown by proper conveyance for that purpose. Ford
v. Garner, 49 Ala. 603.
Every person in whom a seisin is required by any of the
provisions of this chapter shall be deemed to have been
seised, if he may have had any right, title, or interest in
the inheritance. G.S.N.C. §1 29-1, rule 12.
Actual Seisin
Possession of the freehold by the pedis positio
of one's self or one's tenant or agent, or by con-
struction of law, as in the case of a state grant
or a conveyance under the statutes of uses, or
(probably) of grant or devise where there is no
actual adverse possession; it means actual pos-
session as distinguished from constructive posses-
sion or possession in law. Carr v. Anderson, 6
App.Div. 6, 39 N.Y.S. 746.
Constructive Seisin
Seisin in law where there is no seisin in fact;
as where the state issues a patent to a person who
never takes any sort of possession of the lands
granted, he has constructive seisin of all the land
in his grant, though another person is at the time
in actual possession. Garrett v. Ramsey, 26 W.Va.
Covenant of Seisin
See Covenant.
Equitable Seisin
A seisin which is analogous to legal seisin; that
is, seisin of an equitable estate in land. Thus a
mortgagor is said to have equitable seisin of the
land by receipt of the rents. Sweet.
Livery of Seisin
Delivery of possession; called, by the feudists,
"investiture."
Primer Seisin
In English law. The right which the king had,
when any of his tenants died seised of a knight's
fee, to receive of the heir, provided he were of full
age, one whole year's profits of the lands, if they
were in immediate possession; and half a year's
profits, if the lands were in reversion, expectant
on an estate for life. 2 Bl. Comm. 66.
Quasi Seisin
A, term applied to the possession which a copy-
holder has of the land to which he has been ad-
mitted. The freehold in copyhold lands being
in the lord, the copyholder cannot have seisin of
them in the proper sense of the word, but he has
a customary or quasi seisin analogous to that of
a freeholder. Williams, Seis. 126; Sweet.
Seisin in Deed
Actual possession of the freehold; the same as
actual seisin or seisin in fact. Roetzel v. Beal, 196
Ark. 5, 116 S.W.2d 591, 593.
Seisin in Fact
Possession with intent on the part of him who
holds it to claim a freehold interest; the same as
actual seisin. Seim v. O'Grady, 42 W.Va. 77, 24
S.E. 994; Savage v. Savage, 19 Or. 112, 23 P. 890,
20 Am.St.Rep. 795.
Seisin in Law
A right of immediate possession according to
the nature of the estate. Martin v. Trail, 142 Mo.
85, 43 S.W. 655; Savage v. Savage, 19 Or. 112, 23
P. 890, 20 Am.St.Rep. 795. As the old doctrine of
corporeal investiture is no longer in force, the de-
livery of a deed gives seisin in law. Watkins v.
Nugen, 118 Ga. 372, 45 S.E. 262.
Seisin Ox
In Scotch law. A perquisite formerly due to
the sheriff when he gave possession to an heir
holding crown lands. It was long since converted
into a payment in money, proportioned to the
value of the estate. Bell.

## SEISINA

L. Lat. Seisin.

## SEISINA FACIT STIPITEM

Seisin makes the
stock. 2 BL Comm. 209; Broom, Max. 525, 528.

## SEISINA HABENDA

A writ for delivery of
seisin to the lord, of lands and tenements, after
the sovereign, in right of his prerogative, had had
the year, day, and waste on a felony committed,
etc. Reg. Orig. 165.

## SEIZE

To put in possession, invest with fee sim-
ple, be seized of or in, be legal possessor of, or be
holder in fee simple. Hanley v. Stewart, 155 Pa.
Super. 535, 39 A.2d 323, 326.

## SEIZIN

See Seisin.

## SEIZING OF HERIOTS

Taking the best beast,
etc., where an heriot is due, on the death of the
tenant. 2 Bl. Comm. 422.

## SEIZURE

To take possession of forcibly, to
grasp, to snatch, or to put in possession. Hardie
v. State, 140 Tex.Cr.R. 368, 144 S.W.2d 571, 575.
Law of Copyholds
Seizure is where the lord of copyhold lands
takes possession of them in default of a tenant.
It is either seizure quousque or absolute seizure.
Practice
The act performed by an officer of the law, un-
der the authority and exigence of a writ, in taking
into the custody of the law the property, real or
personal, of a person against whom the judgment
of a competent court has passed, condemning
him to pay a certain sum of money, in order that
such property may be sold, by authority and due
course of law, to satisfy the judgment. Or the act
of taking possession of goods in consequence of
a violation of public law. Carey v. Insurance Co.,
54 N.W. 18, 84 Wis. 80, 20 L.R.A. 267, 36 Am.St.
Rep. 907.
Seizure, even though hostile, is not necessarily capture,
though such is its usual and probable result. The ultimate
act or adjudication of the state, by which the seizure has
been made, assigns the proper and conclusive quality and
denomination to the original proceeding. A condemnation
asserts a capture ab inittio; an award of restitution pro-
nounces upon the act as having been not a valid act of
capture, but an act of temporary seizure only. Appleton
v. Crowninshield, 3 Mass. 443.

## SEIZURE QUOUSQUE

Where the heir on the
death of his ancestor postpones claiming admit-
tance from the lord, the lord may, after a reason-
able time, and after due proclamation at three suc-
cessive courts, seize the tenement into his hands
quousque, e. until an heir appears and claims
admittance; Jenks, Mod. Land L. 208.

## SELDA

wood of sallows or willows; also a sawpit. Co.
Litt. 4.

The name given, in some
states, to the upper house or branch of the coun-
cil of a city.

## SELECTI JUDICES

Lat. In Roman law. Judg-
es who were selected very much like our juries.
They were returned by the praetor, drawn by lot,
subject to be challenged, and sworn. 3 Bl. Comm.

## SELECTMEN

The name of certain municipal
officers, in the New England states, elected by the
towns to transact their general public business,
and possessing certain executive powers. Felch
v. Weare, 69 N.H. 617, 45 A. 591.

## SELF-DEALING

Basically relates to transac.
tions wherein a trustee, acting for himself and
also as "trustee," a relation which demands strict
fidelity to others, seeks to consummate a deal
wherein self-interest is opposed to duty. Cestui
or disaffirm, unless countervailing equities have
intervened. First Nat. Bank v. Basham, 238 Ala.
500, 191 So. 873, 876, 877, 878, 125 A.L.R. 656; In
re Binder's Estate, 137 Ohio St. 26, 27 N.E.2d 939,
947, 129 A.L.R. 130.

## SELF-DEFENSE

The protection of one's per-
son or property against some injury attempted by
another. The right of such protection. An ex-
cuse for the use of force in resisting an attack
on the person, and especially for killing an assail-
ant. Whart. Crim. Law, §§ 1019, 1026. The right
of a man to repel force by force even to the tak-
ing of life in defense of his person, property or
habitation, or of a member of his family, against
any one who manifests, intends, attempts or en-
deavors by violence or surprise, to commit a
forcible felony. State v. Patterson, 45 Vt. 308, 12
Am.Rep. 200; Logue v. Com., 38 Pa. 265, 80 Am.
Dec. 481. Essential elements of "self-defense"
are that defendant does not provoke difficulty
and that there must be impending peril without
convenient or reasonable mode of escape. Hayes
v. State, 225 Ala. 253, 142 So. 675, 677. The law
of "self-defense" justifies an act done in the rea-
sonable belief of immediate danger, and, if an
injury was done by defendant in justifiable self-
defense, he can never be punished criminally nor
held responsible for damages in a civil action.
Baltimore Transit Co. v. Faulkner, 179 Md. 598,
20 A.2d 485, 487.
Accused is not justified in pursuing and killing attacker
when danger of death or serious bodily injury has passed.
People v. Keys, 62 Cal.App.2d 903, 145 P.2d 589, 596.

## SELF-EXECUTING CONSTITUTIONAL PRO- VISION

Immediately effective without the nec-
essity of ancillary legislation. Cleary v. Kincaid,
23 Idaho, 789, 131 P. 1117, 1118; Stange v. City
of Cleveland, 94 Ohio St. 377, 114 N.E. 261, 262.
Constitutional provision is "self-executing" if it supplies
sufficient rule by which right given may be enjoyed or duty
imposed enforced; constitutional provision is not "self-
executing" when it merely indicates principles without lay-
ing down- rules giving them force of law. Zachary v. City
of Wagoner, 146 Okl. 268, 292 P. 345, 348; State v. Per-
rault, 34 N.M. 438, 283 P. 902, 903.

## SELF-EXECUTING JUDGMENTS

Those re-
quiring no affirmative action of the court or ac-
tion under process issued by the court to execute
them. /Etna Casualty & Surety Co. of Hartford,
Conn., v. Board of Sup'rs of Warren County, 160
Va. 11, 168 S.E. 617, 629.

these terms are not inapplicable to the persons
concerned in a transfer of real estate, it is more
customary to use "vendor" and "purchaser," or
SELLETTE (Fr.). A kind of woollen seat set up
in criminal courts in France, on which they placed
the accused to undergo his last interrogatory when
the conclusions of the counsel for the prosecution
went against him with regard to capital punish-
ment or at least penal corporal punishment. It
implied moral degradation and was therefore lim-
ited to persons accused of crimes entailing cor-
poral punishment. Ord. Cr. de 1670, Tibre IV,
art. 21. Abolished by Edict of May 1, 1788. Call-
ed a "stool of repentance."
SELLING PUBLIC OFFICES. Buying or selling
any office in the gift of the crown, or making any
ivegotiation relating thereto, was deemed a mis-
demeanor under stats. 5 & 6 Edw. VI. c. 16, and 49
Geo. III. c. 126, 2 Steph. Com., 11th ed. 631.

## SELLING STOCKS SHORT

Selling stocks cus-
tomer does not possess, customer borrowing the
number of shares he has sold from some third
person to deliver to his vendee expecting to be able
to buy the stocks later at a lower figure and return
them to the person from whom he borrowed them.
Henderson v. Usher, 125 Fla. 709, 170 So. 846, 851.

## SEMAYNE'S CASE

This case decided, in 1604,
that "every man's house [meaning his dwelling-
house only] is his castle," and that an officer
executing civil process may not break open outer
doors in general, but only inner doors, but that
(after request made) he may break open even
outer doors to find goods of another wrongfully
in the house. Brown. It is reported in 5 Coke, 91.

## SEMBLE

L. Fr. It seems; it would appear.
This expression is often used in the reports to pre-
face a statement by the court upon a point of law
which is not directly decided, when such state-
ment is intended as an intimation of what the de-
cision would be if the point were necessary to be
passed upon. It is also used to introduce a sugges-
tion by the reporter, or his understanding of the
point decided when it is not free from obscurity.

ceedings. Phillim. Ecc. Law, 1260.
Excessive sentence. See Excessive Sentence.
Final sentence. One which puts an end to a
case. Distinguished from interlocutory.
Indeterminate sentence. A form of sentence to
imprisonment upon conviction of crime, now au-
thorized by statute in several states, which, instead
of fixing rigidly the duration of the imprisonment,
declares that it shall be for a period "not less
than" so many years "nor more than" so many
years, or not less than the minimum period pre-
,
scribed by statute as the punishment for the par-
ticular offense nor more than the maximum per-
iod, the exact length of the term being afterwards
fixed, within the limits assigned by the court or
the statute, by an executive authority, (the gov-
ernor, board of pardons, etc.,) on consideration of
the previous record of the convict, his behavior
while in prison or while out on parole, the appar-
ent prospect of reformation and other such con-
siderations.

of the court, be indefinite as to time, or during
the good behavior of the prisoner. See People v.

As to removal of
causes from state courts to federal courts, this
phrase means a separate and distinct cause of
action existing in the suit, on which a separate and
distinct suit might properly have been brought
and complete relief afforded as to such cause of
action; or the case must be one capable of sep-
aration into parts, so that, in one of the parts, a
controversy will be presented, wholly between cit-
izens of different states, which can be fully de-
termined without the presence of any of the
other parties to the suit as it has been begun.
Fraser v. Jennison, 1 S.Ct. 171, 106 U.S. 191, 27 L.
Ed. 131; Gudger v. Western N. C. R. Co., C.C.N.
C., 21 F. 81; Steed v. Henry, 180 S.W. 508, 509,

49 F.Supp. 137, 139, 141, 143.

## SEPARALITER

dictments to indicate that two or more defendants

16, 171 N.E. 352, 353.
SEPARATE, adj. Individual; distinct; particu-
lar; disconnected. Generally used in law as op-
posed to "joint," though the more usual antith-
esis of the latter term is "several." Either of
these words implies division, distribution, discon-
nection, or aloofness. Merrill v. Pepperdine, 9
Ind.App. 416, 36 N.E. 921.

## SEPARATE DEMISE IN EJECTMENT

A de-
mise in a declaration in ejectment used to be
termed a "separate demise" when made by the les-

demise, either separate or joint, is now necessary
in this action. Brown.

## SEPARATE ESTATE

The individual property of
one of two persons who stand in a social or busi-
ness relation, as distinguished from that which
they own jointly or are jointly interested in.
Thus, "separate estate," within the meaning of the
bankrupt law, is that in which each partner is
separately interested at the time of the bank-
ruptcy. The term can only be applied to such
property as belonged to one or more of the part-
ners, to the exclusion of the rest. In re Lowe,
11 Nat. Bankr. Rep. 221, F.Cas.No.8,564. The sep-
arate estate of a married woman is that which be-
longs to her, and over which her husband has
no right in equity. It may consist of lands or
chattels. Williams v. King, 29 F.Cas. 1,369.

without compulsion or constraint of the husband.
Also the examination of a witness in private or
apart from, and out of the hearing of, the other
witnesses in the same cause.

## SEPARATE MAINTENANCE

Allowance grant-
ed to a wife for support of herself and children
while she is living apart from her husband. Cohn
v. Cohn, 4 Wash.2d 322, 103 P.2d 366, 367.
Alimony in its strict sense is confined to an allowance
made to a wife who is legally separated or divorced from
husband, but in many jurisdictions courts have authority
to make an allowance to a wife who is living separate and
apart, from her husband without being legally separated or
divorced, and this allowance is often called "separate
maintenance." Dyer v. Dyer, 212 N.C. 620, 194 S.E. 278.

## SEPARATE PROPERTY

Property owned by
married person in his or her own right during
marriage. In re Morgan's Estate, 203 Cal. 569,
265 P. 241, 245. See, also, Separate Estate.
Of a married woman. That which she owns in her own
right, which is liable only for her own debts, and which
she can encumber and dispose of at her own will.
"Separate property" continues to be such as long as it
can clearly be traced and identified, and its rents, issues,
and profits remain separate property. True v. United
States, D.C.Wash., 51 F.Supp. 720, 723, 726.

## SEPARATE TRIAL

The separate and individual
trial of each of several persons jointly accused of
a crime.

ruff, 215 N.C. 685, 3 S.E.2d 5, 6,
SEPARATION A MENSA ET THORO. A partial
dissolution of the marriage relation.

## SEPARATION OF PATRIMONY

In Louisiana
probate law. The creditors of the succession may
demand, in every case and against every creditor
of the heir, a separation of the property of the
succession from that of the heir. This is what
is called the "separation of patrimony." The ob-
ject of a separation of patrimony is to prevent
property out of which a particular class of credi-
tors have a right to be paid from being confound-
ed with other property, and by that means made
liable to the debts of another class of creditors.
Civ.Code La. art. 1444.

## SEPARATION ORDER

In England, where a
husband is convicted of an aggravated assault
upon his wife, the court or magistrate may order
that the wife shall be no longer bound to cohabit
with him. Such an order has the same effect as a
judicial decree of separation on the ground of
cruelty. It may also provide for the payment of
a weekly sum by the husband to the wife and for
SEPARATISTS. Seceders from the Church of
England. They, like Quakers, solemnly affirm,
instead of taking the usual oath, before they give
evidence.

## SEPES

closure. The inclosure of a trench or canal. Dig.
43, 21, 4.

another. In re Flint, 32 C.C.P.A. 1116, 150 F.2d
126, 131.

## SERIATIM

Lat. Severally; separately; indi-
vidually; one by one.

## SERIOUS

## SERIOUS ILLNESS

In life insurance. An ill-
ness that permanently or materially impairs, or
is likely to permanently or materially impair, the
h"alth of the applicant. Not every illness is ser-
ious. An illness may be alarming at the time, or
thought to be serious by the one afflicted, and yet
not be serious in the sense of that term as used
in insurance contracts. An illness that is tern-
porary in its duration, and entirely passes away,
and is not attended, nor likely to be attended, by
a permanent or material impairment of the health
or constitution, is not a serious illness. It is not
sufficient that the illness was thought serious at
the time it occurred, or that it might have resulted
in permanently impairing the health. Fishbeck
v. New York Life Ins. Co., 179 Wis. 369, 192 N.W.
170, 175; American Nat. Ins. Co. v. Hicks, Tex.Civ.
App., 198 S.W. 616, 622.

## SERJEANT

The same word etymologically with
"sergeant," but the latter spelling is more com-
monly employed in the designation of military and
police officers, (see Sergeant,) while the former is
preferred when the term is used to describe cer-
tain grades of legal practitioners and certain of-
ficers of legislative bodies. See infra.
Common Serjeant
A judicial officer attached to the corporation of
the city of London, who assists the recorder in
disposing of the criminal business at the Old Bail-
ey sessions, or central criminal court. Brown.
Serjeant at Arms
An executive officer appointed by, and attend.
ing on, a legislative body, whose principal duties
are to execute its warrants, preserve order, and
Serjeant at Law
A barrister of the common-law courts of high
standing, and of much the same rank as a doctor
of law is in the ecclesiastical courts. These ser-
jeants seem to have derived their title from the
old knights templar, (among whom there existed
a peculiar class under the denomination of "frêres
sergens," or "fratres servientes,") and to have
continued as a separate fraternity from a very
early period in the history of the legal profession.
The barristers who first assumed the old monastic
title were those who practiced in the court of com-
mon pleas, and until a recent period (the 25th of
April, 1834, 9 & 10 Viet. c. 54) the serjeants at law
always had the exclusive privilege of practice
in that court. Every judge of a common-law
court, previous to his elevation to the bench, used
to be created a serjeant at law; but since the
judicature act this is no longer necessary. Brown.
Serjeant of the Mace
In English law. An officer who attends the lord
mayor of London, and the chief magistrates of
other corporate towns. Holthouse.
Serjeants' Inn
The inn to which the serjeants at law belonged,
near Chancery lane; formerly called "Faryndon
Inn."
SERJEANTIA IDEM EST QUOD SERVITIUM.
Co.Litt. 105. Serjeanty is the same as service.

## SERJEANTY

A species of tenure by knight serv-
ice, which was due to the king only, and was dis-
tinguished into grand and petit serjeanty. The
tenant holding by grand serjeanty was bound, in-
stead of attending the king generally in his wars,
to do some honorary service to the king in per-
son, as to carry his banner or sword, or to be his
butler, champion, or other officer at his corona-
tion. Petit serjeanty differed from grand ser-
jeanty, in that the service rendered to the king
was not of a personal nature, but consisted in ren-
dering him annually some small implement of
war, as a bow, sword, arrow, lance, or the like.
Cowell; Brown.

## SERMENT

In old English law. Oath; an oath.

## SERMO INDEX ANIMI

and, in respect of their quantity and the time of
exacting them, were either certain or uncertain. 2

Practice
The exhibition or delivery of a writ, notice, in-
junction, etc., by an authorized person, to a person
who is thereby officially notified of some action
or proceeding in which he is concerned, and is
thereby advised or warned of some action or step
which he is commanded to take or to forbear.

Constructive service of process. Any form of
cation of an action or of some proceeding therein,
given to a person affected by sending it to him in
the mails or causing it to be published in a news-
paper.
Personal service. Of a writ or notice is made
by delivering it to the person named, in person,
Georgia Casualty Co. v. McClure, Tex.Civ.App.,
239 S.W. 644, 647; or handing him a copy and in-
forming him of the nature and terms of the orig-
inal. Leaving a copy at his place of abode is not
personal service. Moyer v. Cook, 12 Wis. 336. But
where a person named in a summons is of un-
sound mind, service upon the guardian of such
person may be deemed "personal service." Pat-
tison v. Grand Trust & Savings Co., 195 Ind. 313,
144 N.E. 26, 29. Some courts hold to the view that
the mailing of a notice is not personal service.

monses, rules, etc., signifies the delivering to or
leaving them with the party to whom or with

and the original is shown. Brown.
Special service. In Scotch law. That form of
service by which the heir is served to the ances-
tor who was feudally vested in the lands. Bell.
Substituted service. Any form of service of
process other than personal service, such as serv-

service of a writ or notice on some person other
than the one directly concerned, for example, his
attorney of record, who has authority to repre-
sent him or to accept service for him.

SERVITUDE.
The Condition of being Bound to Service
The state of a person who is subjected, volun-
tarily or otherwise, to another person as his serv-
ant. Shilling v. State, 143 Miss. 709, 109 So. 737,
A Charge or Burden
A charge or burden resting upon one estate
for the benefit or advantage of another; a species
of incorporeal right derived from the civil law
(see Servitus) and closely corresponding to the
"easement" of the common-law, except that "serv-
itude" rather has relation to the burden or the
estate burdened, while "easement" refers to the
benefit or advantage or the estate to which it ac-
crues. Rowe v. Nally, 81 Md. 367, 32 A. 198; Los
Angeles Terminal Land Co. v. Muir, 136 Cal. 36,
68 P. 308.
The term "servitude," in its original and popular sense,
signifies the duty of service, or rather the condition of one
who is liable to the performance of services. The word,
however, in its legal sense, is applied figuratively to things.
When the freedom of ownership in land is fettered or re-
stricted, by reason of some person, other than the owner
thereof, having some right therein, the land is said to
"serve" such person. The restricted condition of the own-
ership or the right which forms the subject-matter of the
restriction is termed a "servitude," and the land so bur-
dened with another's right is termed a "servient tene-
ment," while the land belonging to the person enjoying the
right is called the "dominant tenement." The word "ser-
vitude" may be said to have both a positive and a negative
signification; in the former sense denoting the restrictive
right belonging to the entitled party; in the latter, the
restrictive duty entailed upon the proprietor or possessor
of the servient land. Brown.
Classification
All servitudes which affect lands may be divided
into two kinds,—personal and real. Personal
servitudes are those attached to the person for
whose benefit they are established, and terminate
with his life. This kind of servitude is of three
sorts,—usufruct, use, and habitation. Real servi-
tudes, which are also called "predial" or "landed"
servitudes, are those which the owner of an estate
enjoys on a neighboring estate for the benefit of
his own estate. They are called "predial" or "land-
ed" servitudes because, being established for the
benefit of an estate, they are rather due to the
estate than to the owner personally. Frost-John-
son Lumber Co. v. Sailing's Heirs, 150 La. 756, 91
So. 207, 245; Tide-Water Pipe Co.. v. Bell, 280 Pa.
104, 124 A. 351, 354, 40 A.L.R.‘ 1516.
Real servitudes are divided, in the civil law,
into rural and urban servitudes. Rural servitudes
are such as are established for the benefit of a
landed estate; such, for example, as a right of
way over the servient tenement, or of access to a
spring, a coal-mine, a sand-pit, or a wood that is
upon it. Urban servitudes are such as are estab-
lished for the benefit of one building over another.
(But the buildings need not be in the city, as the
name would apparently imply.) They are such
as the right of support, or of view, or of drip or
sewer, or the like. Mackeld. Rom. Law, § 316,
et seq.
Servitudes are also classed as positive and neg-
ative. A positive servitude is one which obliges
the owner of the servient estate to permit or suf-
fer something to be done on his property by an-
other. A negative servitude is one which does not
bind the servient proprietor to permit something
to be done upon his property by another, but mere-
ly restrains him from making a certain use of
his property which would impair the easement
enjoyed by the dominant tenement. Rowe v. Nal-
ly, 81 Md. 367, 32 A. 198.
Penal servitude. In English criminal law, a
punishment which consists in keeping the offend-
er in confinement and compelling him to labor.
Involuntary servitude. See Involuntary.

The sitting of a court, Legislature,
council, commission, etc., for the transaction of
its proper business. Hence, the period of time,
within any one day, during which such body is
assembled in form, and engaged in the transaction
of business, or, in a more extended sense, the
whole space of time from its first assembling to
its prorogation or adjournment sine die. Rails v.
Wyand, 40 Okl. 323, 138 P. 158, 162.
for transaction of business, after judge arrives and opens

So. 899, 900.
Synonyms
Strictly speaking, the word "session," as ap-
plied to a court of justice, is not synonymous with
the word "term." The "session" of a court is the
time during which it actually sits for the transac-
tion of judicial business, and hence terminates
each day with the rising of the court. A "term"
of court is the period fixed by law, usually embrac-
ing many days or weeks, during which it shall be
open for the transaction of judicial business and
during which it may hold sessions from day to
day. But this distinction is not always observed,
many authorities using the two words inter-
changeably. Muse v. Harris, 122 Okl. 250, 254 P.
72, 73; State v. City of Victoria, 97 Kan. 638, 156 P.
705, 708; Nation v. Savely, 127 Okl. 117, 260 P.
32, 35.

teen (formerly fifteen) judges, viz., the lord presi-
dent, the lord justice clerk, and eleven ordinary

mission of the peace and certain statutes. Gen-
eral sessions held at certain times in the four
quarters of the year pursuant to St. 2 Hen. V.
are properly called "quarter sessions," (q. v.,) but
intermediate general sessions may also be held.
Sweet.
Great session of Wales. A court which was
abolished by St. 1 Wm. IV. c. 70. The proceedings
now issue out of the courts at Westminster, and
two of the judges of the superior courts hold the

Joint session. In parliamentary practice, a
meeting together and commingling of the two
houses of a legislative body, sitting and acting to-
gether as one body, instead of separately in their

43 P. 262.
Petty sessions. In English law. A special or
petty session is sometimes kept in corporations
and counties at large by a few justices, for dis-

adopted. They are principally of use as directing
the order of business. Brown.
Sessions. A sitting of justices in court upon
their commission, or by virtue of their appoint-
ment, and most commonly for the trial of crim-
inal cases. The title of several courts in England
and the United States, chiefly those of criminal
jurisdiction. Burrill.
Special sessions. In English law. A meeting
of two or more justices of the peace held for a
special purpose, (such as the licensing of ale-
houses,) either as required by statute or when
specially convoked, which can only be convened
after notice to all the other magistrates of the
division, to give them an opportunity of attend-
ing. Stone, J. Pr. 52, 55.

change." Any one of them being paid, the others
become void.

## SET OUT

First Nc,t.:. Bank v. Engelbercht, 58 Neb. 639, 79

74 Or. 191, 144 P. 494, 497.

## SET UP

thing relied upon or deemed sufficient; to pro-
pose or interpose, by way of defense, explanation,
or justification; as, to set up the statute of lim-
itations, i. e., offer and rely upon it as a defense
to a claim.

## SETI

As used in mining laws, lease. Brown.
holds against plaintiff, arising out of a transaction
extrinsic of plaintiff's cause of action. Delco
Light Co. v. John Le Roy Hutchinson Properties,
128 So. 831, 99 Fla. 410. Counter-demand must be
liquidated or capable of liquidation and grow out
of a contract or judgment. Marks V. Spitz, D.C.
Mass., 4 F.R.D. 348, 350. A money demand inde-
pendent of and unconnected with plaintiff's cause
of action. Otto v. Lincoln Say. Bank of Brooklyn,
51 N.Y.S.2d 561, 563, 268 App.Div. 400. Only a
counter demand upon which defendant at com-
mencement of action might have maintained inde-
pendent suit. Armstrong v. Marr, 120 Neb. 182,
231 N.W. 758. It generally admits plaintiff's cause
of action. Cook v. Soden, 12 N.J.Misc. 337, 171 A.
558, 559.
"Set-off", both at law and in equity, is that right which
exists between two parties, each of whom under an inde-
pendent contract owes an ascertained amount to the other,
to set off his respective debt by way of mutual deduction,
so that in any action brought for the larger debt the resi-
due only, after such deduction, shall be recovered. John
Wills, Inc., v. Citizens Nat. Bank of Netcong, 125 N.J.L.
546, 16 A.2d 804, 806.
A set-off was unknown to the common law; according to
which mutual debts were distinct, and inextinguishable
except by actual payment, release or agreement. Scarano
v. Scarano, 132 N.J.Eq. 362, 28 A.2d 425, 429, 430. A de-
fendant who had a demand against plaintiff was com-
pelled to bring a separate suit or resort to an equity court
to have his claim set off. The English statute 2 Geo. II, c.
22, which has been generally adopted in the United States,
with some modifications, in cases of mutual debts, how-
ever, allowed the defendant to set his debt against the
other, either by pleading it in bar, or giving it in evidence,
where proper notice had been given of such intention,
under the general issue. The statute being made for the
benefit of defendant, is not compulsory. The defendant,
may waive his right, and bring a cross action against plain-
tiff. Himes v. Barnitz, 8 Watts, Pa., 39; 2 Camp. 594;
Hinckly v. Walters, 9 Watts, Pa., 179; Branham v. John-
son, 62 Md. 259.
Independent of statute the right of set-off is of equitable
origin and hence power to allow set-offs is inherent in
equity courts and courts of equity sometimes allow set-
offs where, for some technical reason, it could not be al-
lowed at law under statute. Colton v. Dovers' Perpetual
Building and Loan Ass'n, 90 Md. 85, 45 A. 23, 26, 46 L.R.A.
388, 78 Am.St. Rep. 431; Scarano v. Scarano, 132 N.J.Eq.
362, 28 A.2d 425, 429, 430.
It 'differs from counterclaim, in that a "counterclaim"
arises out of the same transaction described in the com-
plaint, while a "set-off" is independent thereof. Savings
Bank of New London v. Santaniello, 130 Conn. 206, 33
A.2d 126, 128.
For the distinction between set-off and recoupment, see
Recoupment.
"Set-off" differs from a "lien," inasmuch as the former
belongs exclusively to the remedy, and is merely a right to
insist, if the party think proper to do so, when sued by
his creditor on a counter-demand, which can only be en-

whole is thrown open as pasture for the cattle of all the
owners, and in some cases for the cattle of other persons

## SHAFT

An opening in the ground or in struc-
tures. Franklin v. Webber, 93 Or. 151, 182 P. 819,
SHALL. As used in statutes, contracts, or the

tory. McDunn v. Roundy, 191 Iowa, 976, 181 N.

burn, 232 Mass. 201, 122 N.E. 268; U. S. v. Two

79 W.Va. 50, 90 S.E. 530, 531, L.R.A.1917B, 723.
In common or ordinary parlance, and in its ordinary
signification, the term "shall" is a word of command, and
one which has always or which must be given a compulsory
meaning; as denoting obligation. It has a peremptory
meaning, and it is generally imperative or mandatory. It
has the invariable significance of excluding the idea of dis-
cretion, and has the significance of operating to impose a
duty which may be enforced, particularly if public policy
is in favor of this meaning, or when addressed to public
officials, or where a public interest is involved, or where
the public or persons have rights which ought to be exer-
cised or enforced, unless a contrary intent appears. Peo-
ple v. O'Rourke, 124 Cal. App. 752, 13 P.2d 989, 992.
But it may be construed as merely permissive or
directory, (as equivalent to "may,") to carry out
the legislative intention and in cases where no
taken in the imperative sense, and where no pub-
lic or private right is impaired by its interpreta-
tion in the other sense. Spaulding & Kimball v.
;Etna Chemical Co., 98 Vt. 169, 126 A. 588, 589;
Wisdom v. Board of Sup'rs of Polk County, 236
Iowa 669, 19 N.W.2d 602, 607, 608. Also, as against
the government, it is to be construed as "may,"
unless a contrary intention is manifest. Cairo &
Fulton R. Co. v. Hecht, 95 U.S. 170, 24 L.Ed. 423.
Although the word usually denotes an obliga-
tion, it also implies an element of futurity. Cun-
ningham v. Long, 125 Me. 494, 135 A. 198, 200;
Hemsley v. McKim, 119 Md. 431, 87 A. 506, 511.

## SHAM

Mfg. Co. v. Castles, 97 S.C. 389, 81 S.E. 665, 666;
Segerstrom v. Holland Piano Mfg. Co., 160 Minn.
95, 199 N.W. 897, 898. A sham pleading is there-
fore one good in form, but false in fact. Bollen
v. Woodhams, 68 Colo. 322, 190 P. 427.

those titles.

agreed to become a member of a corporation or
company, and with respect to whom all the re-
quired formalities have been gone through; e. g.,
signing of deed of settlement, registration, or the
like. A shareholder by estoppel is a person who
has acted and been treated as a shareholder, and
consequently has the same liabilities as if he were
an ordinary shareholder. Lind;. Partn. 130. Beal
v. Essex Say. Bank, C.C.A.Mass., 67 F. 816, 15 C.
C.A. 128; State v. Mitchell, 104 Tenn. 336, 58 S.W.

government or instruction; any book of instruc-
tions, particularly containing Divine ordinances.

taining the property of another by oppression and
extortion. Also used in an innocent sense to de-
note the buying of existing notes and other secur-
ities for money, at a discount. Hence to charge
a man with using money for shaving is not libel-
ous per se. Trentham v. Moore, 111 Tenn. 346,
76 S.W. 904.

## SHEEP

A term which ordinarily includes rams,
ewes, and lambs. Panhandle & 'S. F. Ry. Co. v.
Bell, Tex.Civ.App., 189 S.W. 1097, 1101. But in
the Stat. 7 & 8 Geo. IV, c. 29, § 25, making it a
felony to steal any "ram, ewe, sheep, or lamb,"
the word "sheep" should be used in indictments
only when it is intended to refer to a wether
more than a year old. Rex v. Birket, 4 Car. & P.

## SHEEP-HEAVES

Small plots of pasture, in
England, often in the middle of the waste of a
manor, of which the soil may or may not be in
the lord, but the pasture is private property, and
leased or sold as such. They principally occur in
the northern counties, (Cooke, Incl. Acts, 44,) and
seem to be corporeal hereditaments, (Elton, Com-
mons, 35,) although they are sometimes classed
with rights of common, but erroneously, the right
being an exclusive right of pasture. Sweet.

## SHEEP-SILVER

A service turned into money,
which was paid in respect that anciently the ten-
ants used to wash the lord's sheep. Wharton.

## SHEEP-SKIN

A deed; so called from the parch-
ment it was written on.

disorder, but a condition produced on certain
organisms by sudden fear, or by highly exciting
causes; it is a form of neurosis; it is not settled,
general insanity, but a functional nervous dis-
ease, and not due to organic changes. People v.
Gilberg, 197 Cal. 306, 240 P. 1000, 1002. See, also,
Shock.

## SHELLEY'S CASE, RULE IN

"When the ances-
tor, by any gift or conveyance, taketh an estate of
freehold, and in the same gift or conveyance an
estate is limited, either mediately or immediately,
to his heirs in fee or in tail, 'the heirs' are words
of limitation of the estate, and not words of pur-
chase." 1 Coke, 104; Winchell v. Winchell, 259 Ill.
471, 102 N.E. 823, 824; Gordon v. Cadwalader, 164
Cal. 509, 130 P. 18, 19; McHatton's Estate v.
Peale's Estate, Tex.Civ.App., 248 S.W. 103, 105.
This rule is expressed by Chancellor Kent as follows :
"Where a person takes an estate of freehold, legally or
equitably, under a deed, will, or other writing, and in the
same instrument there is a limitation by way of remain-
der, either with or without the interposition of another
estate, of any interest of the same legal or equitable quality
to his heirs, or heirs of his body, as a class of persons to
take in succession from generation to generation, the limi-
tation to the heirs entitles the ancestor to the whole es-
tate." In re Thorne's Estate, 344 Pa. 503, 25 A.2d 811, 819.
Intimately connected with the quantity of estate which
reported by Lord Coke in 1 Coke, 93b (23 Eliz. in C.B.).
This rule was not first laid down or established in that
case, but was then simply admitted in argument as a well-
founded and settled rule of law, and has always since been
quoted as the "Rule in Shelley's Case." Wharton. The
rule was adopted as a part of the common law of this
country, and in many of the states still prevails. It has
been abolished in most of them.

## SHELTER

In a statute relating to the provision
of food, clothing, and shelter for one's children, a

American Law
The chief executive and administrative officer of
a county, being chosen by popular election. His
principal duties are in aid of the criminal courts
and civil courts of record; such as serving
process summoning juries, executing judgments,
,
holding judicial sales and the like. He is also the
chief conservator of the peace within his terri-
torial jurisdiction. Harston v. Langston, Tex.Civ.

being the deputy of the earl or comes, to whom
anciently the custody of the shire was committed.
The duties of the sheriff principally consist in
executing writs, precepts, warrants from justices
of the peace for the apprehension of offenders,
etc. Brown.
Scotch Law
The office of sheriff differs somewhat from the
same office under the English law, being, from
ancient times, an office of important judicial pow-
er, as well as ministerial. The sheriff exercises
a jurisdiction of considerable extent, both of civil
and criminal character, which is, in a proper
sense, judicial, in addition to powers resembling
those of an English sheriff. Tomlins; Bell,
General
Deputy sheriff. See Deputy.
High sheriff. One holding the office of sheriff,
as distinguished from his deputies or assistants
or under sheriffs.

county of Middlesex is that wherein damages are
assessed in proper cases after trial at Westmins-
ter. Brown.

## SHERIFF'S COURT IN LONDON

A tribunal
having cognizance of personal actions under the
London (city) Small Debts Act of 1852. See 3
Steph.Comm., 11th ed. 30, n., 301, 449, note (1) ;
3 Bla.Comm. 80, note (j).
The "Sheriffs Court of the City of London" was the
name by which the City of London Court was known
prior to the County Courts Act, 1867, 30 & 31 Vict. c. 142,
§ 35. Its procedure was, theretofore, regulated by Acts
and Rules peculiar to itself ; but by the above enactment,
re-enacted by section 185 of the County Courts Act, 1888,
it becomes to all intents and purposes a county court.
Wharton.

## SHERIFF'S TOURN

A court of record in Eng-
land, formerly held twice every year, within a
month after Easter and Michaelmas, before the
sheriff, in different parts of the county. It was,
indeed, only the turn or rotation of the sheriff to
keep a court-leet in each respective hundred.
This was the great court-leet of the county, as
the county court is the court-baron; for out of
this, for the ease of the sheriff, was taken the
court-leet or view of frank-pledge. 4 Bl.Comm.
273. It was obsolete in Coke's time, but was
not abolished till 1887. It had a limited criminal
jurisdiction.
SHERIFFALTY, or SHRIEVALTY. The time of
a man's being sheriff. Cowell. The term of a

is usually a shewer on behalf of each party.
Archb.Pr. 339, et seq.

## SHEWING

## SHIFT MARRIAGE

When a man died having
debts which his widow was unable to pay, she
was obliged, if she contracted a second marriage,
to leave her clothes in the hands of the creditors,
and to go through the ceremony in her shift.
Gradually, however, the ceremony was mitigated
by the bridegroom lending her clothes for the oc-
casion. Said by Lecky, Hist. of Eng. 18th Cent.,
IV, p. 23, to be a curious relic of a standard of
commercial integrity which had long since passed
away.

## SHIFTING

Changing; varying; passing from
one person to another by substitution.

## SHIFTING CLAUSE

In a settlement, a clause
by which some other mode of devolution is substi-

dation of a second family, in the event of the eld-
er branch becoming otherwise enriched. These
shifting clauses take effect under the statute of
uses. Sweet.

Nautical men apply the term "ship" to distinguish a
vessel having three masts, each consisting of a lower mast,
a topmast, and a topgallant mast, with their appropriate
rigging. In familiar language, it is usually employed to
distinguish any large vessel, however rigged. Tomlins;
Cope v. Vallette Dry-Dock Co., 119 U.S. 625, 7 S.Ct. 336, 30
L.Ed. 501; Swan v. U. S., 19 Ct.C1. 62; The St. Louis,

stricted to any particular ship, and by the usage
of merchants simply denote that the property in
the goods shall pass to the buyer upon their leav-
ing the ship's tackle, and that he shall be liable
for all subsequent charges of landing. They do
not constitute a condition of the contract but are
inserted for the benefit of the seller. Harrison
v. Fortlage, 16 S.Ct. 488, 161 U.S. 57, 40 L.Ed.
Where a ship is not chartered wholly to one per-
son, but the owner offers her generally to carry
the goods of all comers, or where, if chartered to
one person, he offers her to several subfreighters
for the conveyance of their goods, she is called a
"general" ship, as opposed to a "chartered" one.
Brown. One which is employed by the charterer
or owner on a particular voyage, and is hired to

such as the certificate of registry, license, charter-
party, bills of lading and of health, required by
the law of England to be on board all British
ships. These required by the law of nations to be
on board neutral ships, to vindicate their title
to that character; these are the pass port, sea-
brief, or sea-letter, proofs of property, the muster-
roll or role d'equipage, the charter-party, the bills
of lading and invoices, the log-book or ship's jour-
nal, and the bill of health. 1 March. Ins. c. 9, §
6. See, also, Grace v. Browne, C.C.A.N.Y., 86 F.

## SHIPMENT

The delivery of the goods within
the time required on some vessel, destined to the
particular port, which the seller has reason to
suppose will sail within a reasonable time. It
does not mean a clearance of the vessel as well
as putting the goods on board where there is
nothing to indicate that the seller was expected
to exercise any control over the clearance of the
vessel or of her subsequent management. Ledon
v. Havemeyer, 121 N.Y. 179, 24 N.E. 297, 8 L.R.A.
245. See L.R. 2 App.Cas. 455; Stubbs v. Lund,

Cabin Products Co., D.C.Minn., 291 F. 435, 438.
The delivery of goods to a carrier and his is-
suance of a bill of lading therefor. Goldenberg
v. Cutler, 189 App.Div. 489, 178 N.Y.S. 522, 523.

consists in complete delivery of goods by the shipper to the
carrier for transportation, and shipment is not made until
the shipper has parted with all control over the goods and
nothing remains to be done by him to complete delivery.
Ill. 346, 155 N.E. 343, 346.
The transportation of goods. Pennsylvania R.
Co. v. Carolina Portland Cement Co., C.C.A.S.C.,
16 F.2d 760, 761.

portation. Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Carolina Port-
land Cement Co., C.C.A.S.C., 16 F.2d 760, 761. An
order. Young v. Flickinger, 75 Cal.App. 171, 242

by the carrier. Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Kittan-
ning Iron & Steel Mfg. Co., 263 Pa. 205, 106 A.
207, 208.

## SHIPPER

A Dutch word, signifying the master
of a ship. It is mentioned in some statutes, and
is now generally called "skipper." Tomlins.
One who ships goods; one who puts goods
on board of a vessel, for carriage to another
place during her voyage and for delivery there,
by charter-party or otherwise. One who signs a
bill of lading as "shipper," unless the coVrary
appears, is presumably the consignor. New Y-ork
Cent. R. Co. v. Singer Mfg. Co., 3 N.J.M. 1137, 131
A. 111, 114.
Under federal statutes, one is a "shipper" who, although
a consignee, exercises such direct control over shipments
of commodities consigned to him by another as enables
him, by his own act, to procure for himself discriminations
in respect to transportation service. U. S. v. Metropolitan
Lumber Co., D.C.N.J., 254 F. 335, 346. Thus, a forwarder
of freight, who sends in his own name all the freight he
can over a carrier, which, in consideration of the business
thus obtained, pays him a commission or salary calculated
on the freight moneys received by the carrier from him, is
a "shipper," and the payment in form of commission or
salary or otherwise is a "rebate" or concession in viola-
tion of the Interstate Commerce Act Feb. 4, 1887, c. 104, §
6, 24 Stat. 380 (49 U.S.C.A. § 6), and Elkins Act Feb. 19,
1903, c. 708, 32 Stat. 847, § 1, as amended by Act June 29,
1906, c. 3591, 34 Stat. 587, § 2 (49 U.S.C.A. § 41). U. S. v.
Lehigh Valley R. Co., D.C.N.Y., 222 F. 685, 686.

## SHIPPER'S ORDER

In bills of lading, is well
understood and means that the title remains in
the shipper until he orders a delivery of the goods.
B. W. McMahan & Co. v. State Nat. Bank of Shaw-
nee, Tex.Civ.App., 160 S.W. 403, 404; Bennett v.
Dickinson, 106 Kan. 95, 186 P. 1005.

## SHIPPING

and duties of masters and mariners; and the
law relating to ship-brokers, ship-agents, pilots,

C.A. § 564.

## SHIPPING COMMISSIONER

An ,officer of the
United States, appointed by the several circuit
courts, within their respective jurisdictions, for
each port of entry (the same being also a port of
ocean navigation), which, in the judgment of such

supervise the engagement and discharge of sea-
men; to see that men engaged as seamen report
on board at the proper time; to facilitate the ap-
prenticing of persons to the marine service; and
other similar duties, such as may be required by
law. 46 U.S.C.A. §§ 541-549 and notes.

## SHIPWRECK

dreds—later called a county (Comitatus). 1

wound, or kill, with a missile discharged from a
weapon; and the missile meant in such cases is
the arrow, bullet, or ball, intended to be discharged
and to strike the object aimed at. A person can-
not be said to have been shot who was not hit by
bullet or ball, but only powder burned by the
weapon discharged. State v. Manuel, 153 La. 7, 95
So. 263, 264. The term generally implies the use
of firearms. Shumake v. State, 90 Fla. 133, 105

## SHOP

nell, 26 Ind. 2'67; State v. Sprague, 149 Mo. 409,
50 S.W. 901; Corn. v. Riggs, 14 Gray, Mass., 378,
77 Am.Dec. 333; Richards v. Ins. Co., 60 Mich. 426,
27 N.W. 586. There must be some structure of a
more or less permanent character. 6 B. & S.
The term is properly applied to a place of manufacture

nor to a restaurant, even though the restaurant also en-
gages in the sale of cigars, Debenham v. Short, Tex.Civ.
App., 199 S. W. 1147.
The word "shop" in its popular as well as legal meaning
is not confined to a workshop, but is a word of various sig-
nificance, and "store" and "workshop" are both included
in it and do not exhaust its meaning. A place kept and
used for the sale of goods may be rightly denominated a
"shop". Commonwealth v. Moriarty, 311 Mass. 116, 40
N.E.2d 307, 308.

## SHOP RIGHT

the invention was made and reduced to practice. Crom v.
Cement Gun Co., D.C.Del., 46 F.Supp. 403, 405.

## SHOPA

entries thereon, McWhorter v. Tyson, 203 Ala.
509, 83 So. 330, 333, nor the book and entries of
an express messenger, Rhoades v. New York Cent.
& H. R. R. R., 227 Mass. 138, 116 N.E. 244, 245.

## SHOPKEEPER

Whether a person who buys
and sells commodities as a business is a merchant
or a shopkeeper depends on the extent, and not on
the character, of his business; if his business is
large he is a "merchant," and if it is small he is
a "shopkeeper." White Mountain Fur Co. v. Town
of Whitefield, 77 N.H. 340, 91 A. 870, 871.

## SHORE

Tex. 349; Bell v. Gough, 23 N.J.L. 683.
Strictly and technically, lands adjacent to the
sea or other tidal waters; the lands adjoining nav-
igable waters, where the tide flows and reflows,
which at high tides are submerged, and at low
tides are bare. Shively v. Bowlby, 14 S.Ct. 548, 152
U.S. 1, 38 L.Ed. 331; Mather v. Chapman, 40 Conn.
400, 16 Am.Rep. 46; Axline v. Shaw, 35 Fla. 305, 17

220 Mich. 684, 190 N.W. 655, 656; Sinford v. Watts,
123 Me. 230, 122 A. 573, 574; Borax Consolidated
v. City of Los Angeles, Cal., 56 S.Ct. 23, 296
U.S. 101, 80 L.Ed. 9. And this is also true even
though the lands may lie along nonnavigable
bodies of water. Hunter v. Van Keuren, 130
Misc. 599, 224 N.Y.S. 153, 160.
Sea-shore is that space of land over which the waters of
the sea spread in the highest water, during the winter sea-
son. Civ.Code La. art. 451.
Under the civil law the "shore line" boundary of lands
adjoining navigable waters is the line marked by the high-
est tide. Dincans v. Keeran, Tex.Civ.App., 192 S.W. 603,
In connection with salvage, "shore" means the land on
which the waters have deposited things which are the sub-
ject of salvage, whether below or above ordinary high-
water mark. The Gulfport, D.C.Ala., 243 F. 676, 680.

Rem. & Bal.Code, Wash., § 6641 (Rem.Rev.Stat.
§ 7833).

## SHORT

Not long; of brief length; brief; not
coming up to a measure, standard, requirement,
or the like. Webster, Dict.
A term of common use in the stock and pro-
duce markets. To say that one is "short," in the
vernacular of the exchanges, implies only that
one has less of a commodity than may be nec-
essary to meet demands and obligations. It does
not imply that commodity cannot or will not be
supplied upon demand. Thomas v. McShan, 99
Okl. 88, 225 P. 713, 714.

## SHORT CAUSE

A cause which is not likely to
occupy a great portion of the time of the court,
and which may be entered on the list of "short
causes," upon the application of one of the parties,
and will then be heard more speedily than it would
be in its regular order. This practice obtains in
the English chancery and in some of the American
states. The time allowed for the hearing varies
in the different courts.

## SHORT ENTRY

ing on the customer's pass-book the amount of
notes deposited for collection, in such a manner

tice of trial. 1 Cr. & M. 499.

## SHORT RATE

Cancellation of insurance policy.

both parties and new policy contract, identical
with original, save for shortened term and lessen-
ed earned premium, is re-issued and substituted
for original contract. Keehn v. Hi-Grade Coal &
Fuel Co., 23 N.J.Misc. 102, 41 A.2d 525, 532.

## SHORT SALE

A contract for sale of shares of
stock which the seller does not own, or certificates
for which are not within his control, so as to be
available for delivery at the time when, under
rules of the exchange, delivery must be made.
Provost v. U. S., 46 S.Ct. 152, 153, 269 U.S. 443, 70
L.Ed. 352; Chandler v. Prince, 221 Mass. 495, 109
N.E. 374, 378. In a "short sale" the broker may
make a delivery of bonds or stock, charging the
price thereof to the customer, and the account
is carried until the customer orders the broker to
repurchase the bonds, and an adjustment is made
between the broker and customer on the difference

ing, fraudulent, or nonresident debtor, which is re-
turnable within a less number of days than an

## SHORTFORD

An old custom of the city of Ex-
eter, similar to that of gavelet in London, which
was a mode of foreclosing the right of a tenant
by the chief lord of the fee, in cases of non-pay-
ment of rent. Cowell.

## SHORTLY AFTER

In point of time, a relative
term, meaning in a short or brief time or man-
ner; soon; presently; quickly. Chittenden Coun-
ty Trust Co. v. Hurd, 93 Vt. 71, 106 A. 564, 565.

bullet that is not intended to fit the bore of a
piece; also such prejectiles collectively. Green
v. Commonwealth, 122 Va. 862, 94 S.E. 940, 941.

## SHOULD

The past tense of shall, St. Louis &
S. F. R. Co. v. Brown, 45 Old. 143, 144 P. 1075,
1080, ordinarily implying duty or obligation; Scar-
borough v. Walton, 36 Ga.App. 428, 136 S.E. 830.
Kippenbrock v. Wabash R. Co., 270 Mo. 479, 194 S.
W. 50, 51; although usually no more than an ob-
ligation of propriety or expediency, or a moral
obligation, thereby distinguishing it from "ought,"
U. S. v. Stickrath, D.C.Ohio, 242 F. 151, 153. It is
not normally synonymous with "may", Williams
v. Mt. Vernon Car Mfg. Co., 197 Ill.App. 271, 272;
Elliott v. Mayes, 196 Ill.App. 605, 606; and al-
though often interchangeable with the word
"would," Barnett v. Savannah Electric Co., 15
Ga.App. 270, 82 S.E. 910, 911, it does not ordinarily
express certainty as "will" sometimes does. Hub-
bard v. Turner Department Store Co., 220 Mo.App.
95, 278 S.W. 1060, 1061.

## SHOW

## SHOW

To make apparent or clear by evi-
dence; to prove. Coyle v. Com., 104 Pa. 133. It
may be equivalent to the words "reasonably sat-
isfy," Birmingham Ry., Light & Power Co. v. Co-
hill, 196 Ala. 278, 72 So. 126, but is not synony-
mous with "state"; Chapin v. State, 107 Tex.Cr.
R. 477, 296 S.W. 1095, 1099; Chumbley v. Courtney,
181 Iowa, 482, 164 N.W. 945, 946.
Although the words "show" and "indicate" are some-
times interchangeable in popular use, they are not always
so. To "show" is to make apparent or clear by evidence,
to prove; while an "Indication" may be merely a symp-
tom; that which points to or gives direction to the mind.
Coyle v. Corn., 104 Pa. 133. "Show" means to point out, or
make known by evidence. Commonwealth v. Delfino, 259
Pa. 272, 102 A. 949, 952.

## SHOW CAUSE

Against a rule nisi, an order,
decree, execution, etc., is to appear as directed,
be confirmed, take effect, be executed, or as the

cific objects to be noted. Snyder v. Mass., 54 S.Ct.

## SHRUB

supporting trunk, or stem. Clay v. Tel. Cable Co.,
70 Miss. 406, 11 So. 658.

## SHUT DOWN

To stop work;—usually said of a
factory, etc. Webster, Dict.
Thus, within the meaning of an insurance policy, a saw
mill which has stopped running for the winter is shut
down, though men are employed about the premises and
the machinery has not been dismantled. McKenzie v. Ins.
Co., 112 Cal. 548, 44 P. 922.

## SHY

To start suddenly aside through fright or
suspicion; said especially of horses. San Antonio
Machine & Supply Co. v. McKinley, Tex.Civ.App.,
239 S.W. 340, 342.

## SHYSTER

A trickish knave; one who carries
on any business, especially a legal business, in a
dishonest way. Gribble v. Press Co., 34 Minn. 343,
25 N.W. 710; Nolan v. Standard Pub. Co., 67 Mont.
212, 216 P. 571, 574. An unscrupulous practitioner
who disgraces his profession by doing mean work,
and resorts to sharp practice to do it. Bailey v.

## SI ALIQUID EX SOLEMNIBUS DEFICIAT, CUM AEQUITAS POSCIT, SUBVENIENDUM EST

If
any one of certain required forms be wanting,
where equity requires, it will be aided. The want
of some of a neutral vessel's papers is strong pre-
sumptive evidence against the ship's neutrality,
yet the want of any one of them is not absolutely
conclusive. 1 Kent, Comm. 157.

## SI ALIQUID SAPIT

you affirm that one is ungrateful, in that you in-
clude every charge. A Roman maxim. Tray.
Lat. Max.

REGIONE IN QUA ACTUM EST FREQUENTA-
TUR. If it does not appear what was agreed up-

## SI PARET

Lat. If it appears. In Roman law.
Words used in the formula by which the praetor
appointed a judge, and instructed him how to de-

SIT VERA, SI DIVISIM, QUILIBET VEL AL-
TERI EORUM SATIS EST OBTEMPERARE; ET
IN DISJUNCTIVIS, SUFFICIT ALTERAM PAR-
TEM ESSE VERAM. If several conditions are

truth, it is necessary that every part be true, tak-
en jointly; if the conditions are separate, it is
sufficient to comply with either one or other of
them; and being disjunctive, that one or the
other be true. Co.Litt. 225.
SI PLURES SINT FIDEJUSSORES, QUOTQUOT

App. 310, 246 P. 339, 340; contra, Poole v. Imper-
ial Mut. Life & Health Ins. Co., 188 N.C. 468, 125
S.E. 8. See, also, Beaudoin v. La Societe St. Jean
Baptiste de Bienfaisance de Biddeford, 116 Me. 428,
102 A. 234, 235, L.R.A.1918B, 641, limiting the term
to those disabilities which are the natural results
of disease arising from a pathological condition,
and Northwestern Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Wiggins,
C.C.A.Or., 15 F.2d 646, 648, defining sickness as a
Illness; an ailment of such a character as to
affect the general soundness and health; not a
mere temporary indisposition, which does not tend
to undermine and weaken the constitution. Na-
tional Live Stock Ins. Co. v. Bartlow, 60 Ind.App.
233, 110 N.E. 224, 225.
In construing a sickness indemnity policy, there may be
said to be three degrees of sickness : First, when the pa-
tient is confined to his bed; second, when he is confined
to the house, but not to his bed; and, third, when he is
too sick to work, but not confined to the house. Rocci v.

law.

## SIDDI

In the Orient, a name for marihuana.
See Mariguana.

## SIDE

The margin, edge, verge, or border of a
surface; any one of the bounding lines of the
surface. Parkman v. Freeman, 121 Me. 341, 117
A. 301, 302.
"Side" may be used in a generic sense so as to include
the "front," but it also has a specific meaning which dis-
tinguishes it from "front." The word "front" as applied
to a house is always specific and speaking of the "side
line" of a house as "fronting" toward the street is incor-
rect. Howland v. Andrus, 81 N.J.Eq. 175, 86 A. 391, 393.
The front of a lot is that portion opposite the rear of the
lot and facing on the street, and the side is that portion
adjacent to the lot or lots on either side of it. Turney v.
Shriver, 269 Ill. 164, 109 N.E. 708, 709.
The party or parties collectively to a lawsuit
considered in relation to his or their opponents,
i. e., the plaintiff side, or the defendant side.
Carr v. Davis, 159 Minn. 485, 199 N.W. 237, 239.
A province or field of jurisdiction;—said of
courts. Thus, the same court is sometimes said to
have different sides. An admiralty court may
have an "instance side," distinct from its powers
as a prize court; the "crown side," (criminal ju-
risdiction) is to be distinguished from the "plea
side," (civil jurisdiction; ) the same court may
have an "equity side" and a "law side."
SIDE-BAR RULES. In English practice. There
are some rules which the courts authorize their
officers to grant as a matter of course without
formal application being made to them in open
court, and these are technically termed "side-bar
rules," because formerly they were moved for by
the attorneys at the side bar in court; such, for
instance, was the rule to plead, which was an or-
der or command of the court requiring a defend-
ant to plead within a specified number of days.
Such also were the rules to reply, to rejoin, and
many others, the granting of which depended up-
on settled rules of practice rather than upon the
discretion of the courts, all of which have been
rendered unnecessary by statutory changes.

## SIDE-KICKER

A coined expression without any
standing in lexicology, which the court, as a mat-
ter of common knowledge, can say is not an un-
common vernacular or colloquial expression which
may with equal propriety express a social rela-
tionship between the parties to whom it is applied,
or convey the idea that they are business part-
ners or have business interests in common.
Spoon v. Sheldon, 27 Cal.App. 765, 151 P. 150, 152.

## SIDE LINES

In commercial usage, lines of
goods sold or businesses followed in addition to
one's principal articles or occupation. Merrimac
Mfg. Co. v. Bibb, 124 Ark. 189, 186 S.W. 817, Ann.
Cas.1918C, 951. In mining law, the side lines of
a mining claim are those which measure the ex-
tent of the claim on each side of the middle of the
vein at the surface. They are not necessarily the
side lines as laid down on the ground or on a map
or plat; for if the claim, in its longer dimension,
crosses the vein, instead of following it, the plat-
ted side lines will be treated in law as the end
lines, and vice versa. Argentine Min. Co. v. Ter-
rible Min. Co., 7 S.Ct. 1356, 122 U.S. 478, 30 L.Ed.
1140; Del Monte Min. Co. v. Last Chance Min.
Co., 18 S.Ct. 895, 171 U.S. 55, 43 L.Ed. 72.

## SIDE REPORTS

A term sometimes applied to
unofficial volumes or series of reports, as con-
trasted with those prepared by the official report-
er of the court, or to collections of cases omitted
from the official reports.

## SIDESMEN

In ecclesiastical law. These were
originally persons whom, in the ancient episcopal
synods, the bishops were wont to summon out of
each parish to give information of the disorders
of the clergy and people, and to report heretics.
In process of time they became standing officers,
under the title of "synodsmen," "sidesmen," or
"questmen." The whole of their duties seems now
to have devolved by custom upon the church-war-
dens of a parish. 1 Burn. Ecc.Law, 399.

## SIDEWALK

That part of a public street or high-
way designed for the use of pedestrians, City of
Birmingham v. Shirley, 209 Ala. 305, 96 So. 214,
215; being exclusively reserved for them, and
constructed somewhat differently than other por-
tions of the street used by animals and vehicles
generally, Central Life Assur. Soc. of the United
States v. City of Des Moines, 185 Iowa 573, 171
N.W. 31, 32. That part of the street of a munici-
pality which has been set apart and used for ped-
estrians, as distinguished from that portion set
apart and used for animals and vehicles. Graham.
v. Albert Lea, 48 Minn. 201, 50 N.W. 1108; McCor-
mick v. Allegheny County, 263 Pa. 146, 106 A.
203, 204. A way for foot passengers, or a public
way especially intended for pedestrians. Russo v.
City of Pueblo, 63 Colo. 519, 168 P. 649, 650. A
walk for foot passengers at the side of a street
or road. Kohlhof v. Chicago, 192 Ill. 249, 61 N.E.
446, 85 Am.St.Rep. 335; Challiss v. Parker, 11 Kan.
391; State v. Berdetta, 73 Ind. 185, 38 Am.Rep. 117;
Pequignot v. Detroit, C.C.Mich., 16 F. 212.
Generally the sidewalk is included with the gutters and
roadway in the general term street. In re Burmeister, 76
v. Hoss, 114 Ind. 371, 16 N.E. 800. But in many cases of
municipal ordinances and contracts the word street is held
not to include sidewalks. Barry v. City of Cloverport, 175
Ky. 548, 194 S. W. 818, 819. See, also, James v. City of
Newberg, 101 Or. 616, 201 P. 212.

Presentment. Bills of exchange are frequently
drawn payable at sight or certain number of days
or months after sight.
When a bill of exchange is expressed to be payable "at
sight," it means on presentment to the drawee. Campbell
v. French, 6 Term, 212.
After sight in a bill means after acceptance; in a note,
after exhibition to the maker. Dan.Neg.Instr. § 619. A
bill drawn payable a certain number of days after sight,
acceptance waived, must be presented to fix the time at
which the bill is to become due, and the term of the bill
begins to run from the date of present. 4 Montreal L.
Rep. 249.

without an impression is not a seal. 3 Inst. 169.

## SIGLA

Lat. In Roman law. Marks or signs
of abbreviation used in writing. Cod. 1, 17, 11,
SIGN. To affix one's name to a writing or in-
strument, for the purpose of authenticating it, or
to give it effect as one's act. McCall v. Textile
Industrial Institute, 189 N.C. 775, 128 S.E. 349, 353.

ing a name on paper. In re Covington Lumber
Co., D.C.Wash., 225 F. 444, 446. To affix a signa-
ture to; to ratify by hand or seal; to subscribe in

Am.St.Rep. 798; In re Manchester's Estate, 174
Cal. 417, 163 P. 358, 359, L.R.A.1917D, 629, Ann.Cas.

P.2d 704, 712. See, also, Pugh v. Jackson, 154 Ky.
772, 159 S.W. 600; and In re Kimmel's Estate, 278
Pa. 435, 123 A. 405, 406, 31 A.L.R. 678, with which
compare In re Brennan's Estate, 244 Pa. 574, 91 A.
220, 222. See Signature.
To "sign" is merely to write one's name on paper, or
declare assent or attestation by some sign or mark, and
does not, like "subscribe," require that one should write
at the bottom of the instrument signed. Sheehan v. Kear-
ney, 82 Miss. 688, 21 So. 41, 35 L.R.A. 102; Robins v. Cor-
yell, 27 Barb., N.Y., 560; James v. Patten, 6 N.Y. 9, 55
Am. Dec. 376; In re Phelan's Estate, 82 N.J.Eq. 316, 87 A.
625, 626. But compare in re Manchester's Estate, 174 Cal.
417, 163 P. 358, 359, L.R.A.1917D, 629, Ann.Cas.1918B, 227.
The word "subscribed" is more restricted than the word
"signature." The word "signature" in its origin involves
merely a sign, the word "subscribed" involves a writing.
The signing of a written instrument has a much broader
and more extended meaning than attaching one's written
signature to it implies. When a person attaches his name
or causes it to be attached to a writing by any of the
known methods of impressing his name upon paper with
the intention of signing it he is regarded as having
"signed" in writing. Hagen v. Gresby, 34 N.D. 349, 159
N.W. 3, 5, L.R.A.1917B, 281.
Signing Judgment
In English practice. The signature or allow-
ance of the proper officer of a court, obtained by
the party entitled to judgment in an action, ex-
pressing generally that judgment is given in his
favor, and which stands in the place of its actual
delivery by the judges themselves. Steph.P1. 110,
111; French v. Pease, 10 Kan. 54. In American
practice. A signing of the judgment record it-
self, which is done by the proper officer, on the
margin of the record, opposite the entry of the
judgment. 1 Burrill, Pr. 268.

## SIGN MANUAL

An autograph signature; spe-
cifically, the official signature of a sovereign, chief
magistrate, or the like, to an official document, as
letters patent, to give validity. Webster, Diet.;
Wharton, Law Diet.
English Law
The signature of the king to grants or letters
patent, inscribed at the top. 2 Sharsw. Bla.Comm.
347*. The sign manual is not good unless coun-
tersigned, etc.; 9 Mod. 54. There is this differ-
ence between what the sovereign does under the
sign manual and what he or she does under the
great seal, viz., that the former is done as a per-
sonal act of the sovereign; the latter as an act
of state. Brown.

## SIGNA

The plural of signum (q. v.).

## SIGNAL

A means of communication, as be-
tween vessels at sea or between a vessel and the
shore. The international code of signals for the
use of all nations assigns arbitrary meanings to

law. A signet-ring; a seal-ring. Dig. 50, 16, 74.

## SIGNATORY

SIGNATURE. The act of putting down a man's
name at the end of an instrument to attest its va-
lidity, the name thus written. A "signature" may
be written by hand, printed, stamped, typewritten,
engraved, photographed, or cut from one instru-
ment and attached to another, and a signature
lithographed on an instrument by a party is suf-
ficient for the purpose of signing it; it being im-
material with what kind of instrument a signa-
ture is made. Smith v. Greenville County, 188
S.C. 349, 199 S.E. 416, 419. Maricopa County v.
Osborn, 60 Ariz. 290, 136 P.2d 270, 274. And what-
ever mark, symbol, or device one may choose to
employ as representative of himself is sufficient.
Griffith v. Bonawitz, 73 Neb. 622, 103 N.W. 327,
339. See Sign.
Ecclesiastical Law
The name of a sort of rescript, without seal,
containing the supplication, the signature of the
pope or his delegate, and the grant of a pardon.
Where one who cannot write directs another to sign for
him in his presence, it will be valid with or without a
mark. Just v. Wise Tp., 42 Mich. 573, 4 N.W. 298.
The "signature" to a deed may be made either by the
grantor affixing his own signature, or by adopting one writ-
ten for him, or by making his mark, or impressing some
other sign or symbol on the paper by which the signature,
though written by another for him, may be identified. Lee
v. Parker, 171 N.C. 144, 88 S.E. 217, 221.

## SIGNIFICAVIT

In ecclesiastical law. When
this word is used alone, it means the bishop's cer-
tificate to the court of chancery in order to obtain
the writ of excommunication; but, where the
words "writ of significavit" are used, the mean-
ing is the same as "writ de excommunicato capi-
endo." Shelf. Mar. & Div. 502. Obsolete.

## SIGNIFY

To make known by signs or words;
express; communicate; announce; declare. State
v. Klein, 94 Wash. 212, 162 P. 52, 53.

ment. Calvin.
A species of proof. By "signa" were meant
those species of indicia which come more immedi-
ately under the cognizance of the senses; such as
stains of blood on the person of one accused of
murder, indications of terror at being charged
with the offense, and the like. Best, Pres. 13,
note f.

SILENCE. The state of a person who does not
speak, or of one who refrains from speaking. In

An agreement inferred from silence rests upon principle
of "estoppel." Letres v. Washington Co-op. Chick Ass'n,

Elements or essentials of such estoppel include change
of position to prejudice of person claiming estoppel, Sher-
lock v. Greaves, 106 Mont. 206, 76 P.2d 87, 91. Damages
if the estoppel is denied, James v. Nelson, C.C.A.Alaska,

the plea has the conclusion to the country, and its
effect is to join the plaintiff in the issue thus ten-
dered by the defendant. Co.Litt. 126a.
SIMILITUDO LEGALIS EST CASUUM DIVER-
SORUM INTER SE COLLATORUM SIMILIS RA-
TIO; QUOD IN UNO SIMILIUM VALET, VALE-
BIT IN ALTERO. DISSIMILIUM, DISSDIILIS
EST RATIO. Legal similarity is a similar rea-

with each other; for what avails in one similar
case will avail in the other. Of things dissimilar,
the reason is dissimilar. Co.Litt. 191; Benj.Sales

ance of another person, in an act or series of acts,

fraudulent purpose of the party to gain thereby
some advantage to which he is not entitled, or to
injure, delay, or defraud others. See Cartwright
v. Bamberger, 90 Ala. 405, 8 So. 264.

It may at any time and at the demand of any

is not entitled, or of defrauding or delaying third
persons.

## SIMULATED SALE

One which has all the ap-
pearance of an actual sale in good faith, intended

intended to be paid, and such sale has no legal
effect and no title is transferred thereby. If there
exists an actual consideration for transfer evi-
denced by alleged act of sale, no matter how inade-
quate it be, the transaction is not a "simulated
sale", and, even though it be charged to be in
fraud of vendor's creditors, such transfer cannot
be set aside as a simulation although it may be
subject to annulment on the ground of fraud or
the giving of undue preference. Caster v. Miller,
D.C.La., 39 F.Supp. 120, 123.

## SIMULATIO LATENS

tacked collaterally by any interested person.
Freeman v. Woods, La.App., 1 So.2d 134, 136.
In French law, Collusion; a fraudulent ar-

ern Electric Co., C.C.I11., 69 F. 240, 244.

house Mach. Co. v. C. & G. Cooper Co., C.C.A.Ohio, 245 F.

order of things should be observed. And there-
fore sinderesis is called by some men the 'law of
reason,' for it ministereth the principles of the law
of reason, the which be in every man by nature, in
that he is a reasonable creature," Doct. & Stud.

other than person slandered, and publication is
always material and issuable fact in action for
slander. Tucker v. Pure Oil Co. of Carolinas, 191
S.C. 60, 3 S.E.2d 547, 549. Hence an oral defama-
tion, heard only by one who does not understand
the language in which it is spoken, is not "slan-
der". Allen v. American Indemnity Co., 63 Ga.
App. 894, 12 S.E.2d 127, 128.

Allison v. Berry, 316 Ill.App. 261, 44 N.E.2d 929, 934.

## SOCAGE

A species of tenure, in England, where-
of certain inferior services of husbandry to be
performed by him to the lord of the fee. In its
most general and extensive signification, a ten-
ure by any certain and determinate service. And
in this sense it is by the ancient writers constant-
ly put in opposition to tenure by chivalry or
knight-service, where the render was precarious
and uncertain. Socage is of two sorts,—free so-
cage, where the services are not only certain, but
honorable; and villein socage, where the services,
though certain, are of baser nature. Such as hold
by the former tenure are also called in Glanvil
and other authors by the name of "liberi sokeman-
ni," or tenants in free socage. By the statute 12
Car. 2, c. 24, all the tenures by knight-service
were, with one or two immaterial exceptions,
converted into free and common socage. Cowell;
Bract. 1. 2, c. 35; 2 B1.Comm. 79; Flata, lib. 3,

17 F.Supp. 201, 205.
SOCIAL CONTRACT, or COMPACT. In political
philosophy, a term applied to the theory of the
origin of society associated chiefly with the names
of Hobbes, Locke and Rousseau, though it can be
traced back to the Greek Sophists. Rousseau
(Contract Social) held that in the pre-social state
man was unwarlike and timid. Laws resulted
from the combination of men who agreed, for
mutual protection, to surrender individual free-
dom of action. Government must therefore rest
on the consent of the governed. Encycl. Br.

## SOCIAL INSURANCE

ferred to under the head: Unemployment, old
age pensions, mothers' and orphans' pensions,
sickness, etc. Smythe v. Home Life & Accident

## SOCIAL SETTLEMENT

The term as applied
to organizations engaged in charitable or philan-
thropic work, implies a fixed locality to be bene-
fited by supplying moral, physical, and educa-
tional help to the poor and needy. In re Young
Women's Christian Ass'n, Sup., 141 N.Y.S. 260,
SOCIALISM. Any theory or system of social or-
ganization which would abolish, entirely or in
great part, the individual effort and competition
on which modern society rests, and substitute for
perfect and equal distribution of the products
of labor, and would make land and capital, as
the instruments and means of production, the
joint possession of the members of the commu-
nity.

## SOCIDA

## SOCIEDAD

In Spanish law. Partnership.
Schm. Civil Law, 153, 154.

## SOCIEDAD ANONIMA

In Spanish and Mexican
law. A business corporation. "By the corporate
name, the shareholders' names are unknown to
the world; and, so far as their connection with
the yorporationis concerned, their own names
may be said to be anonymous, that is, nameless.
Hence the derivation of the term 'anonymous' as
applied to a body of persons associated together
in the form of a company to transact any given
business under a company name which does not
disclose any of their own." Hall, Mex. Law, §
SOCIEDAD DE GANANCIALES. A Cuban law.
It exists between husband and wife and is literal-
ly an association for profit. The underlying pur-
pose of such associations is that the spouses may
each contribute to a common stock, the wife her
dowry, the husband his capital, the gains from
those as well as from their joint labors, to be
shared equally. On dissolution of the associa-
tion, ordinarily by death, the distribution is as
follows: First the wife gets back her dowry and
"parapherna"; second, the debts of the "sociedad"
are paid; and the husband's contribution, "capi-
tal," is returned. The remainder is profits, "gan-
anciales," and is divided equally between the
spouses after restoring any losses to their con-
tributed property. Sanchez v. Bowers, C.C.A.N.Y.,
70 F.2d 715, 716, 718.

the members; the others were strictly secret part-
ners. To creditors of the firm they came into no
relation and under no liability. An association
where the liability of all the partners is limited. It
had in England until lately no other name than
that of "chartered company," meaning thereby a
joint-stock company whose shareholders, by a
charter from the crown, or a special enactment of
the legislature, stood exempted from any liabil-
ity for the debts of the concern, beyond the
amount ,of their subscriptions. 2 Mill, Pol. Econ.

L.Ed. 734.

## SODOMY

A carnal copulation by human beings
with each other against nature, or with a beast.
Strum v. State, 168 Ark. 1012, 272 S.W. 359. State
v. Young, 140 Or. 228, 13 P.2d 604, 607.
This term is often defined in statutes and judicial deci-
sions as meaning "the crime against nature," the "crimen
innominatum," or as carnal copulation, against the order
of nature, by man with man, or, in the same unnatural
manner, with woman or with a beast. See Code Ga.1882,
§ 4352 (Penn.Code 1910, § 373) ; Honselman v. People, 168
111. 172, 48 N.E. 304. But, strictly speaking, it should be
used only as equivalent to "pederasty," that is, the sexual
act as performed by a man upon the person of another
man or a boy by penetration of the anus. See Ausman v.
Veal, 10 Ind. 355, 71 Am.Dec. 331. The term might also,
without any great violence to its original meaning, be so
extended as to cover the same act when performed in the
same manner by a man upon the person of a woman. An-
other possible method of unilateral sexual connection, by
penetration of the mouth (penem in orem alii immittere,
vel penem alii in orem recipere) is not properly called
"sodomy," but "fellation." That this does not constitute
sodomy within the meaning of a statute is held in Com. v.
Poindexter, Ky., 118 S.W. 943; Lewis v. State, 36 Tex.
Cr.R. 37, 35 S.W. 372, 61 Am.St.Rep. 831; but a greater
number of jurisdictions hold otherwise. See State v. Far-
ris, 189 Iowa, 505, 178 N.W. 361, 362 ; Glover v. State, 179
Ind. 459, 101 N.E. 629, 630, L.R.A.,N.S., 473; White v.
State, 136 Ga. 158. 71 S.E. 135; State v. Start, 65 Or. 178,
132 P. 512, 46 L.R.A.,N.S., 266. On the other hand besti-
ality is the carnal copulation of a human being with a
brute, or animal of the sub-human orders of the opposite
sex. It is not identical with sodomy, nor is it a form of
sodomy, though the two terms are often confused in legal
writings and sometimes in statutes. See Ausman v. Veal,
10 Ind. 355, 71 Am.Dec. 331. Buggery is a term rarely used
in statutes, but apparently including both sodomy (in the
widest sense) and bestiality as above defined. See Ausman
v. Veal, 10 Ind. 355, 71 Am.Dec. 331; Com. v. J., 21 Pa.Co.
et. R. 625.

## SOIL

surface.

even though he did not do so and his acts were
for his personal benefit, possibly through defalca-
tion, the third party who obligated himself must
have been under the impression that he was deal-
ing with the principal. General American Life
Ins. Co. v. Anderson, D.C.Ky., 46 F.Supp. 189, 195,
196, 198. It is based on the presumption that by
reason of the relationship between an agent and
his principal the principal is presumed to have
been told everything the agent has "done and pre-
sumed to have known of his actions and promises.

common law, a solicitor, a practitioner in the
courts of equity. Most attorneys take out a cer-
tificate to practice in the courts of chancery, and
therefore become solicitors also, and, on the other
hand, most, if not all, solicitors take out a certifi-
cate to practice in the courts of common law, and

## SOLIDARITY

same sum, at the same time, and in the same con-
tract; and so obligate themselves that -each may
be compelled to pay the whole debt, and that pay-
ment made by one of them exonerates the others
towards the creditor; and the obligation thus con-
tracted is one, in solido, although one of the debt-
ors be obliged differently from the others to the
payment of one and the same thing; as if the
one be but conditionally bound, while the engage-
ment of the others is pure and simple, or if the
one is allowed a term which is not granted to the
others. Rex Credit Co. v. Long, La.App., 159 So.
359, 360.

## SOLIDARY

A term of civil-law origin, signify-
ing that the right or interest spoken of is joint or
common. A "solidary obligation" corresponds to
a "joint and several" obligation in the common
law; that is, one for which several debtors are
bound in such wise that each is liable for the en-
tire amount, and not merely for his proportionate
share. But in the civil law the term also includes
the case where there are several creditors, as
against a common debtor, each of whom is en-
titled to receive the entire debt and give an ac-
quittance for it.

## SOLIDUM

Lat. In the civil law. A whole; an
entire or undivided thing.

## SOLIDUS LEGALIS

iginally the "solidus" was a gold coin of the By-
zantine Empire, but in medieval times the term
was applied to several varieties of coins, or as
descriptive of a money of account, and is supposed
to be the root from which "shilling" is derived.

## SOLITARY CONFINEMENT

## SOLUM PROVINCIALE

Lat. In Roman law.
The solum italicum (an extension of the old Ager
Romanus) admitted full ownership, and of the
application to it of usucapio; whereas the solum
provinciale (an extension of the old Ager Publi-

longi temporis possessio only. Justinian abolish-
ed all distinctions between the two, sinking the
italicum to the level of the provinciale. Brown.

## SOLUM REX HOC NON FACERE POTEST, QUOD NON POTEST INJUSTE AGERE

## SOLUTIO

## SOLUTIO INDEBITI

In the civil law. Payment
of what was not due. From the payment of what
was not due arises an obligation quasi ex con-
tractu. When one has erroneously given or per-
formed something to or for another, for which he
was in no wise bound, he may redemand it, as
if he had only lent it. The term "solutio indebiti"
is here used in a very wide sense, and includes
also the case where one performed labor for an-
other, or assumed to pay a debt for which he was
not bound, or relinquished a right or released a
debt, under the impression that he was legally
bound to do so. Mackeld. Rom. Law, § 500.

British empire.) Brown. In the intercourse of
nations, certain states have a position of entire
independence of others, and can perform all those
acts which it is possible for any state to perform
in this particular sphere. These same states have
also entire power of self-government; that is, of
independence upon all other states as far as their
own territory and citizens not living abroad are
concerned. -No foreign power or law can have
control except by convention. This power of in-
dependent action in external and internal rela-
tions constitutes complete sovereignty. Wools.
Pol. Science, I. 204.

## SOVEREIGNTY

The supreme, absolute, and un-
controllable power by which any independent
state is governed; supreme political authority;
paramount control of the constitution and frame
of government and its administration; the self-
sufficient source of political power, from which
all specific political powers are derived; the in-
ternational independence of a state, combined
with the right and power of regulating its internal
affairs without foreign dictation; also a political
society, or state, which is sovereign and independ-
ent. Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 455, 1 L.Ed. 440;
Union Bank v. Hill, 3 Cold., Tenn., 325; Moore
v. Shaw, 17 Cal. 218, 79 Am.Dec. 123; State v.
Dixon, 66 Mont. 76, 213 P. 227.
The power to do everything in a state without
accountability,—to make laws, to execute and to
apply them, to impose and collect taxes and levy
contributions, to make war or peace, to form
treaties of alliance or of commerce with foreign
nations, and the like. Story, Const. § 207.
"Sovereignty" in government is that public authority
which directs or orders what is to be done by each mem-
ber associated in relation to the end of the association. It
is the supreme power by which any citizen is governed and
is the person or body of persons in the state to whom there
is politically no superior. The necessary existence of the
state and that right and power which necessarily follow is
"sovereignty." By "sovereignty" in its largest sense is
lute right to govern. The word which by itself comes
nearest to being the definition of "sovereignty" is will or
volition as applied to political affairs. City of Bisbee v.
Cochise County, 52 Ariz. 1, 78 P.2d 982, 986.

## SOVERTIE

In old Scotch law. Surety. Skene.

## SOWLEGROVE

Wales. Cowell.

## SOWMING AND ROWMING

Terms used to express the form by which the
number of cattle brought upon a common by
those having a servitude of pasturage may be
justly proportioned to the rights of the different
persons possessed of the servitude. Beli.

## SOWNE

In old English law. To be leviable.
An old exchequer term applied to sheriff's re-
turns. 4 Inst. 101; Cowell; Spelman.

## SPADARIUS

Lat. A sword-bearer. Blount.

## SPADONES

Lat. In the civil law. Impotent
persons. Those who, on account of their tempera-
ment or some accident they have suffered, are
unable to procreate. Inst. 1, 11, 9; Dig. 1, 7, 2, 1.

## SPARSDI

Lat. Here and there; scattered; at
intervals. For instance, trespass to realty by

## SPEAK

In practice. To argue. "The case was
ordered to be spoke to again." 10 Mod. 107. See
Imparlance; Speaking with Prosecutor.

## SPEAKER

The official designation of the presi-
dent or chairman of certain legislative bodies,
particularly of the house of representatives in
the congress of the United States, of one or both
branches of several of the state legislatures, and
of the two houses of the British parliament.
The term "speaker," as used in reference to
oither of the houses of parliament, signifies the
functionary acting as chairman. In the com-
mons his duties are to put questions, to preserve
order, and to see that the privileges of the house
are not infringed; and, in the event of the num-
bers being even on a division, he has the privi-
lege of giving the casting vote. The speaker of
the lords is the lord chancellor or the lord keeper
of the great seal of England, or, if he be absent,
the lords may choose their own speaker. The du-
ties of the speaker of the lords are principally
confined to putting questions, and the lord chan-
cellor has no more to do with preserving order
than any other peer. Brown.

## SPEAKING DEMURRER

See Demurrer.

## SPEAKING ORDER

See Order.

## SPEAKING WITH PROSECUTOR

A method of
compounding an offense, allowed in the English
practice, where the court permits a defendant
convicted of a misdemeanor to speak with the
prosecutor declares himself satisfied, the court

operates only upon particular persons or private
concerns. 1 Bl.Comm. 86; Unity v. Burrage, 103
U.S. 454, 26 L.Ed. 405.

## SPECIAL CASE

In English practice. When a
trial at nisi prius appears to the judge to turn on
a point of law, the jury may find a general ver-
dict, subject to the opinion of the court above, up-
on what is termed a "special case" to be made;
that is, upon a written statement of all the facts
of the case drawn up for the opinion of the court
in bane, by the counsel and attorneys on either
side, under correction of the judge at nisi prius.
The party for whom the general verdict is so
given is in such case not entitled to judgment
till the court in banc has decided on the special
case; and, according to the result of that deci-
sion, the verdict is ultimately entered either for
him or his adversary. Brown.

## SPECIAL CLAIM

In English law. A claim not
enumerated in the orders of April 22, 1850, which
required the leave of the court of chancery to file
it. Such claims are abolished.

## SPECIAL COMMISSION

In English law. An
extraordinary commission of oyer and terminer
and gaol delivery, issued by the crown to the
judges when it is necessary that offenses should
be immediately tried and punished. Wharton.
such as, instead of joining in error, allege some
extraneous matter as a ground of defeating the
writ of error, e. g., a release of errors, expira-
tion of the time within which error might be
brought, or the like. To these, the plaintiff in
error may either reply or demur.

## SPECIAL EXAMINER

In English law. Some
person, not one of the examiners of the court of
chancery, appointed to take evidence in a particu-
lar suit. This may be done when the state of
business in the examiner's office is such that it is
impossible to obtain an appointment at a con-
veniently early day, or when the witnesses may
be unable to come to London. Hunt. Eq. pt. I. c.
5, § 2.

## SPECIAL EXCEPTION

An objection to the
form in which a cause of action is stated. Coch-
ran v. People's Nat. Bank, Tex.Civ.App., 271 S.W.
433, 434.

## SPECIAL EXECUTION

A copy of a judgment
with a direction to the sheriff indorsed thereon
to execute it. Crombie v. Little, 47 Minn. 581, 50
N.W. 823. One that directs a levy upon some
special property. Oklahoma Salvage & Supply
Co. v. First Nat. Bank, 122 Oki. 128, 251 P. 1006,
SPECIAL EXECUTOR. One whose power and of-
fice are limited, either in respect to the time or
place of their exercise, or restricted to a particu-
lar portion of the decedent's estate.
One only empowered by will to take charge of a limited
portion of the estate, or such part as may lie in one place,
or to carry on the administration only to a prescribed
point.

## SPECIAL FACTS RULE

In corporation law, as
respects director's duty of disclosure when deal-
ing with stockholders, is that where special cir-
cumstances or facts are present which make it
inequitable for the director to withhold informa-
tion from the stockholder, the duty to disclose
arises, and concealment is fraud. Taylor v.
Wright, 69 Cal.App.2d 371, 159 P.2d 980, 985.

## SPECIAL JURISDICTION

A court authorized
to take cognizance of only some few kinds of
causes or proceedings expressly designated by
statute is called a "court of special jurisdiction."
SPECIAL LAW. One relating to particular per-
sons or things; one made for individual cases
or for particular places or districts; one operat-
ing upon a selected class, rather than upon the
public generally. State v. Irwin, 5 Nev. 120;
Sargent v. Union School Dist., 63 N.H. 528, 2 A.
641; Dodge v. Youngblood, Tex.Civ.App., 202 S.W.
116, 118; Ex parte Crane, 27 Idaho 671, 151 P.
1006, 1011, L.R.A.1918A, 942; State v. Daniel, 87
Fla. 270, 99 So. 804, 809. A law is "special" when
it is different from others of the same general
kind or designed for a particular purpose, or
limited in range or confined to a prescribed field
of action or operation. State v. Johnson, 170 N.
C. 685, 86 S.E. 788, 792,
it affects all persons in like circumstances in the same
manner. St. Louis-San Francisco Ry. Co. v. Bledsoe, C.C.
A.Okl., 7 F.2d 364, 366. Whether an act be local or special
is determined by the generality with which it affects the
people as a whole, rather than the extent of territory over
which it is operative, and, if it equally affects all people
coming within its operation, it is not local or special.
State ex rel. Garvey v. Buckner, 308 Mo. 390, 272 S.W. 940,
942. In taxation cases, courts make no distinction between
"special law" and "local law." Bozarth v. Egg Harbor
City, 85 N.J.Law, 412, 89 A. 920, 921. The phrases "spe-
cial act" and "private act" mean the same thing. Federal
Trust Co. v. East Hartford Fire Dist., C.C.A.Conn., 283 F.
95, 98

## SPECIAL LIEN

A special lien is in the nature
of a particular lien, being a lien upon particular
property; a lien which the holder can enforce
only as security for the performance of a particu-
lar act or obligation and of obligations incidental
thereto. Green v. Coast Line R. Co., 97 Ga. 15,
24 S.E. 814, 33 L.R.A. 806, 54 Am.St.Rep. 379; Civ.
Code Cal. § 2875; Marks v. Baum Bldg. Co., 73
Okl. 264, 175 P. 818, 822.

## SPECIAL MATTER

Under a plea of the gen-
eral issue, the defendant is allowed to give spe-
cial matter in evidence, usually after notice to the
plaintiff of the nature of such matter, thus spar-
ing him the necessity of pleading it specially. 3
Bl.Comm. 306.

## SPECIAL PAPER

A list kept in the English
courts of common law, and now in the king's
bench, common pleas, and exchequer divisions of
the high court, in which list demurrers, special
cases, etc., to be argued are set down. It is dis-
tinguished from the new trial paper, peremptory
paper, crown paper, revenue paper, etc., according
to the practice of the particular division. Whar-
ton.

## SPECIAL PLACE

In Negotiable Instruments.
A bank, office, or any other place of business,
house or residence, usually occupied by people for
business, social, or other purposes, without refer-
ence to its location, whether within or without a
city, town, or village as distinguished from the
city, town or village. O'Connor v. Kirby Inv. Co.,
Tex.Civ.App., 262 S.W. 554, 556; Maddock v. Mc-
Donald, 111 Or. 448, 227 P. 463, 464; Corbett v.
Ulsaker Printing Co., 49 N.D. 103, 190 N.W. 75,
76, 24 A.L.R. 1047; Harrison v. Beals, 111 Or. 563,
222 P. 728, 731; Moore v. Knemeyer, Tex.Civ.App.,
271 S.W. 653, 654.

## SPECIAL REGISTRATION

In election laws.
Registration for particular election only which
does not entitle elector to vote at any succeeding
election. Cowart v. City of Waycross, 159 Ga.
589, 126 S.E. 476, 479.

## SPECIALIA GENERALIBUS DEROGANT

Spe-
cial words derogate from general words. A spe-
cial provision as to a particular subject-matter is
to be preferred to general language, which might
have governed in the absence of such special pro-
vision. L.R. 1 C.P. 546.

## SPECIALIST

In stock exchange. Broker who
remains at one post of exchange where particular
stocks are dealt in and executes orders of other
who specializes in limited group of stocks. In re
Brown, 242 N.Y. 1, 150 N.E. 581, 585, 44 A.L.R.
510; People ex rel. Berdan v. Goldfogle, 213 App.
Div. 702, 211 N.Y.S. 107.

## SPECIALTY

A contract under seal. Furst v.
Brady, 375-Ill. 425, 31 N.E.2d 606, 609, 133 A.L.R.
A writing sealed and delivered, containing some
agreement. A writing sealed and delivered, which
is given as a security for the payment of a debt,
in which such debt is particularly specified. Bac.
Abr. "Obligation," A.
A corporate seal is not necessary to the contract of a
corporation, and hence it is generally deemed that the
affixing of a corporate seal to an instrument not required
to be executed with that formality indicates that the in-
strument was intended to be a "specialty", bat there is
an exception if it appears from the instrument itself that
the instrument was not intended to be a specialty. Caruth-
ers v. Peninsular Life Ins. Co., 150 Fla. 467, 7 So.2d 841,
SPECIALTY DEBT. A debt due or acknowledged
to be due by deed or instrument under seal. 2 Bl.
Comm. 465.

## SPECIE

Coin of the precious metals, of a cer-
tain weight and fineness, and bearing the stamp
of the government, denoting its value as currency.
Trebilcock v. Wilson, 12 Wall. 695, 20 L.Ed. 460;
Walkup v. Houston, 65 N.C. 501;. Henry v. Bank of
Salina, 5 Hill, N.Y., 536.
When spoken of a contract, the expression "per-
formance in specie" means strictly, or according
to the exact terms. As applied to things, it signi-
fies individuality or identity. Thus, on a be-
quest of a specific picture, the legatee would be
said to be entitled to the delivery of the picture in
specie; i. e., of the very thing. Whether a thing
is due in genere or in specie depends, in each case,
on the will of the transacting parties. Brown.

## SPECIES

Lat. In the civil law. Form; figure;
fashion or shape. A form or shape given to ma-
terials.

## SPECIES FACTI

In Scotch law. The particular
criminal act charged against a person.

ture. People v. Thomas, 25 Ca1.2d 880, 156 P.2d 7,
17. Having a certain form or designation; ob-
serving a certain form; particular; precise; tend-
ing to specify, or to make particular, definite, lim-
ited or precise. Republic Casualty Co. v. Scand-
inavian-American Bank, D.C.Wash., 2 F.2d 113,
114; Western Union Telegraph Co. v. South &
N. A. R. Co., 184 Ala. 66, 62 So. 788, 793.
As to specific "Denial," "Devise," "Legacy,"
and "Performance," see those titles.

## SPECIFICALLY

In a specific manner; explicit-
ly, particularly, definitely. Straton v. Hodgkins,
109 W.Va. 536, 155 S.E. 902.

## SPECIFICATIO

Lat. In the civil law. Literal-
ly, a making of form; a giving of form to mater-
which a person, by transforming a thing belong-
ing to another, especially by working up his ma-
terials into a new species, becomes proprietor of
the same. Mackeld. Rom. Law, § 271.

## SPECIFICATION

As used in the law relating
to patents, machinery and in building contracts,
a particular or detailed statement of the various
elements involved. Gilbert v. U. S., 1 Ct.C1. 34;
State v. Kendall, 15 Neb. 262, 18 N.W. 85; Wilson
v. Coon, C.C.N.Y., 6 F. 614; State Bank of Free-
port v. Cape Girardeau & C. R. Co., 172 MO.App.

Hall, 255 Mo. 675, 164 S.W. 541, 544.
Law of Personal Property
The acquisition of title to a thing by working it
into new forms or species from the raw material;
corresponding to the specificatio of the Roman
law. See Lampton v. Preston, 1 J. J. Marsh, Ky.,
462, 19 Am.Dec. 104.
Right by "specification" can only be acquired when,
without the accession of any other material that of another
person, which has been used by the operator innocently,
has been converted by him into something specifically dif-
ferent in the inherent and characteristic qualities, which
identify it. Such is the conversion of corn into meal, of
grapes into wine, etc. Bozeman Mortuary Ass'n v. Fair-
child, 253 Ky. 74, 68 S.W.2d 756, 92 A.L.R. 419.
Military Law
The clear and particular description of the
charges preferred against a person accused of a
military offense. Tytler, Mil. Law, 109; Carter v.

Valley Land Co. v. Barth, 67 Mont. 353, 215 P.
654, 655; Aleksich v. Industrial Accident Fund,
116 Mont. 127, 151 P.2d 1016, 1021.

tended to exhibit the kind and quality of the
whole. People v. Freeman, 1 Idaho 322.

## SPECULATION

Buying or selling with expecta-
tion of profiting by a rise or fall in price; also
engaging in hazardous business transactions for
the chance of unusually large profit. Clucas v.

the subject-matter involved, can be pursued with
expedition and without essential detriment to the
party aggrieved. State v. District Court of Thir-
teenth Judicial Dist. in and for Yellowstone Coun-
ty, 50 Mont. 289, 146 P. 743, 745, Ann.Cas.1917C,
SPEEDY TRIAL. In criminal law. As secured by

P. 944, 946. A trial as soon after indictment as
prosecution can with reasonable diligence pre-
pare for it. People v. Molinari, 23 Cal.App.2d
Supp. 761, 67 P.2d 767, 770.
It does not mean trial immediately after defendant's ap-
prehension and indictment, but trial consistent with court's
business. People v. Wilson, 356 Ill. 256, 190 N.E. 270, 272.

## SPELLING

The formation of words by letters;
orthography. Incorrect spelling does not vitiate
a written instrument if the intention clearly ap-
pears.

## SPEND

To consume by using in any manner, to
use up, to exhaust, distribute, as to expend money
or any other possession. Levenson v. Wolfson,
42 Ohio App. 332, 182 N.E. 116.

## SPENDTHRIFT

One who spends money pro-
fusely and improvidently; a prodigal; one who
lavishes or wastes his estate. Taylor v. Koenig-
stein, 128 Neb. 809, 260 N.W. 544.
In some jurisdictions, under statutes, a person who by
excessive drinking, gaming, idleness, or debauchery of any
kind shall so spend, waste, or lessen his estate as to expose
himself or his family to want or suffering, or expose the
town to charge or expense for the support of himself or
family. Rev.St.Maine, c. 67, § 4, cl. 2 (Rev.St.1930, c. 80, §
4, cl. 2) ; Pub. Laws N.H,1926, c. 291, § 4; G.L.Mass., c.
201, § 8; Smith-Hurd Rev.St.I11.1931, c. 86, § 53; Young v.
Young, 87 Me. 44, 22 A. 782; Morey's Appeal, 57 N.H. 54;
Norton v. Leonard, 12 Pick., Mass., 152, 161; In re Bishop,
149 Ill.App. 491, 498.
Every person who is liable to be put under guardianship
on account of excessive drinking, gaming, idleness, or de-
bauchery. Comp. Laws Mich.1929, § 15777; G.L.Vt. 3651.

## SPENDTHRIFT TRUST

A trust created to pro-
vide a fund for the maintenance of a beneficiary,
and at the same time to secure it against his im-
providence or incapacity. In re Nicholson's Es-
tate, 104 Colo. 561, 93 P.2d 880, 883. One which
provides a fund for benefit of another than settlor,
secures it against beneficiary's own improvidence,
and places it beyond his creditors' reach. Green-
wich Trust Co. v. Tyson, 129 Conn. 211, 27 A.2d
166, 171, 172. Provisions against alienation of the
trust fund by the voluntary act of the beneficiary
or by his creditors are the usual incidents. Estes
v. Estes, Tex.Civ.App., 255 S.W. 649, 650; New-
comb v. Masters, 287 Ill. 26, 122 N.E. 85, 87; Plitt
v. Yakel, 129 Md. 464, 99 A. 669, 670; Keating v.
Keating, 182 Iowa 1056, 165 N.W. 74, 79; Graham
v. More, Mo., 189 S.W. 1186, 1188; Newell v.
Tubbs, 103 Colo. 224, 84 P.2d 820, 821.
To constitute valid "spendthrift trust," legal title must
be vested in trustee; gift must be only of income to a
beneficiary, taking no estate, having no power of aliena-
tion, right to possession, nor beneficial interest in property
save qualified right to support and equitable interest in
income; and trust must be active one. Chinnis v. Cobb,
210 N.C. 104, 185 S.E. 638, 640.

debt which one may hope to recover may be called
"sperate," in opposition to "desperate." See 1
Chit. Pr. 520.

## SPES ACCRESCENDI

Lat. Hope of surviving.
3 Atk. 762; 2 Kent, Comm. 424.

single cause of action, claim, or demand into two
or more parts, and bringing suit for one of such
parts only. The plaintiff who does this is bound
by his first judgment, and can recover no more.
2 Black, Judgm. § 734. Birdville Independent
School Dist. v. Deen, Tex.Civ.App., 114 S.W.2d 628,

action. Glavich v. Industrial Accident Commission of Cali-
fornia, 44 Cal.App.2d 517, 112 P.2d 774, 778.
The rule against "splitting causes of action" does not
mean that plaintiff cannot sue for less than is his due but
means merely that if he does so he may be precluded from
maintaining another action for the remainder of the same
demand. Scientific & Hospital Supply Corporation v. Board
of Education of City of New York, 16 N.Y.S.2d 91, 93, 172
Misc. 770.
The rule against "splitting cause of action" applies only

sumption that the claim has been abandoned or

than is necessary to "laches." Bell v. Mackey, 191
S.C. 105, 3 S.E.2d 816, 824, 830. The doctrine is

iners, 192 Ga. 415, 15 S.E.2d 486, 488; Lamar v.

265 Ky. 835, 98 S.W.2d 29, 31.
Basic difference In effect between "loss payable clause"
and "standard mortgage clause" is that the former is sub-
ject to such defenses as insurer may have against the mort-

A practice by
which, on the drawing of a jury for a criminal
trial, the prosecuting officer puts aside a juror,
provisionally, until the panel is exhausted, with-
out disclosing his reasons, instead of being requir-
ed to challenge him and show cause. The statute
33 Edw. I. deprived the crown of the power to
challenge jurors without showing cause, and the
practice of standing aside jurors was adopted, in
England, as a method of evading its provisions.
A similar practice is in use in Pennsylvania. See
Warren v. Corn., 37 Pa. 54; Zell v. Com., 94 Pa.
,
272; Haines v. Corn., 100 Pa. 322. But in Missouri,
it is said that the words "stand aside" are the
usual formula, used in impaneling a jury, for re-
jecting a juror. State v. Hultz, 106 Mo. 41, 16
S.W. 940.

## STANDING BY

Used in law as implying knowl-
edge, under such circumstances as rendered it the
duty of the possessor to communicate it; and it
is such knowledge, and not the mere fact of "stand-
ing by," that lays the foundation of responsibility.
The phrase does not import an actual presence,
"but implies knowledge under such circumstances
as to render it the duty of the possessor to com-
municate it." Anderson v. Hubble, 93 Ind. 573, 47
Am.Rep. 394; Gatling v. Rodman, 6 Ind. 292;

work is situate and in actual operation. The tin
miners of the stannaries have certain peculiar cus-
toms and privileges.

## STANN ARY COURTS

Courts of Devonshire and
Cornwall for the administration of justice among
the miners and tinners. These courts were held
before the lord warden and his deputies by virtue
of a privilege granted to the workers of the tin-
mines there, to sue and be sued in their own courts
only, in order that they might not be drawn away
from their business by having to attend law-suits
in distant courts. Brown.
STAPLE.
English Law
A mart or market. A place where the buying
and selling of wool, lead, leather, and other arti-
cles were put under certain terms. 2 Reeve, Eng.
Law, 393.
International Law
The right of staple, as exercised by a people
upon foreign merchants, is defined to be that they
may not allow them to set their merchandises and
wares to sale but in a certain place. This prac-
tice is not in use in the United States. 1 Chit.
Corn. Law, 103.
General
Law of the staple. Law administered in the
court of the mayor of the staple; the law-mer-
chant. 4 Inst. 235. See Staple.
Staple inn. An inn of chancery. See Inns of
Chancery.
Statute staple. The statute of the staple, 27 Ed.

## III

stat. 2, confined the sale of all commodities to
be exported to certain towns in England, called
estaple or staple, where foreigners might resort.
It authorized a security for money, commonly call-
ed statute staple, to be taken by traders for the
benefit of commerce; the mayor of the place is en-
titled to take recognizance of a debt in proper
form, which had the effect to convey the lands of
the debtor to the creditor till out of the rents and
profits of them he should be satisfied. 2 Rolle,
Abr. 446; Bac. Abr. Execution (B. 1) ; Co. 4th
Inst. 238. A security for a debt acknowledged to
be due, so called from its being entered into before
the mayor of the staple, that is to say, the grand
mart for the principal commodities or manufac-
tures of the kingdom, formerly held by act of
parliament in certain trading towns. In other
respects it resembled the statute-merchant, (q. v.,)
but like that has now fallen into disuse. 2 Bl.
Comm. 160; 1 Steph. Comm. 287.
STAR—CHAMBER. A court which originally had
jurisdiction in cases where the ordinary course of
justice was so much obstructed by one party,
through writs, combination of maintenance, or ov-
erawing influence that no inferior court would
find its process obeyed. The court consisted of
the privy council, the common-law judges, and (it
seems) all peers of parliament. In the reign of
Henry VIII. and his successors, the jurisdiction
of the court was illegally extended to such a de-
gree (especially in punishing disobedience to the
king's arbitrary proclamations) that it became
odious to the nation, and was abolished. 4 Steph.
Comm. 310; Sweet.

## STAR PAGE

The line and word at which the
pages of the first edition of a law book began are
frequently marked by a star in later editions, and
always should be.

## STARBOARD

In maritime law. The righthand
side of a vessel when the observer faces forward.
"Starboard tack," the course of vessel when she
has the wind on her starboard bow. Burrows v.
Gower, D.C.Mass., 119 F. 617.

## STARE DECISIS

Lat. To abide by, or adhere
to, decided cases.
Policy of courts to stand by precedent and not to
disturb settled point. Neff v. George, 364 Ill. 306,
4 N.E.2d 338, 390, 391. Doctrine that, when court
has once laid down a principle of law as applica-
ble to a certain state of facts, it will adhere to
that principle, and apply it to all future cases,
where facts are substantially the same. Moore v.
City of Albany, 98 N.Y. 396, 410; Regardless of
whether the parties and property are the same.
Horne v. Moody, Tex.Civ.App., 146 S.W.2d 505,
509, 510. Under doctrine a deliberate or solemn
decision of court made after argument on question
of law fairly arising in the case, and necessary to
its determination, is an authority, or binding prec-
edent in the same court, or in other courts of equal
or lower rank in subsequent cases where the
very point is again in controversy. State v. Mel-
lenberger, 163 Or. 233, 95 P.2d 709, 719, 720, 128
A.L.R. 1506. Doctrine is one of policy, grounded
on theory that security and certainty require that
which rights may accrue, be recognized and fol-
lowed, though later found to be not legally sound,
but whether previous holding of court shall be ad-
hered to, modified, or overruled is within court's
discretion under circumstances of case before it.
Otter Tail Power Co. v. Von Bank, 72 N.D. 497,
8 N.W.2d 599, 607, 145 A.L.R. 1343. Under doc-
trine, when point of law has been settled by de-
cision, it forms precedent which is not afterwards
to be departed from, and, while it should ordinar-
ily be strictly adhered to, there are occasions when
departure is rendered necessary to vindicate plain,
obvious principles of law and remedy continued
injustice. McGregor v. Provident Trust Co. of
Philadelphia, 119 Fla. 718, 162 So. 323. The doc-
trine is a salutary one, and should not ordinarily
be departed from where decision is of long stand-
ing and rights have been acquired under it, unless
considerations of public policy demand it. Coloni-
al Trust Co. v. Flanagan, 344 Pa. 556, 25 A.2d 728,
The doctrine is limited to actual determinations
in respect to litigated and necessarily decided ques-
tions, and is not applicable to dicta or obiter dicta.
In re Herle's Estate, 165 Misc. 46, 300 N.Y.S. 103.
Federal courts should in all instances follow the law of
the state with respect to the construction of state statutes,
and where that law has been determined by the courts of
last resort, their decisions are "stare decisis" and must
be followed, irrespective of federal courts' opinions con
cerning what the law ought to be, but with respect to the
pronouncement of other state courts, federal courts are
not so bound and may conclude that the decision does not
truly express the state law. Kehaya v. Axton, D.C.N.Y.,
32 F.Supp. 266, 268.
STARE DECISIS ET NON QUIETA MOVERE.
To adhere to precedents, and not to unsettle things
which are established. 87 Pa. 286; Ballard County
v. Kentucky County Debt Commission, 290 Ky.
770, 162 S.W.2d 771, 773. See Stare Decisis.

## STARE IN JUDICIO

Lat. To appear before a
tribunal, either as plaintiff or defendant.
STARR, or STARRA. The old term for contract
or obligation among the Jews, being a corruption
from the Hebrew word "shetar," a covenant, by
an ordinance of Richard I., no starr was allowed
to be valid, unless deposited in one of certain
repositories established by law, the most con-
siderable of which was in the king's exchequer at
Westminster; and Blackstone conjectures that the
room in which these chests were kept was thence
called the "starr-chamber." 4 Bl. Comm. 266, 267,
note a.

## STATE OF FACTS

Formerly, when a master in
chancery was directed by the court of chancery
to make an inquiry or investigation into any mat-
ter arising out of a suit, and which could not con-
veniently be brought before the court itself, each
party in the suit carried in before the master a
statement showing how the party bringing it in
represented the matter in question to be; and this
statement was technically termed a "state of
facts," and formed the ground upon which the evi-
dence was received, the evidence being, in fact,
brought by one party or the other, to prove his
own or disprove his opponent's state of facts.
And so now, a state of facts means the statement
made by any one of his version of the facts.
Brown.

income of the lunatic, who are his next of kin
and heir at law, who are proposed as his commit-
tees, and what annual sum is proposed to be al-
lowed for his maintenance, etc. From the state
of facts and the evidence adduced in support of it,
the master frames his report. Elmer, Lun. 22;

mean the capital or principal fund of a corpora-
tion or joint-stock company, formed by the con-
tributions of subscribers or the sale of shares;
the aggregate of a certain number of shares sev-
erally owned by the members or stockholders of
the corporation or the proportional share of an
individual stockholder; also the incorporeal prop-
erty which is represented by the holding of a cer-
tificate of stock; and in a wider and more remote
sense, the right of a shareholder to participate in
the general management of the Company and to
share proportionally in its net profits or earnings
or in the distribution of assets on dissolution, the
term "stock" has also been held to embrace not
only capital stock of a corporation but all corpo-
rate wealth and resources, subject to all corporate
liabilities and obligations. Whitman v. Consoli-
dated Gas, Electric Light & Power Co. of Balti-
more, 148 Md. 90, 129 A. 22, 27. See also Thayer
v. Wathen, 17 Tex.Civ.App. 382, 44 S.W. 906; Har-
rison v. Vines, 46 Tex. 15; Seawright v. Dickson,
16 Ga.App. 436, 85 S.E. 625, 628; Hood Rubber
Co. v. Commonwealth, 238 Mass. 369, 131 N.E.
201, 202.
"Stock" is distinguished from "bonds" and, ordinarily,
from "debentures," in that it gives right of ownership in
part of assets of corporation and right to interest in any
surplus after payment of debt. Carson, Pirie, Scott & Co.
import from the aggregate shares into which it is divided
by its charter (Farrington v. Tennessee, 95 U.S. 686, 24
L. Ed. 558; People v. Coleman, 126 N.Y. 437, 27 N.E. 818,
12 L.R.A. 762) ; the former includes only the fund of
money or other property derived by it from the sale or
exchange of its shares of stock, while the latter represents
the totality of the corporate assets and property ; Hamor
v. Engineering Co., C.C.Del., 84 F. 396. See "Capital
Stock."
The funded indebtedness of a state or government, also,
is often represented by stocks, shares of which are held by
its creditors at interest.
Classes of Corporate Stock
Preferred stock is a separate portion or class
of the stock of a corporation, which is accorded,
by the charter or by-laws, a preference or priority
in respect to dividends, over the remainder of the
stock of the corporation, which in that case is
called common stock. That is, holders of the pre-
ferred stock are entitled to receive dividends at a
fixed annual rate, out of the net earnings or prof-
its of the corporation, before any distribution of
earnings is made to the common stock. If the
earnings applicable to the payment of dividends
are not more than sufficient for such fixed annual
dividend, they will be entirely absorbed by the
preferred stock. If they are more than sufficient
for the purpose, the remainder may be given
entirely to the common stock (which is the more
usual custom) or such remainder may be dis-
tributed pro rata to both classes of the stock, in
which case the preferred stock is said to "partici-
pate" with the common. The fixed dividend on
preferred stock may be "cumulative" or "non-
cumulative." In the former case, if the stipulated
dividend on preferred stock is not earned or paid
in any one year, it becomes a charge upon the
surplus earnings of the next and succeeding
years, and all such accumulated and unpaid divi-
dends on the preferred stock must be paid off be-
fore the common stock is entitled to receive divi-
dends. In the case of "non-cumulative" preferred
stock, its preference for any given year is ex-
tinguished by the failure to earn or pay its divi-
dend in that year. If a corporation has no class
of preferred stock, all its stock is common stock.
The word "common" in this connection signifies
that all the holders of such stock are entitled to
an equal pro rata division of profits or net earn-
ings, if any there be, without any preference or
priority among themselves. Deferred stock is
rarely issued by American corporations, though it
is not uncommon in England. This kind of stock
is distinguished by the fact that the payment of
dividends upon it is expressly postponed until
some other class of stock has received a dividend,
or until some certain liability or obligation of the
corporation is discharged. If there is a class of
"preferred" stock, the common stock may in this
sense be said to be "deferred," and the term is
sometimes used as equivalent to "common" stock.
But it is not impossible that a corporation should
have three classes of stock: (1) Preferred, (2)
common, and (3) deferred; the latter class being
postponed, in respect to participation in profits,
until both the preferred and the common stock
had received dividends at a fixed rate. See Cook,
Corp. § 12; Scott v. Railroad Co., 93 Md. 475, 49 A.
327; Jones v. Railroad Co., 67 N.H. 234, 30 A.

Day v. U. S. Cast Iron Pipe & Foundry Co., 96
N.J.Eq. 736, 126 A. 302, 304.
Law of Descent
The term is used, metaphorically, to denote the
original progenitor of a family, or the ancestor
from whom the persons in question are all de-
scended; such descendants being called "branch
es." Matter of Samson's Estate, 139 Misc. 490,

Special stock of a corporation, in Massachusetts,

fixed time. The corporation is bound to pay a
fixed annual dividend on it as a debt. The holders
of it are in no event liable for the debts of the
corporation beyond their stock; and an issue of
special stock makes all the general stockholders,
liable for all debts and contracts of the corpora-
tion until the special stock is fully redeemed.

2 Ind.App. 47, 28 N.E. 119, 121.
This is called distinctively a subpcena ad testificandum.
Chancery Practice
A mandatory writ or process directed to and
requiring one or more persons to appear at a time
to come and answer the matters charged against
him or them. Gondas v. Gondas, 99 N.J.Eq. 473,
134 A. 615, 618,
The writ of subpcena was originally proceeding in courts
of common law to enforce attendance of witness, but was
used in chancery for same purpose as citation in courts of
civil and canon law, to compel appearance of defendant
and to require him to answer plaintiff's allegations on
oath. Gondas v. Gondas, 99 N.J.Eq. 473, 134 A. 615, 618.

## SUBPCENA AD TESTIFICANDUM

Lat. Sub-
poena to testify. A technical and descriptive term
for the ordinary subpcena. Catty v. Brockelbank,
124 N.J.Law 360, 12 A.2d 128, 129. See Subpoena.

the court, at the instances of a suitor, commands
a witness who has in his possession or control
some document or paper that is pertinent to the
issues of a pending controversy, to produce it at

Smith, 104 Fla. 91, 139 So. 794; Ex parte Hart, 240
Ala. 642, 200 So. 783, 785.

## SUBREPTIO

gifts of escheat, etc., from the king by concealing
the truth. Bell; Calvin.

mitted to obtain a pardon, title, or grant, by al-
leging facts contrary to truth.

## SUBROGATION

The substitution of one person
in the place of another with reference to a law-
ful claim, demand or right, Whyel v. Smith, 101
Fla. 971, 134 So. 552, 554; so that he who is sub-
stituted succeeds to the rights of the other in re-
latio.p to the debt or claim, and its rights, reme-
dies, or securities. Home Owners' Loan Corpora-
tion v. Baker, 299 Mass. 158, 12 N.E.2d 199, 201;
Gerken v. Davidson Grocery Co., 57 Idaho 670, 69
P.2d 122, 126. A legal fiction through which a
person who, not as a volunteer or in his own
wrong, and in absence of outstanding and superior
equities, pays debt of another, is substituted to
all rights and remedies of the other, and the debt
is treated in equity as still existing for his bene-
fit, and the doctrine is broad enough to include
every instance in which one party pays the debt
for which another is primarily answerable, and
which in equity and good conscience should have
been discharged by such other. Home Owners'
Loan Corporation v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 123
Conn. 232, 193 A. 769, 772. The principle which
lies at the bottom of the doctrine is that the per-
son seeking it must have paid the debt under
grave necessity to save himself a loss. The right
is never accorded to a volunteer. Callan Court
Co. v. Citizens & Southern Nat. Bank, 184 Ga. 87,
190 S.E. 831, 856.
"Subrogation" is equitable remedy borrowed from civil
law. Ierardi v. Farmers' Trust Co. of Newark, 4 W.W.
Harr. Del., 246, 151 A. 822, 825. And as a matter of
right, independently of agreement, takes place only for
the benefit of insurers ; or of one who, being himself a
creditor, has satisfied the lien of a prior creditor ; or for
the benefit of a purchaser who has extinguished an incum-
brance upon the estate which he has purchased; or of a
co-obligor or surety who has paid the debt which ought, in
whole or in part, to have been met by another. The doc-
trine of "subrogation" is not applied for the mere stranger
or volunteer who has paid the debt of another without any
assignment or agreement for subrogation, without being
under any legal obligation to make the payment, and with-
out being compelled to do so for the preservation of any
rights or property of his own. Harford Bank of Bel Air v.
Hopper's Estate, 169 Md. 314, 181 A. 751, 755.
It is also said that its elements are: (1) That party
claiming it shall have paid debt; (2) that he was not a
volunteer, but had a direct interest in discharge of debt or
lien; (3) that he was secondarily liable for debt or dis-
charge of lien; (4) that no injustice would be done to the
other party by allowance of the equity. Hampton Loan &
Exchange Bank v. Lightsey, 155 S.C. 222, 152 S.E. 425, 427.
Subrogation is of two kinds, either conventional
or legal; the former being where the subrogation
is express, by the acts of the creditor and the
third person; the latter being (as in the case Of
sureties) where the subrogation is effected or im-
plied by the operation of the law. Gordon v. Ste-
wart, 4 Neb., Unof., 852, 96 N.W. 628; Connecti-
cut Mut. L. Ins. Co. v. Cornwell, 72 Hun, 199, 25
N.Y.S. 348; French v. Grand Beach Co., 239 Mich.
575, 215 N.W. 13, 14; Meyer v. Florida Home
Finders, 90 Fla. 128, 105 So. 267, 268; Combs v.
Agee, 148 Va. 471, 139 S.E. 265, 266.

the capital stock of a corporation. Latimer v.
Bennett, 37 Ga.App. 246, 139 S.E. 570, 572. A "sub-
scriber" is one who has agreed to take stock from
the corporation on the original issue of such
stock. Jones v. Rankin, 19 N.M. 56, 140 P. 1120,

Subscription is the act of the hand, while attestation is
the act of the senses. To subscribe a paper published as a
will is only to write on the same paper the name of the
witness; to attest a will is to know that it was published
as such, and to certify the facts required to constitute an
actual and legal publication. In re Downie's Will, 42 Wis.
66, 76.

erty, or whether he has only left charges without any prop-
erty. Delaneuville v. Duhe, 114 La. 62, 38 So. 20, 22.

## SUDDEN HEAT OF PASSION

In the common-
law definition of manslaughter, this phrase means
an access of rage or anger, suddenly arising from
a contemporary provocation. It means that the
provocation must arise at the time of the killing,
and that the passion is not the result of a former
provocation, and the act must be directly caused
by the passion arising out of the provocation at
the time of the homicide. Stell v. State, Tex.Cr.
App., 58 S.W. 75; Farrar v. State, 29 Tex.App. 250,

## SUDDEN PERIL RULE

Under this rule, a de-
fendant who is guilty of primary negligence is
not liable in case of sudden peril where the peril
or alarm was caused by the negligence of the op-
posite party, apprehension of peril from the stand-
point of defendant seeking to excuse his primary
negligence was reasonable, appearance of danger
was so imminent as to leave no time for delibera-
tion. White v. Munson, Tex.Civ.App., 162 S.W.2d
429, 432.
But rule cannot be invoked by one bringing
emergency on or not using due care, tb avoid it.

lic Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 142 Kan. 43, 45 P.2d 839,
843, 106 A.L.R. 673. Word includes a proceeding
instituted by confession of judgment. Common-
wealth ex rel. Bradford County v. Lynch, 146 Pa.
Super. 469, 23 A.2d 77, 78.

## SUE OUT

To obtain by application; to petition
for and take out. Properly the term is applied
only to the obtaining and issuing of such process
as is only accorded upon an application first made;
but conventionally it is also used of the taking out
of process which issues of course. The term is
occasionally used of instruments other than writs.
Thus, we speak of "suing out" a pardon. See
South Missouri Lumber Co. v. Wright, 114 Mo.
326, 21 S.W. 811; Kelley v. Vincent, 8 Ohio St.
420; U. S. v. American Lumber Co., 29 C.C.A. 431,
85 F. 830.

## SUERTE

## SUFFER

To allow, to admit, or to permit.
Gregory v. Marks, C.C.I1l., Fed.Cas.No.5,802; 10
Fed.Cas. 1194, 1198; Osborne v. Winter, 133 Cal.
App. 664, 24 P.2d 892. It includes knowledge of
what is to be done under sufferance. First Nat.

tomary use of the word indicates some experience
of conscious pain. New York Life Ins. Co. v. Cal-
houn, C.C.A.Mo., 97 F.2d 896, 898.
To suffer an act to be done or a condition to exist is to
permit or consent to it; to approve of it, and not to hinder
it. It implies knowledge, a willingness of the mind and
responsible control or ability to prevent. Wilspn v. Nel-
son, 183 U.S. 191, 22 S.Ct. 74, 46 L.Ed. 147; Selleck v. Sel-
leek, 19 Conn. 505; Gregory v. U. S., C.C.N.Y., Fed.Cas.

Comm. 500, note.

## SUFFERENTIA PACIS

Lat. A grant or suffer-
ance of peace or truce.

## SUFFERING A RECOVERY

A recovery was ef-
fected by the party wishing to convey the land
suffering a fictitious action to be brought against
him by the party to whom the land was to be
conveyed, (the demandant,) and allowing the de-
mandant to recover a judgment against him for
the land in question. The vendor, or conveying
party, in thus assisting or permitting the demand-
ant so to recover a judgment against him, was
thence technically said to "suffer a recovery."
Brown.

## SUFFICIENT

Adequate, enough, as much as
may be necessary, equal or fit for end proposed,
and that which may be necessary to accomplish an
object. Brittain v. Industrial Commission of Ohio,
95 Ohio St. 391, 115 N.E. 110; Galveston, H. & S. A.
Ry. Co. v. Enderle, Tex.Civ.App., 170 S.W. 276,
277; Commissioners of Sinking Fund of Louisville

such quality, number, force, or value as to serve
a need or purpose. Nissen v. Miller, 44 N.M. 487,
105 P.2d 324, 326. As to sufficient "Consideration"
see that title.

## SUFFICIENT CAUSE

With respect to right to
remove officers does not mean any cause which
removing officer may deem sufficient, but means
legal cause, specifically relating to and affecting
administration of office, of substantial nature di-
rectly affecting public's rights and interests, touch-
ing officer's qualifications or his performance of
duties, and showing that he is not fit or proper to
hold office. Sausbier v. Wheeler, 252 App.Div.
267, 299 N.Y.S. 466, 472; Zurich General Accident
& Liability Ins. Co. v. Kinsler, 12 Cal.2d 98, 81
P.2d 913, 915.

## SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE

Adequate evidence;
such evidence, in character, weight, or amount,
as will legally justify the judicial or official action
demanded; according to circumstances, it may
be "prima facie" or "satisfactory" evidence, ac-
cording to the definitions of those terms given
above. People v. Stern, 33 Misc.Rep. 455, 68 N.
Y.S. 732; Mallery v. Young, 94 Ga. 804, 22 S.E.
142; Parker v. Overman, 18 How. 141, 15 L.Ed.
318; State v. Newton, 33 Ark. 284.
Sufficient evidence is that which is satisfactory for the
purpose; Mallery v. Young, 94 Ga. 804, 22 S.E. 142, 143.,
that amount of proof which ordinarily satisfies an unpreju-
diced mind, beyond a reasonable doubt; Cole v. McClure,
88 Ohio St. 1, 102 N.E. 264, 266. The term is not synony-
mous with "conclusive." Pensacola & A. R. Co. v. State,
5 So. 833, 835, 25 Fla. 310, 3 L.R.A. 661. But it may be
used interchangeably with the term "weight of evidence."

N.E. 161, 163. See, also, Satisfactory Evidence.

## SUFFOCATE

by strangling or asphyxiation. Stone v. Physi-
cians Casualty Ass'n of America, 130 Neb. 769, 266
N.W. 605, 607.

## SUFFRAGAN

Bishops who in former times
were appointed to supply the place of others dur-
ing their absence on embassies or other business
were so termed. They were consecrated as other
bishops were, and were anciently called "chorepis-
copi," or "bishops of the county," in contradis-
tinction to the regular bishops of the city or see.
The practice of creating suffragan bishop;, after
having long been discontinued, was recently re-
vived; and such bishops are now permanently
"assistant" to the bishops. Brown.
A suffragan is a titular bishop ordained to aid and assist
the bishop of the diocese in his spiritual function; or one
who supplieth the place instead of the bishop, by whose
suffrage ecclesiastical causes or matters committed to him
call these suffragans by the name of "subsidiary bishols."
Tomlins.

## SUFFRAGE

A vote; the act of voting; the
right or privilege of casting a vote at public elec-
tions. The last is the meaning of the term in such
phrases as "the extension of the suffrage," "uni-
versal suffrage," etc. Spitzer v. Fulton, 33 Misc.
257,68 N.Y.S. 660; Coneld v. Farrell, 38 Okl. 608,
134 P. 407, 409.
Participation in the suffrage is not of right, but is
granted by the state on a consideration of what is most
for the interest of the state, Cooley, Const., 2d Ed. 752;
Spencer v. Board of Registration, 8 D.C. 169, 29 Am.Rep.
582; U. S. v. Anthony, 11 Blatchf. 200, Fed.Cas.No.14,459.
The grant of suffrage makes it a legal right until it is re-
called, and it is protected by the law as property is.

## SIM RAGIUM

Lat. In Roman law. A vote.,
the right of voting in the assemblies of the peo-
ple.
Aid or influence used or promised to obtain
some honor or office; the purchase of office. Cod.
4, 3.

## SUGGEST

To introduce indirectly to the thought;
to propose with diffidence or modesty; to hint; to
intimate. Sims v. Ratcliff, 62 Ind.App. 184, 110 N.
E. 122, 123.

## SUGGESTIO FALSI

Lat. Suggestion or repre-
sentation of that which is false; false representa-
tion. To recite in a deed that a will was duly exe-
cuted, when it was not, is suggestio falsi; and to
conceal from the heir that the will was not duly
executed is suppressio veri. 1 P. Wms. 240, and
see Turney v. Avery, 92 N.J.Eq. 473, 113 A. 710.

## SUGGESTION

A suggesting, presentation of an
idea especially indirectly, as through association
of ideas, bringing before the mind for considera-
tion, action, solution, or the like. Artificial Ice &
Cold Storage Co. v. Martin, 102 Ind.App. 74, 198
N.E. 446, 449.
It is in the nature of a hint or insinuation, and lacks the
element of probability. Facts which merely suggest do not
raise an inference of the existence of the fact suggested,
and therefore a suggestion is much less than an inference
or presumption. Lopa v. Smith, 37 Ohio App. 346, 174 N.E.
258,259.
In practice. A statement, formally entered on
the record, of some fact or circumstance which
will materially affect the further proceedings in
the cause, or which is necessary to be brought to
the knowledge of the court in order to its right
disposition of the action, but which, for some rea-
son, cannot be pleaded. Thus, if one of the par-
ties dies after issue and before trial, his death
may be suggested on the record. C. J. Huebel Co.
v. Mackinnon, 186 Mich. 617, 152 N.W. 1098, 1100.

## SUGGESTION OF ERROR

Request for rehear-
ing. White v. State, 190 Miss. 589, 195 So. 479,
SUGGESTIVE INTERROGATION. A phrase
used by some writers to signify "leading question."
2 Benth. Jud. Ev. b. 3, c. 3. It is used in the French
law.

## SUI GENERIS

Lat. Of its own kind or class;
e., the only one of its own kind; peculiar.

## SUI IUEREDES

Lat. In the civil law. One's
own heirs; proper heirs. Inst. 2, 19, 2.

## SUI JURIS

Lat. Of his own right; possessing
full social and civil rights; not under any legal
disability, or the power of another, or guardian-
ship.
Having capacity to manage one's own affairs;
not under legal disability to act for one's self.
Story, Ag. § 2.

## SUICIDE

Self-destruction; the deliberate term-
ination of one's existence, while in the possession
and enjoyment of his mental faculties. See In-
surance Co. v. Moore, 34 Mich. 41; Weber v. Su-
preme Tent, 172 N.Y. 490, 65 N.E. 258, 92 Am.St.
Rep. 753; Daniels v. Railroad Co., 183 Mass. 393,
67 N.E. 424, 62 L.R.A. 751.
The term "suicide," as used in insurance policies, has
been held to mean death by one's own hand, irrespective of
mental condition. Great Southern Life Ins. Co. v. Camp-
bell, 148 Miss. 173, 114 So. 262, 263, 56 A.L.R. 681. But
other cases hold that intent is essential. Benard v. Pro-
tected Home Circle, 161 App. Div. 59, 146 N.Y.S. 232, 233;
American Nat. Ins. Co. v. Anderson, 42 Ga.App. 624, 157
S.E. 112.

## SUICIDE, SANE OR INSANE

An exemption
from liability for death by "suicide, sane or in-
sane," in a life policy includes self-destruction ir-
respective of the assured's mental condition at the
time of the act. United States Fidelity & Guar-
anty Co. v. Blum, C.C.A.Wash., 258 F. 897, 899;
Power v. Modern Brotherhood of America, 98 Kan.
487, 158 P. 870, 872.

## SUING AND LABORING CLAUSE

A clause in
an English policy of marine insurance, generally
in the following form: "In case of any loss or
misfortune, it shall be lawful for the assured, their
factors, servants and assigns, to sue, labor, and
travel for, in, and about the defense, safeguard,
and recovery of the" property insured, "without
prejudice to this insurance; to the charges where-
of we, the assurers, will contribute." The object
of the clause is to encourage the assured to exert
themselves in preserving the property from loss.
Sweet.
SUIT.
Old English Law
The witnesses or followers of the plaintiff. 3
Bl. Comm. 295. See Secta.
Old books mention the word in many connections which
are now disused,-at least, in the United States. Thus,
"suit" was used of following any one, or in the sense of
pursuit; as in the phrase "making fresh suit." It was
also used of a petition to the king or lord. "Suit of court"
was the attendance which a tenant owed at the court of his
lord. "Suit covenant" and "suit custom" seem to have
signified a right to one's attendance, or one's obligation
to attend, at the lord's court, founded upon a known cove-
nant, or an immemorial usage or practice of ancestors.
"Suit regal" was attendance at the sheriff's tourn or leet,
(his court.) "Suit of the king's peace" was pursuing an
offender,-one charged with breach of the peace, while
"suithold" was a tenure in consideration of certain services
to the superior lord. Abbott.
Modern Law
A generic term, of comprehensive signification,
and applies to any proceeding by one person or
persons against another or others in a court of
justice in which the plaintiff pursues, in such
court, the remedy which the law affords him for
the redress of an injury or the enforcement of a
right, whether at law or in equity. See Kohl v.
U. S., 91 U.S. 375, 23 L.Ed. 449; Weston v. Charles-
ton, 2 Pet. 464, 7 L.Ed. 481; Syracuse Plaster Co. v.
Agostini Bros. Bldg. Corporation, 169 Misc. 564,
7 N.Y.S.2d 897. It is, however, seldom applied to
a criminal prosecution. And it is sometimes re-
stricted to the designation of a proceeding in
equity, to distinguish such proceeding from an ac-
tion at law. Patterson v. Standard Accident Ins.
Co., 178 Mich. 288, 144 N.W. 491, 492, 51 L.R.A.,
N.S., 583. For "Ancillary" suit and suit "Jn Rem"
see those titles.
General
Class suits. See Class or Representative Ac-
tion.
Suit against state. Suit in which relief against
the state is sought. Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Bos-
worth, D.C.Ky., 209 F. 380, 401.
Within rule of state immunity from suit without its con-
sent, one in which the subject matter must be an interest
of value in a material sense to the state as a distinct en-
tity. American Federation of Labor v. Mann, Tex.Civ.
App., 188 S.W.2d 276, 279, 280. And in the determination
of whether a suit is one against the state, it is not neces-
sary that the state appear on the record as a party; but,
if the state is the real party against which the relief is
sought, the suit is a "suit against the state" although nom-
inally it appears on the record as a suit against one of its
officers. McKamey v. Aikin, Tex.Civ.App., 118 S.W.2d 482,
483, 484.
Suit money. An allowance, in the nature of
temporary alimony, authorized by statute in some
states to be made to a wife on the institution of
her suit for divorce, intended to cover the reason-
able expenses of the suit and to provide her with
means for the efficient preparation and trial of
her case. See Yost v. Yost, 141 Ind. 584, 41 N.E.
Suit of a civil nature. A suit for the remedy of
a private wrong, the test being whether the law
is penal in the strict and primary sense, and
whether the wrong is to the public or to the in-
dividual. City of Montgomery, Ala., v. Postal Tel-
egraph-Cable Co., D.C.Ala., 218 F. 471, 474.
Suit of court. This phrase denoted the duty of
attending the lord's court, and, in common with
fealty, was one of the incidents of a feudal hold-
ing. Brown.
Suit of the king's peace. The pursuing a man
for breach of the king's peace by treasons, insur-
rections, or trespasses. Cowell.
Suits or proceedings at law or in chancery. Suits
instituted and carried on in substantial conform-
ity with the forms and modes prescribed by the
common law or by the rules in chancery excluding
cases instituted and carried on solely in accord-
ance with statutory provisions. Lavin v. Wells
Bros. Co., 272 Ill. 609, 112 N.E. 271, 272.
Suit silver. A small sum of money paid in lieu

church or elsewhere, to have and maintain per-
petual obits, lamps, torches, etc., to be used at
certain times to help to save the souls of men
out of purgatory,—in such cases the king, by force
of several statutes, is authorized to direct and
appoint all such uses to such purposes as are truly
charitable. Bac. Abr. "Charitable Uses." The
doctrine has no recognition in this country; Ap-
peal of Seibert, 18 Wkly. Notes Cas., Pa., 276;
and a bequest to support a Catholic priest, and
perhaps other uses void in England, would not be
considered as superstitious uses. Harrison v.
Brophy, 59 Kan. 1, 51 P. 883, 40 L.R.A. 721.

may come within the doctrine of last clear chance

coexist, to wit: (1) That the injured party has
already come into a position of peril; (2) that the
injuring party then or thereafter becomes, or in
the exercise of ordinary prudence ought to have
become, aware, not only of that fact, but also that
the party in peril either reasonably cannot es-
cape from it or apparently will not avail himself
of opportunities open to him for doing so; (3)
that the injuring party subsequently has the op-
portunity by the exercise of reasonable care to
save the other from harm; and (4) that he fails
to exercise such care. Emmons v. New York and
S. R. Co., 108 Conn. 133, 142 A. 676, 677.

## SUPPLEMENTAL BILL IN NATURE OF BILL OF REVIEW

Employed to invoke jurisdiction
of court of chancery to recall one of its adjudica-
tions made while some fact existed which, if be-
fore court, would have prevented rendition of final
decree, and which, without negligence of party
presenting it, was not earlier presented to chan-
cellor. Brown v. Oehler, 114 Fla. 57, 152 So. 862.

## SUPPLEMENTAL CLAIM

A further claim
which was filed when further relief was sought
after the bringing of a claim. Smith, Ch. Pr. 655.

## SUPPLEMENTAL COMPLAINT

Under the
codes of practice obtaining in many of the states,
a complaint filed in an action to bring to the no-
tice of the court and the opposite party matters
occurring after the commencement of action and
which may affect the rights asserted. Pouder v.
Tate, 132 Ind. 327, 30 N.E. 880; Plumer v. Mc-

that an "amended complaint" is one which corrects merely
faults and errors of a pleading. Pantaleo v. Colt's Patent
Fire Arms Mfg. Co., D.C.N.Y., 13 F.Supp. 989, 990.

judgment or tax, and are proceedings in person-
am and not in rem. In re Maltbie, 119 N.E. 389,

## SUPPRESSIO VERI

Lat. Suppression or con-
cealment of the truth. It is a rule of equity, as
well as of law, that a suppressio yen is equiva-
lent to a suggestio falsi; and where either the
suppression of the truth or the suggestion of
what is false can be proved, in a fact material to
the contract, the party injured may have, relief
against the contract. Fleming v. Slocum, 18
Johns., N.Y., 405, 9 Am.Dec. 224; Turney v. Avery,
92 N.J.Eq. 473, 113 A. 710.

## SUPREME COURT

A court of high powers and

(such as New York) the supreme court is a court
of general original jurisdiction, possessing also
(in New York) some appellate jurisdiction, but not
the court of last resort.
Supreme court of errors. In American law. An
appellate tribunal, and the court of last resort, in
the state of Connecticut.
Supreme court of the United States. The court
of last resort in the federal judicial system. It
is vested by the constitution with original juris-
diction in all cases affecting ambassadors, public
ministers, and consuls, and those in which a state
is a party, and appellate jurisdiction over all other
cases within the Judicial power of the United
States, both as to law and fact, with such excep-
tions and under such regulations as congress may
make. Its appellate powers extend to the sub-
ordinate federal courts, and also (in certain cas-
es) to the supreme courts of the several states.
The court is composed of a chief justice and eight
associate justices.
Supreme judicial court. In American law. An
appellate tribunal, and the court of last resort, in
the states of Maine and Massachusetts.

## SUPREME COURT OF JUDICATURE

The
court formed by the English judicature act, 1873,
(as modified by the judicature act, 1875, the appel-
late jurisdiction act, 1876, and the judicature acts
of 1877, 1879, and 1881,) in substitution for the
various superior courts of law, equity, admiralty,
probate, and divorce, existing when the act was
passed, including the court of appeal in chancery
and bankruptcy, and the exchequer chamber. It
consists of two permanent divisions, viz., a court
of original jurisdiction, called the "high court of
justice," and a court of appellate jurisdiction,
called the "court of appeal." Its title of "supreme"
is now a misnomer, as the superior appellate ju-
risdiction of the house of lords and privy council,
which was originally intended. to be transferred to
it, has been allowed to remain. Sweet.
High Court of Justice
That branch of the English supreme court of
judicature (q. v.) which exercises (1) the original
jurisdiction formerly exercised by the court of
chancery, the courts of queen's bench, common
pleas, and exchequer, the courts of probate, di-
vorce, and admiralty, the court of common pleas
at Lancaster, the court of pleas at Durham, and
the courts of tile judges or commissioners of as-
size; and (2) the appellate jurisdiction of such
of those courts as heard appeals from inferior
courts. Judicature act, 1873, § 16.

## SUPREME POWER

The highest authority in a
state, all other powers in it being inferior there-
to. State ex rel. Hartley v. Clausen, 146 Wash.
588, 264 P. 403, 405.

## SUPREMUS

Lat. Last; the last.

## SUPREMUS EST QUEM NEMO SEQUITUR

He
is last whom no one follows. Dig. 50, 16, 92.

## SUR

Fr. On; upon; over. In the titles of real
actions "sur" was used to point out what the writ
was founded upon. Thus, a real action brought by
the owner of a reversion or seigniory, in certain
cases where his tenant repudiated his tenure, was
called "a writ of right sur disclaimer." So, a writ
of entry sur disseisin was a real action to recover
the possession of land from a disseisor. Sweet.

## SUR CUI ANTE DIVORTIUM

See Cui Ante Di-
vortium.

## SUR CUI IN VITA

A writ that lay for the heir
of a woman whose husband had aliened her land
cui in vita for the recovery thereof; in which
case her heir might have this writ against the ten-
ant after her decease. Cowell. See Cui in Vita.

## SUR DISCLAIMER

A writ in the nature of a
writ of right brought by the lord against a ten-
ant who had disclaimed his tenure, to recover the
land.

## SUR MORTGAGE

Upon a mortgage. In some
states the method of enforcing the security of a
mortgage, upon default, is by a writ of "scire
facias sur mortgage," which requires the defend-
ant (mortgagor) to show cause why it should not
be foreclosed.

## SURCHARGE

An overcharge; an exaction,
impost, or incumbrance beyond what is just and
right, or beyond one's authority or power. "Sur-
charge" may mean a second or further mortgage.
Wharton.

## SURCHARGE

To put more cattle upon a
common than the herbage will sustain or than the
party has a right to do. 3 Bl. Comm. 237.
Equity Practice
To show that a particular item, in favor of the
party surcharging, ought to have been included,
but was not, in an account which is alleged to be
settled or complete. To prove the omission of an
item from an account which is before the court
as complete, which should be inserted to the cred-
it of the party surcharging. Story, Eq. Jur. §
525; 2 Ves. 565; Perkins v. Hart, 24 U.S. 237, 11
Wheat. 237, 6 L.Ed. 463; Dempsey v. McGinnis,
203 Mo.App. 494, 219 S.W. 148, 150.
General
Second surcharge. In English law. The sur-
charge of a common a second time, by the same
defendant against whom the common was before
admeasured, and for which the writ of second sur-
charge was given by the statute of Westminster,
2. 3 Bl. Comm. 239.
Surcharge and falsify. This phrase, as used in
the courts of chancery, denotes the liberty which
these courts will occasionally grant to a plaintiff,
who disputes an account which the defendant al-
leges to be settled, to scrutinize particular items
therein without opening the entire account. The
showing an item for which credit ought to have
been given, but was not, is to surcharge the ac-
count; the proving an item to have been inserted
wrongly is to falsify the account. Brown. See
Philips v. Belden, 2 Edw. Ch., N.Y., 23; Rehill v.
McTague, 114 Pa. 82, 7 A. 224, 60 Am.Rep. 341;
Shores-Mueller Co. v. Bell, 21 Ga.App. 194, 94 S.E.
83, 84.

## SURDUS

Lat. In the civil law. Deaf; a deaf
person. Inst. 2, 12, 3. Surdus et mutus, a deaf
and dumb person.

## SURENCHERE

In French law. A party desir-
ous of repurchasing property at auction before
according to the case, in addition to the price real-
ized at the sale, oblige the property to be put up
once more at auction. This bid upon a bid is
called a "surenchare." Arg. Fr. Mere. Law, 575.

## SURETY

One who undertakes to pay money or
to do any other act in event that his principal
fails therein. In re Brock, 312 Pa. 92, 166 A. 778,
781. One bound with his principal for the pay-
ment of a sum of money or for the performance of
some duty or promise and who is entitled to be
indemnified by some one who ought to have paid
or performed if payment or performance be en-
forced against him. Anderson v. Trueman, 100
Fla. 727, 130 So. 12, 13. Everyone who incurs a
liability in person or estate, for the benefit of
another, without sharing in the consideration,
stands in the position of a "surety," whatever
may be the form of his obligation. Howell v.
War Finance Corporation, C.C.A.Ariz., 71 F.2d
237, 243.
A surety and guarantor have this in common, that they
are both bound for another person; yet there are points
of difference between them. A surety is usually bound
with his principal by the same instrument, executed at the
same time and on the same consideration. He is an orig-
inal promisor and debtor from the beginning, and is held
ordinarily to every known default of his principal. On tile
other hand, the contract of guarantor is his own separate
undertaking, in which the principal does not join. It is
usually entered into before or after that of the principal,
and is often founded on a separate consideration from that
supporting the contract of the principal. The original
contract of the principal is not the guarantor's contract,
and the guarantor is not bound to take notice of its non-
performance. The surety joins in the same promise as his
principal and is primarily liable; the guarantor makes a
separate and individual promise and is only secondarily
liable. His liability is contingent on the default of his
principal, and he only becomes absolutely liable when such
default takes place and he is notified thereof. Georgia
Casualty Co. v. Dixie Trust & Security Co., 23 Ga.App. 447,
98 S.E. 414, 416; Stifel Estate Co. v. Cella, 220 Mo.App.
657, 291 S.W. 515, 518; Ricketson v. Lizotte, 90 Vt. 386, 98
A. 801. "Surety" and "guarantor" are both answerable
for debt, default, or miscarriage of another, but liability
of guarantor is, strictly speaking, secondary and collateral,
while that of surety is original, primary, and direct. In
case of suretyship there is but one contract, and surety is
bound by the same agreement which binds his principal,
while in case of guaranty there are two contracts, and
guarantor is bound by independent undertaking. Howell
v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, C.C.A.8, 69 F.2d 447,
A surety is an insurer of the debt or obligation; a guar-
antor is an insurer of the solvency of the principal debtor
or of his ability to pay. McClain v. Georgian Co., 17 Ga.
App. 648, 87 S.E. 1090; Bishop v. Currie-McGraw Co., 133
Miss. 517, 97 So. 886, 889.

## SURETY COMPANY

A company, usually incor-
porated, whose business is to assume the respon-
sibility of a surety on the bonds of officers, trus-
tees, executors, guardians, etc., in consideration of
a fee proportioned to the amount of the security
required. See State ex rel. Travelers' Indemnity
Co. v. Knott, 114 Fla. 820, 153 So. 304.

## SURETY INSURANCE

This phrase is generally
used as synonymous with "guaranty insurance."
People v. Potts, 264 Ill. 522, 106 N.E. 524, 528.

## SURETY OF THE PEACE

A species of preven-
tive justice, and consists in obliging those persons
whom there is a probable ground to suspect of
future misbehavior, to stipulate with, and to give
full assurance to, the public that such offense as is
apprehended shall not take place, by finding pledg-
es or securities for keeping the peace, or for their
good behavior. Brown. See Hyde v. Greuch, 62
Md. 582.

## SURETYSHIP, CONTRACT OF

Contract where-
by one party engages to be answerable for debt,
default, or miscarriage of another and arises when
one is liable to pay debt or discharge obligation,
and party is entitled to indemnity from person
who should have made the payment in the first
instance before surety was so compelled. Brad-
ley v. Bentley, 163 So. 351, 231 Ala. 28. A contract
whereby one person engages to be answerable for
the debt, default, or miscarriage of another. Pitm..
Princ. & Sur. 1, 2; Scandinavian-American Bank
of Fargo v. Westby, 41 N.D. 276, 172 N.W. 665, 670..
An accessory promise by which a person binds
himself for another already bound, and agrees
with the creditor to satisfy the obligation, if the
debtor does not. Hope v. Board, 43 La.Ann. 738, 9
So. 754. A lending of credit to aid a principal
having insufficient credit of his own; the one ex-
pected to pay, having the primary obligation, be-
ing the "principal," and the one bound to pay, if
the principal does not, being the "surety." Roll-
ings v. Gunter, 211 Ala. 671, 101 So. 446, 448.
See Surety.
In contracts of "indemnity" against liability, the en-
gagement is to indemnify another against liability on some
obligation which he has incurred, or is about to incur, to
a third person, and is not, as in "suretyship," a promise
to one to whom another is answerable; in the former
there is direct privity between the promisor and promisee
and no debt owing by the third person to the promisee and
the promisee has no remedy against the third person,
whereas in the latter both principal and surety are bound
to answer to the promisee. McManus v. Tralles, Mo.App.,
253 S.W. 406, 409.

## SURFACE

This term, when used in law, is sel-
dom, if ever, limited to mere geometrical. super-
ficies, Clinchfield Coal Corporation v. Compton,
148 Va. 437, 139 S.E. 308, 312, 55 A.L.R. 1376; al-
though when used without any qualifying phrase
in a deed, it ordinarily signifies only the super-
ficial part of land, Drummond v. White Oak Fuel
Co., 104 W.Va. 368, 140 S.E. 57, 58, 56 A.L.R. 303.
And when employed in connection with mining, it
usually means that part of the earth or geologic
section lying over the minerals in question, unless
the contract or conveyance otherwise defines it.
Marquette Cement Mining Co. v. Oglesby Coal Co.,
D.C.I11., 253 F. 107, 111. Thus, where the surface
is granted to one and the underlying coal to an-
other, the "surface" includes the soil and waters
which lie above and are superincumbent on the
coal. Clinchfield Coal Corporation v. Compton,
148 Va. 437, 139 S.E. 308, 312, 55 A.L.R. 1376. Nev-
ertheless, a conveyance of the "surface," except
the oil and gas rights in the land, may be deemed,
under certain circumstances, to constitute a con-
veyance of all the land (including coal deposits),
except only the oil and gas rights specifically re-
served. Ramage v. South Penn Oil Co., 94 W.Va.
81, 118 S.E. 162, 171, 31 A.L.R. 1509.
The term "surface," when used as the subject of a con-
veyance, is not a definite one capable of a definition of
cording to the intention of the parties using it; and in
determining its meaning, regard may be had, not only to
the language of the deed in which it occurs, but, also to
the situation of the parties, the business in which they
were engaged, and to the substance of the transaction.
Ramage v. South Penn Oil Co., 94 W.Va. 81, 118 S.E. 162,
171, 31 A.L.R. 1509.

## SURFACE WATERS

## SURGEON

One whose profession or occupation
is to cure diseases or injuries of the body by man-
ual operation; one who practices surgery, Web-
ster; which is therapy of a distinctly operative
kind, such as cutting operations, the reduction and
putting up of fractures and dislocations and sim-
ilar manual forms of treatment; Napier v. Greenz-
weig, C.C.A.N.Y., 256 F. 196, 197.
Popularly, one possessing particular knowledge
and skill to correct and relieve some unnatural
condition of the human body. Maupin v. Southern
Surety Co., 205 Mo.App. 81, 220 S.W. 20, 21. One
whose occupation is to cure local injuries or dis-
orders, whether by manual operation, or by med-
ication and constitutional treatment. Stewart v.
Raab, 55 Minn. 20, 56 N.W. 256; Nelson v. State
Board of Health, 108 Ky. 769, 57 S.W. 501, 50 L.R.
A. 383; Surgery.

## SURGERY

The art or practice of healing by
manual operation; that branch of medical science
which treats of mechanical or operative measures
for healing diseases, deformities or injuries. State
v. Eustace, 117 Kan. 746, 233 P. 109, 110; Mary-
land Casualty Co. v. McCallum, 200 Ala. 154, 75 So.
902, 904. Therapy of a distinctly operative kind,
such as cutting operations, the reduction and put-
ting up of fractures and dislocations and similar
manual forms of treatment. Napier v. Greenz-
.weig, C.C.A.N.Y., 256 F. 196, 197. As used in stat-
utes, the term does not include osteopathy. Mo.
R.S.A. § 10042. Le Grand v. Security Benefit
Ass'n, 210 Mo.App. 700, 240 S.W. 852, 853. State v.
Eustace, 117 Kan. 746, 233 P. 109, 110.
Greek words signifying the hand and work. Originally,
it was part of the profession of barbers, but later was
taken up by physicians and now is recognized as that
branch of medical science, and more specifically, that
branch of medical science which treats of mechanical or
operative measures for healing diseases, deformities, or in-
juries. State ex rel. Beck v. Gleason, 148 Kan. 1, 79 P.2d
The practice of medicine, in contradistinction to the
practice of surgery, denotes the treatment of disease by
the administration of drugs or other sanative substances.
There cannot be a •complete separation between the prac-
tice of medicine and surgery; the principles of both are
the same throughout, and no one is qualified to practice
either who does not properly understand the fundamental
principles of both.

## SURGICAL OPERATION

An act or series of
acts performed on a patient's body by a surgeon
to produce a cure. Hartford Live Stock Ins. Co.
v. McMillen, C.C.A.Ohio, 9 F.2d 961, 962.

## SURMISE

Formerly where a defendant pleaded
a local custom, for instance, a custom of the city
of London, it was necessary for him to "surmise,"
that is, to suggest that such custom should be cer-
tified to the court by the mouth of the recorder,
and without such a surmise the issue was to be
tried by the country as other issues of fact are. 1
Burrows, 251; Vin. Abr. 246.
Something offered to a court to move it to grant
a prohibition, audita querela, or other writ grant-
able thereon. Jacob.
In ecclesiastical law. An allegation in a libel.
A collateral surmise is a surmise of some fact
not appearing in the libel. Phillim. Ecc. Law,
SURNAME. The family name; the name over
*and above the Christian name. The part of a
name which is not given in baptism; the name of
a person which is derived from the common name
of his parents; In re Faith's Application, 22 N.J.
Misc. 412, 39 A.2d 638, 640. The last name; the
name common to all members of a family. A pa-
tronymic. Riley v. Litchfield, 168 Iowa 187, 150
N.W. 81, 83, Ann.Cas.1917B, 172.

## SURPLICE FEES

In English ecclesiastical law.
Fees payable on ministerial offices of the church;
such as baptisms, funerals, marriages, etc.

## SURPLUS

That which remains of a fund appro-
priated for a particular purpose; the remainder
of a thing; the overplus; the residue. Smith v.
Cotting, 231 Mass. 42, 120 N.E. 177, 181; People's
F. Ins. Co. v. Parker, 35 N.J.L. 577; Towery v.
McGaw, 22 Ky.Law.Rep. 155, 56 S.W. 727; Appeal
of Coates, 2 Pa. 137; 18 Ves. 466.
The "surplus" of a corporation may mean either the net
assets of the corporation in excess of all liabilities includ-
ing capital stock, Winkelman v. General Motors Corpora-
tion, D.C.N.Y., 44 F.Supp. 960, 996; or what remains after
making provisions Tor all liabilities of every kind, except
capital stock. Insurance Co. of North America v. McCoach,
C.C.A.Pa., 224 F. 657, 658. The term is also defined as the
residue of assets after defraying liabilities, Douglas v.
Edwards, C.C.A.N.Y., 298 F. 229, 237; Cochrane v. Inter-
state Packing Co., 139 Minn. 452, 167 N.W. 111, 113; the
excess of net assets over the face value of the stock. Sex-
ton v. C. L. Percival Co., 189 Iowa 586, 177 N.W. 83, 86;
the excess of gross assets over the outstanding capital
stock, without deducting debts or liabilities; State v.
State Tax Commission ex rel. Marquette Hotel Inv. Co.,
282 Mo. 213, 221 S.W. 721, 722; and as the accumulation
of moneys or property in excess of the par value of the
stock. Small v. Sullivan, 245 N.Y. 343, 157 N.E. 261, 263.
There is a sharp distinction between the "surplus," as of
a bank, and undivided profits. Surplus, like the capital
stock, constitutes the working capital of the bank and is,
in addition, a fund for the protection of the depositors.
First Nat. Bank v. Moon, 102 Kan. 334, 170 P. 33, 34, L.R.
A.1918C, 986. The "undivided profits" constitute a tempo-
rary fund changing in size from day to day and carried
only until dividend periods when it is distributed to the
stockholders or transferred to the permanent surplus. It
is the fund from which the expenses and losses of the bank
are paid. Sarles v. Scandinavian American Bank, 33 N.D.
40, 156 N.W. 556, 557. Willcuts v. Milton Dairy Co., 48
S.Ct. 71, 72, 275 U.S. 215, 72 L.Ed. 247; State ex rel. Payne
v. Exchange Bank of Natchitoches, 147 La. 25, 84 So. 481,
As to surplus "Earnings," "Profits," and "Wa-
ter," see those titles.

## SURPLUSAGE

Extraneous, impertinent, super-
fluous, or unnecessary matter. In re Wolcott's Es-
tate, 54 Utah, 165; 180 P. 169, 170, 4 A.L.R. 727.
Accounts
A greater disbursement than the charge of the
accountant amounts unto. In another sense, the
remainder or overplus of money left. Jacob. A
balance over. 1 Lew. 219.
Pleading
Allegations of matter wholly foreign and im-
pertinent to the cause. All matter beyond the
circumstances necessary to constitute the action.
5 East 275; Allaire v. Ouland, 2 Johns. Cas. (N.Y.)
52; Adams v. Capital State Bank, 74 Miss. 307, 20
So. 881; Bradley v. Reynolds, 61 Conn. 271, 23 A.
928; State v. Kavanaugh, 203 La. 1, 13 So.2d 366,
371. Any allegation without which the pleading
would yet be adequate. Mathews v. U. S., C.C.A.
Neb., 15 F.2d 139, 142; State v. Williams, 94 Vt.
423, 111 A. 701, 708; People v. Osborne, 278 Ill.
104, 115 N.E. 890, 891.

## SURPLUSAGIUM NON NOCET

Surplusage does
no harm. 3 Bouv. Inst. no. 2949; Broom, Max. 627.

## SURPRISE

Act of taking unawares; sudden con-
fusion or perplexity. Davis v. Steuben School Tp.,
19 Ind.App. 694, 50 N.E. 1. In its legal acceptation,
denotes an unforeseen disappointment against
which ordinary prudence would not have afforded
protection. Patrick v. Boonville Gas Light Co., 17
Mo.App. 462, 463, 465.
Equity Practice.
The act by which a party who is entering into a
contract is taken unawares, by which sudden con-
fusion or perplexity is created, which renders it
proper that a court of equity should relieve the
party so surprised. 2 Brown, Ch. 150.
The situation in which a party is placed with-
out any default of his own, which will be injur-
ious to his interests. Rawle v. Skipwith, 8 Mart.
N. S., La., 407.
Anything which happens without the agency or fault of
the party affected by it, tending to disturb and confuse
the judgment, or to mislead him, of which the opposite
party takes an undue advantage, is in equity a surprise,
and one species of fraud for which relief is granted. Gid-
lonsen v. Union Depot R. Co., 129 Mo. 392, 31 S.W. 800;
Heath v. Scott, 65 Cal. 548, 4 Pac. 557; Zimmerer v. Fre-
mont Nat. Bank, 59 Neb. 661, 81 N.W. 849; Thompson v.
Connell, 31 Or. 231, 48 P. 467, 65 Am.St.Rep. 818.
There does not seem anything technical or peculiar in
the word "surprise," as used in courts of equity. Where a
court of equity relieves on the ground of surprise, it does
so upon the ground that the party has been taken un-
awares, and that he has acted without due deliberation,
and under confused and sudden impressions. 1 Story, Eq.
Jur. 120, note. But Jeremy, Eq.Jur. 366, 383, note, seems
to think that the word surprise is a technical expression,
and nearly synonymous with fraud. It is sometimes used
in this sense when it is deemed presumptive of, or ap-
proaching to, fraud. 1 Fonbl.Eq. 123; 3 Ch.Cas. 56, 74,
103, 114.
Law
As a ground for a new trial, that situation in
which a party is unexpectedly placed without de-
fault on his part, which will work injury to his in-
terests. State v. Price, 100 W.Va. 699, 131 S.E.
710, 711. He must show himself to have been dili-
gent at every stage of the proceedings. Hender-
son v. Hazlett, 75 W.Va. 255, 83 S.E. 907, 908. And
that the event was one which ordinary prudence
could not have guarded against; Cupples v. Zu-
pan. 35 Idaho, 458, 207 P. 328, 329; .Jennings v.
American President Lines, 61 Cal.App.2d 417, 143
P.2d 349, 356.
A situation, status, or result produced, having a
substantive basis of fact and reason, from which
the court may justly deduce, as a legal conclusion,
that the party will suffer a judicial wrong if not
relieved from his mistake. Levy v. Caledonian
Ins. Co., D.C.Cal., 226 F. 336, 337.
The general rule is that when a party or his counsel is
"taken by surprise," in a material point or circumstance
which could not have been anticipated, and when want of
skill, care, or attention cannot be justly imputed, and in-
justice has been done, a new trial should be granted. Hill.
New Trials, 521.

## SURREBUTTER

In pleading. The plaintiff's an-
swer of fact to the defendant's rebutter. Steph.
Pl. 59. It is governed by the same rules as the
replication. See 6 Com. Dig. 185; 7 id. 389.

## SURREJOINDER

In pleading. The plaintiff's
answer of fact to the defendant's rejoinder. Steph.
Pl. 59. It is governed in every respect by the same
rules as the replication. Steph. PL 77; 7 Com.
Dig. 389.

## SURRENDER

To give back; yield; render up;
restore; and in law the giving up of an estate to
the person who has it in reversion or remainder, so
as to merge it in the larger estate; the giving up
of a lease before its expiration; yielding up a
tenancy in a copyhold estate to the lord of the
manor for a specified purpose; a deed by which
surrender is made; the giving up by a bankrupt of
his property to his creditors or their assignees;
also, his due appearance in the bankruptcy court
for examination as formerly required by the bank-
ruptcy acts. In re Emlen's Estate, 333 Pa. 238,
4 A.2d 143, 145; Nolander v. Burns, 48 Minn. 13,
50 N.W. 1016.
A yielding up of an estate for life or years to him who
has an immediate estate in reversion or remainder, where-
in the estate for life or years may drown by mutual agree-
ment between them. Roberts Inv. Co. v. Hardie Mfg. Co.,
142 Or. 179, 19 P.2d 429, 431; Kimberlin v. Hicks, 150 Kan.
449, 94 P.2d 335, 339.
"Surrender" is contractual act and occurs only through
consent of both parties. Motch's Adm'r v. Portner, 237
Ky. 25, 34 S.W.2d 744, 745.
Surrender differs from "abandonment," as applied to
leased premises, inasmuch as the latter is simply an act
on the part of the lessee alone; but to show a surrender,
a mutual agreement between lessor and lessee that the
lease is terminated must be clearly proved. Noble v.
Sturm, 210 Mich. 462, 178 N.W. 99, 106.
A surrender is of a nature directly opposite to a release;
for, as the latter operates by the greater estate descending
upon the less, the former is the falling of a less estate
into a greater, by deed. Shepp.Touchst. 300.

## SURRENDER BY BAIL

The act, by bail or sure-
ties in a recognizance, of giving up their principal
again into custody, in their own discharge. 1
Burrill, Pr. 394.

## SURRENDER BY OPERATION OF LAW

This
phrase is properly applied to cases where the ten-
ant for life or years has been a party to some act
the validity of which he is by law afterwards es-
topped from disputing, and which would not be
valid if his particular estate continued to exist.
Ledsinger v. Burke, 113 Ga. 74, 38 S.E. 313; Brown
v. Cairns, 107 Iowa, 727, 77 N.W. 478. An implied
surrender occurs when an estate incompatible
with the existing estate is accepted, or the lessee
takes a new lease of the same lands. Livingston
v. Potts, 16 Johns., N.Y., 28; 1 B. & Ald. 50. See
Beall v. White, 94 U.S. 389, 24 L.Ed. 173; Martin
v. Stearns, 52 Iowa, 347, 3 N.W. 92.
The rule of law as now settled by recently adjudicated
cases is that any acts which are equivalent to an agree-
ment on the part of the tenant to abandon, and on the part
of the landlord to resume the possession of the demised
premises, amount to a "surrender by operation of law."
Carlton Chambers Co. v. Trask, 261 Mass. 264, 158 N.E.
786, 788; 1375-83 Broadway Corporation v. Filler, 267
N.Y.S. 779, 149 Misc. 474. The rule may be safely said to
be that a surrender is created by operation of law, when
the parties to a lease do some act so inconsistent with the
subsisting relation of landlord and tenant as to imply that
they have both agreed to consider the surrender as made.
Flannagan v. Dickerson, 103 Okl. 206, 229 P. 552, 553;
Hodgkiss v. Dayton-Brower Co., 156 N.Y.S. 907, 908, 93
Misc. 109; Triest & Co. v. Goldstone, 173 Cal. 240, 159 P.
715, 716.

## SURRENDER OF CHARTER

A corporation cre-
ated by charter may give up or "surrender" its
charter to the people, unless the charter was grant-
ed under a statute, imposing indefeasible duties
on the bodies to which it applies. Grant, Corp.

## SURRENDER OF COPYHOLD

The mode of con-
veying or transferring copyhold property from
one person to another is by means of a surrend-
er, which consists in the yielding up of the estate
by the tenant into the hands of the lord for such
purposes as are expressed in the surrender. The
process in most manors is for the tenant to come
to the steward, either in court or out of court, or
else to two customary tenants of the same manor,
provided there be a custom to warrant it, and
there, by delivering up a rod, a glove, or other
symbol, as the custom directs, to resign into the
hands of the lord, by the hands and acceptance of
his steward, or of the said two tenants, all his in-
terest and title to the estate, in trust, to be again
granted out by the lord to such persons and for
such uses as are named in the surrender, and as
the custom of the manor will warrant. Brown.

## SURRENDER OF CRIMINALS

The act by
which the public authorities deliver a person ac-
cused of a crime, and who is found in their juris-
diction, to the authorities within whose jurisdic-
tion it is alleged the crime has been committed.

## SURRENDER OF A PREFERENCE

In bank-
ruptcy practice. The surrender to the assignee
in bankruptcy, by a preferred creditor, of anything
he may have received under his preference and
any advantage it gives him, which he must do be-
fore he can share in the dividend. In re Richter's
Estate, 1 Dill. 544, Fed.Cas.No.11,803. The word
as generally defined may denote either compelled
or voluntary action. Keppel v. Bank, 197 U.S.
356, 25 S.Ct. 443, 49 L.Ed. 790. In. Bankruptcy Act
1898, § 57g (11 U.S.C.A. § 93 (g), providing that
creditors must surrender preferences before hav-
ing claims allowed, it is unqualified and generic,
and hence embraces both meanings. Keppel v.
Bank, supra.

## SURRENDER TO USES OF WILL

Formerly a
copyhold interest would not pass by will unless it
had been surrendered to the use of the will. By
St. 55 Geo. III. c. 192, this is no longer necessary.
1 Steph. Comm. 639; Mozley & Whitley.

## SURRENDEREE

render is made.

en in some of the states to the judge or judicial
officer who has the administration of probate mat-
ters, guardianships, etc. See Malone v. Sts. Peter
& Paul's Church, 172 N.Y. 269, 64 N.E. 961. In oth-
er states he is called judge of probate, register,
judge of the orphans' court, etc. He is ordinar-
ily a county officer, with a local jurisdiction lim-
ited to his county.
In English law. One that is substituted or ap-
pointed in the room of another, as by a bishop,
chancellor, judge, etc.; especially an officer ap-
pointed to dispense licenses to marry without
banns. 2 Steph. Comm. 247.

## SURROGATE'S COURT

In the United States. A
state tribunal, with similar jurisdiction to the
court of ordinary, court of probate, etc., relating
to matters of probate, etc. 2 Kent, Comm. 409,
note b. And see Robinson v. Fair, 9 S.Ct. 30, 128
U.S. 53, 32 L.Ed. 415; In re Hawley, 104 N.Y. 250,
10 N.E. 352.

## SURROUND

To inclose on all sides; to encom-
pass. In re Creveling, Cust. & Pat.App., 61 F.2d
862, 863.

## SURROUNDING CIRCUMSTANCES

Which
may permit inference of culpability on part of
defendant under res ipsa loquitur rule refers, not
'co circumstances directly tending to show lack of
care, but only to mere neutral circumstances of
control and management by defendant, which
may, when explained, appear to be entirely con-
sistent with due care. Hepp v. Quickel Auto &

eral meaning, inclusive of what is commonly call-
ed the "application," which contains the questions
propounded on behalf of the company, and the
answers of the assured. Albion Lead Works v.

cipal ports of entry, whose duties chiefly concern
the importations at his station and the determina-
tion of their amount and valuation. Rev.St.U.S. §

## SURVIVAL STATUTES

Statutory provision for
the survival, after death of the injured person, of
certain causes of action for injury to the person
whether death results from the injury or from
some other cause. The cause of action which sur-
vives is for the wrong to the injured person. In
re Daniel's Estate, 294 N.W. 465, 208 Minn. 420.

the life, or existence of; to continue to live or
exist beyond (a specified period or event); to live
through in spite of; live on after passing through;
to remain alive; exist in force or operation be-
yond any period specified. Thompson v. New Or-

## SURVIVOR

One who survives another; one who
outlives another; one who lives beyond some hap-
pening; one of two or more persons who lives
after the death of the other or others. Baker v.
Baker, 182 Ala. 194, 62 So. 284, 286.
The word "survivor," however, in connection with the
power of one of two trustees to act, is used not only with
reference to a condition arising where one of such trustees
dies, but also as indicating a trustee who continues to
administer the trust after his cotrustee is disqualified, has
been removed, renounces, or refuses to act. Busch v.
Schuttler, 216 Ill. App. 212, 217.

## SURVIVORSHIP

The living of one of two or
more persons after the death of the other or oth-
ers.
Survivorship is where a person becomes entitled to prop-

59, 62, 259 App.Div. 432; United States v. Jacobs, III. &
N. Y., 306 U.S. 363, 59 S.Ct. 551, 555, 83 L.Ed. 763.

## SUS

PER COLL. An abbreviation of "suspenda-

1364,

## SUSPECT

To have a slight or even vague idea
concerning;—not necessarily involving knowledge
or belief or likelihood. Cheek v. Missouri, K. &
T. Ry. Co., 89 Kan. 247, 131 P. 617, 624.
"Suspect" with reference to probable cause as grounds
for arrest without warrant is ordinarily used in place of
the word believe. U. S. v. Rembert, D.C.Tex., 284 F. 996,
1001. But to "suspect and believe" that a person, claiming
to have been falsely imprisoned by a deputy sheriff, is a
felon, is not the legal equivalent of belief on probable
cause. Hill v. Wyrosdick, 216 Ala. 235, 113 So. 49, 50.

## SUSPEND

To interrupt; to cause to cease for
a time; to postpone; to stay, delay, or hinder; to
discontinue temporarily, but with an expectation
or purpose of resumption. To forbid a public of-
ficer, attorney, employee, or ecclesiastical person

O'Hara, 98 Pa. 232; Reeside v. U. S., 8 Wall. 42,
19 L.Ed. 318; U. S. v. Felder, D.C.N.Y., 13 F.2d
527, 528; Bishop v. Bacon, 130 Pa.Super. 240, 196

derson, 43 S.D. 630, 181 N.W. 839, 840; People ex
rel. Holton v. Hunt, 217 App.Div. 428, 216 N.Y.S.
765, 768, To stay, as a decree;—not synonymous
with vacate. Stewart v. Oneal, C.C.A.Ohio, 237 F.
897, 903.
To cause a temporary cessation, as of work by
an employee; to lay off;—not synonymous with
remove. Thomas v. City of Chicago, 194 Ill.App.
526, 529.
Also, sometimes, to discontinue or dispense with
(permanently) ; to remove permanently from of-
fice; to discharge (an employee) permanently.
Phelps v. Connellee, Tex.Civ.App., 278 S.W. 939,
941. See Suspension.

## SUSPENSE

When a rent, profit a prendre, and

revived or awakened. Co. Litt. 313a.

## SUSPENSION

A temporary stop, a temporary
delay, interruption, or cessation. Hood ex rel.
North. Carolina Bank & Trust Co. v. Clark, 211
N.C. 693, 191 S.E. 732, 733.
A temporary stop of a right, of a law, and the like.
Thus, we speak of a suspension of the writ of habeas cor-
pus, of a statute, of the power of alienating an estate, of a
person in office, etc..

from the privileges of an institution or society.

from public work as distinguished from perma-
nent severance accomplished by removal, Bois v.
City of Fall River, 257 Mass. 471, 154 N.E. 270;

which may on occasion include suspension. State
v. Medler, 19 N.M. 252, 142 P. 376, 379.
Ecclesiastical Law
An ecclesiastical censure, by which a spiritual
person is either interdicted the exercise of his ec-

Is deprived of the exercise of his right for a time.
A temporary stop of a right, a partial extinguish..
ment for a time, as contrasted with a complete ex-
tinguishment, where the right is absolutely dead.
In re Muser's Estate, 122 Misc. 164, 203 N.Y.S. 619,
621. Suspension of a right in an estate is a tem-
porary or partial withholding of it from use or
exercise. It differs from extinguishment, because
a suspended right is susceptible of being revived,
which is not the case where the right was extin-
guished. Bac. Abr. Extinguishment (A).
Suspension of a statute. A temporary stop.
Chicago, R. I. & P. Ry. Co. v. Holliday, 45 Okl.
536, 145 P. 786, 793. The suspension of a statute
for a limited time operates so as to prevent its
operation for the time; but it has not the effect
of a repeal. Brown v. Barry, 3 U.S. 365, 3 Dall.
365, 1 L.Ed. 638.
Suspension of arms. An agreement between
belligerents, made for a short time or for a par-
ticular place, to cease hostilities between them.

ness operations, evidenced by some objective fea-
tures; an interruption of the ordinary course of

ing obligations. Hoover Steel Ball Co. v. Schafer
Ball Bearings Co., 89 N.J.Eq. 433, 105 A. 500, 501..

behavior give good ground for suspicion and who
can give no good account of himself, and who may
therefore be arrested or required to give security
for good behavior. See McFadin v. San Antonio,
22 Tex.Civ.App. 140, 54 S.W. 48; People v. Russell,
35 Misc.Rep. 765, 72 N.Y.Supp. 1; 4 Bl. Comm.

International Law
A state that exercises political control over an-
other state, in relation to which it is sovereign.
Webster.
The word has no clear or precise signification. It has
been extended to the control of European Powers through
their colonies over imperfectly civilized people. 12 L.
Quart.Rev. 223; 1896, p. 122. See, also, Hershey, Int.L.
In modern times suzerainty is used as descriptive of
relations, ill-defined and vague, which exist between pow-
erful and dependent states; its very indefiniteness being
its recommendation. While protecting and protected states
tend to draw nearer, the reverse is true of suzerain and
vassal states; a protectorate is generally the preliminary
to incorporation; suzerainty, to separation. Encycl.Br.
It is said that suzerainty is title without corresponding
power ; protectorate is power without corresponding title.
Freund, Pol.Sci.Quart. 1899, p. 28.
SWAIN; SWAINMOTE. See Swein; Sweinmote.

The questioning of a person in cus-
tody charged with crime with intent to obtain in-
formation concerning his connection therewith or
knowledge thereof by plying him with questions,
or by threats or other wrongful means, extorting
information to be used against him. Under the
statute mere questioning amounts to "sweating"
if done for the purpose of extorting from the ac-
cused information to be used against him; that is,
inducing him to unwillingly or involuntarily give
such information. Commonwealth v. , McClana-
han, 153 Ky. 412, 155 S.W. 1131, 1132, Ann.Cas.

it to his own use. 2 Russ.Cr. 130; Stevenson v.
Hayden, 2 Mass. 406; Jones v. State, 97 Ga. 430,
25 S.E. 319.
The acquisition of any personal or movable

priate the same to the use of the party so acquir-
ing, or of destroying or impairing the rights of the
party justly entitled to the same. May v. State,
15 Tex.App. 436; Cochrain v. State, 93 Tex.Cr.R.
483, 248 S.W. 43, 44.
To make out offense of "cheating" and "swindling" by
false representations, state must prove that representations
were made, that representations were knowingly and de-
signedly false, that representations were made with intent
to defraud, that representations did defraud, that repre-
sentations related to existing fact or past event, and that

truth, was thereby induced to part with his property. Code
1933, § 26-7401 et seq. Diamond v. State, 52 Ga.App. 184,
182 S.E. 813, 814.

## SWITCH

A mechanical device which turns a
movable object from one course to another. Jeff-
ery v. Kewaunee, G. B. & W. Ry. Co., 189 Wis. 207,
207 N.W. 283, 284.

## SWITCH-YARD DOCTRINE

The doctrine that
there can be no implied license to the public to
use the track of a railroad company within the
limits of its switch-yard. Binion v. Central of
Georgia Ry. Co., 12 Ga.Ap1). 663, 78 S.E. 131
SWITCHING MOVEMENT or OPERATION. This
term becomes of importance in determining
whether or not the Safety Appliance Act (45 U.S.
C.A. § 1 et seq.) is applicable to a particular set of
facts, and is distinguished from "train movement."
Thus, the continuous movement of freight cars, reas-
sembled after switching, from one portion of a railroad
yard to another 4,500 feet away, through the business or
warehouse part of a city, and crossing several city streets
at grade, was held to be a "train movement," and not a
"switching operation." Illinois Cent. R. Co. v. U. S., C.C.
A.Neb., 14 F.2d 747, 748.

## SWITCHING SERVICE

This term is principally
used in law in contradistinction to "transportation
service," for which different rates may be set.
"Transportation service" is one which requires no
other service to complete the shipper's object,
while "switching service" is one which precedes
or follows transportation service. Andrews Steel
Co. v. Davis, 210 Ky. 473, 27.6 S.W. 148, 150; on
which legal freight charges have already been
earned, or are to be earned. Louisville Water Co.
v. Illinois . Cent. R. Co., D.C.Ky., 14 F.Supp. 301,
303. The word "switching" in this connection is
synonymous with "transferring." J. B. Doppes
Sons Lumber Co. v. Cincinnati, N. 0. & T. P. Ry.
Co., supra. The test of distinction between these
two services is not only whether the switching
service follows transportation, but whether the
movement of cars is under the yard-master's di-
rection, in which case it is switching service, or
under the trainmaster's direction, in which event
it is transportation service. St. Louis, I. M. & S.
Ry. Co. v. Clark Pressed Brick Co., 127 Ark. 474,
192 S.W. 382, 384.
"Switching services" may also be distinguished from a
"line haul," in that the latter is a definite service ren-
dered between two definite points, to which switching is
a mere incident. Cummings Sand & Gravel Co. v. Minne-
apolis & St. L. Ry. Co., 182 Iowa, 955, 166 N.W. 354, 356,
L.R.A.1918C, 797.

## SWITCHING TRACKS

Tracks for use in load-
ing, reloading, storing, and switching cars, and
other things incidental to railroad's regular train
haul. Missouri Pac. R. Co. v. Chicago Great West-
ern R. Co., 137 Kan. 217, 19 P.2d 484, 489.

## SWOLING OF LAND

plow can till in a year; a hide of land. Cowell.

## SWORN

"verified." Francesconi v. Independent School
Dist. of Wall Lake, 204 Iowa, 307, 214 N.W. 882,
885. See Swear.

duties were to keep the records, make copies of
pleadings, etc. Their offices were abolished by St.

A Saxon form of greeting, mean-
ing peace and safety.

## SYLLABUS

An abstract; a headnote; a note
prefixed to the report of an adjudged case, con-
taining an epitome or brief statement of the rul-
ings of the court upon the point or points decided
in the case. In West Virginia it is the law of the
case, whatever may be the reasoning employed in
the opinion of the court. Kuhn v. Coal Co., 215
U.S. 356, 30 S.Ct. 140, 141, 54 L.Ed. 228. The syl-
labus, however, in that state, is never made up of
finding of facts, but is limited to points of law de-
termined. Sometimes the finding of facts is re-
ferred to for the purpose of explaining the point
of law adjudicated, but only for that purpose.
Koonce v. Doolittle, 48 W.Va. 592, 37 S.E. 644, 645.
Likewise in Ohio, the authority of decisions of its
Supreme Court is limited to points stated in the
syllabus. Walsh v. E. G. Shinner & Co., C.C.A.
Del., DLO F.2d 586, 588. But ordinarily, where a
headnote, even though prepared by the court, is
given no special force by statute or rule of court,
the opinion is to be looked to for the original and
authentic statement of the grounds of decision.
Burbank v. Ernst, 232 U.S. 162, 34 S.Ct. 299, 58
L.Ed. 551.
Also, a catalogue or list; specifically (capital-
ized), a collection of eighty condemned proposi-
tions addressed by Pope Pius IX to all the Catholic
episcopate, December 8, 1864. It gave rise to the
most violent polemics; the Ultramontane party
was loud in its praise, while the liberals treated
it as &declaration of war by the church on modern
society and civilization. Encycl. Br.

## SYLLOGISM

In logic. The full logical form of
a single argument. It consists of three proposi-

## SYMBOLZEOGRAPHY

The art or cunning right-
ly to form and make written instruments. It is
either judicial or extrajudicial; the latter being
wholly occupied with such instruments as con-
cern matters not yet judicially in controversy,
such as instruments of agreements or contracts,

## SYMBOLIC DELIVERY

The constructive deliv-
ery of the subject-matter of a sale or gift, where
it is cumbersome or inaccessible, by the actual
delivery of some article which is conventionally
accepted as the symbol or representative of it,
or which renders access to it possible, or which
is evidence of the purchaser's or donee's title to
it. Thus, a present gift of the contents of a box
in a bank vault, accompanied by a transfer of the
key thereto, is valid as a symbolical delivery. In
re Leadenham's Estate, 289 Pa. 216, 137 A. 247,
SYMBOLUM ANIMIE. Lat. A mortuary, or soul
scot. See Soul Scot.

## SYMMETRY

Due proportion of several parts of
a body to each other; adaptation of the form or
dimensions of the several parts of a thing to each
other; harmonious relation of parts; conform-
ance; consistency; congruity; correspondence or
similarity of form, dimensions, or parts on op-
posite sides of an axis, center, or a dividing plane.

In English common law. An agent appointed
by a corporation for the purpose of obtaining
letters of guardianship and the like, to whom such

In French law. The person who is commis-
sioned by the courts to administer a bankruptcy.
He fulfills the same functions as the trustee or as-
signee. Also, one who is chosen to conduct the

porate or community. In this sense the word
corresponds to director or manager. Rodman
Notes to Code de Com. p. 351; Dalloz, Dict. Syn-
dic. See Field v. United States, 9 Pet. 182, 9 L.Ed.
In Louisiana. The assignee of a bankrupt. Al-
so, one of several persons to be elected by the

will accept the administration and give the se-
curity required. Civ.Code. La. art. 1224.
'SYNDICALISM. The theory, plan, or practice of

timately at the control of society and govern-
ment, by the federated bodies of industrial work-
ers, and which seeks to realize its purposes
through the agency of general strikes and of ter-
rorism, sabotage, violence, or other criminal
means. New Cent. Dict.
Criminal Syndicalism

ing, or aiding and abetting the commission of
crime, sabotage (defined in the act as willful and
malicious physical damage or injury to physical
property), or unlawful acts of force and violence

SYNGRAPIL The name given by the canonists
to deeds or other written instruments of which
both parts were written on the same piece of
parchment, with some word or letters of the al-
phabet written between them, through which the
parchment was cut in such a manner' as to leave
half the word on one part and half on the other.
It thus corresponded to the chirograph or inden-
ture of the common law. 2 Bl.Comm. 295, 296.
Formerly such writings were attested by the subscrip-
tion and crosses of the witnesses; afterwards, to prevent
frauds and concealments, they made deeds of mutual , cove-
nant in a script and rescript, or in a part and counterpart,
and in the middle between the two copies they wrote the
word syngraphus in large letters, which, being cut through
the parchment and one being delivered to each party, on
being afterwards put together proved their authenticity.
A deed, bond, or other written instrument under
the hand and seal of all the parties. It was so
called because the parties wrote together.
