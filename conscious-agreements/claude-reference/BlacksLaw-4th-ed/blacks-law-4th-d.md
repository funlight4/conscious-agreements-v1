## DAMAGE

Loss, injury, or deterioration, caused
by the negligence, design, or accident of one per-
son to another, in respect of the latter's person
or property. The word is to be distinguished from
its plural,-"damages,"-which means a compen-
sation in money for a loss or damage. An injury
produces a right in them who have suffered any
damage by it to demand reparation of such dam-
age from the authors of the injury. By damage,
we understand every loss or diminution of what
is a man's own, occasioned by the fault of anoth-
er. 1 Ruth. Inst. 399.

son of an injury. Yazoo & M. V. R. Co. v. Fields,

## DAMAGE-CLEER

A fee assessed of the tenth
part in the common pleas, and the twentieth part
in the queen's bench and exchequer, out of all
damages exceeding five marks recovered in those
courts, in actions upon the case, covenant, tres-
pass, etc., wherein the damages were uncertain;
which the plaintiff was obliged to pay to the pro-
thonotary or the officer of the court wherein he
recovered, before he could have execution for the
damages. This was originally a gratuity given to
the prothonotaries and their clerks for drawing
special writs and pleadings; but it was taken
away by statute, since which, if any officer in
these courts took any money in the name of dam-
age-deer, or anything in lieu thereof, he forfeited
treble the value. Wharton.
DAMAGE FEASANT or FAISANT. Doing dam-
age. A term applied to a person's cattle or beasts
found upon another's land, doing damage by tread-
ing down the grass, grain, etc. 3 Bl. Comm. 7,
211; Tomlins. This phrase seems to have been
introduced in the reign of Edward III, in place of
the older expression "en son damage," (in damno
suo.) Crabb, Eng. Law, 292.

jury directly resulting from wrongful act, wheth-
er lying in trespass or trespass on the case, and

Wis. 494, 173 N.W. 325, 327.

S.Ct. 265, 41 L.Ed. 632; Wainscott v. Loan Ass'n,

by a jury on finding for the plaintiff or successful party in
an action, as a compensation for the injury done him by
the opposite party. 2 BI.Comm. 438; Co.Litt. 257a; 2
Tidd, Pr. 869, 870. In its early signification the term in-
cluded "costs", the terms are now regarded as distinct,
State ex rel. Marcri v. City of Bremerton, 8 Wash.2d 93,

11, 41 P.2d 680, 682; "judgment", Stearns v. Ritchie, 128
Me. 368, 147 A. 703, 705. In the ancient usage, the word
"damages" was employed in two significations. According
to Coke, its proper and general sense included the costs of
suit, while its strict or relative sense was exclusive of costs.
10 Coke, 116, 117; Co.Litt. 257a; 9 East, 299. The latter
meaning has alone survived.

113 Iowa 107, 84 N.W. 982.
Compensatory damages

pensate the injured party for the injury sustain-
ed, and nothing more; such as will simply make
good or replace the loss caused by the wrong or
injury. McKnight v. Denny, 198 Pa. 323, 47 A.
970; Wade v. Power Co., 51 S.C. 296, 29 S.E. 233,
64 Am.St.Rep. 676; Gatzow v. Buening, 106 Wis.
1, 81 N.W. 1003, 49 L.R.A. 475.
Consequential damages
Such damage, loss, or injury as does not flow

sults of such act. Swain v. Copper Co., 111 Tenn.

cago, B. & Q. R. Co., C.C.A.Minn., 82 F.2d 131,
136, 106 A.L.R. 942.
The term means sometimes damage which is so remote
as not to be actionable; sometimes damage which, though
somewhat remote, is actionable; or damage which, though
actionable, does not follow immediately, in point of time,
upon the doing of the act complained of. Eaton v. Rail-
road Co., 51 N.H. 504, 12 Am.Rep. 147.
Contingent damages
Where a demurrer has been filed to one or more
counts in a declaration, and its consideration is

ages."

from the repetition of similar acts, between two
specified periods of time.

Additional damages claimed by a plaintiff not
satisfied with those paid into court by the defend-

114 Ind. 340, 16 N.E. 787.
Exemplary damages
Exemplary damages are damages on an in-
creased scale, awarded to the plaintiff over and
above what will barely compensate him for his
property loss, where the wrong done to him was
aggravated by circumstances of violence, oppres-
sion, malice, fraud, or wanton and wicked conduct
on the part of the defendant, and are intended to
solace the plaintiff for mental anguish, laceration
of his feelings, shame, degradation, or other ag-
gravations of the original wrong, or else to pun-
ish the defendant for his evil behavior or to make
an example of him, for which reason they are
also called "punitive" or "punitory" damages or
"vindictive" damages, and (vulgarly) "smart-mon-
ey." Springer v. Fuel Co., 196 Pa.St. 156, 46 A.
370; Scott v. Donald, 165 .U.S. 58, 17 S.Ct. 265, 41

7 Colo. 541, 5 P. 119, 49 Am.Rep. 366. It is said
that the idea of punishment does not enter into
the definition; the term being employed to mean
an increased award in view of supposed aggrava-
tion of the injury to the feelings of plaintiff by the
wanton or reckless act of defendant. Brause v.
Brause, 190 Iowa 329, 177 N.W. 65, 70.
Fair damages
See Fair Damages.
Fee damages
Damages sustained by and awarded to an abut-
ting owner of real property occasioned by the
construction and operation of an elevated rail-

v. Barker, 165 N.Y. 305, 59 N.E. 151.
General damages
General damages are such as the law itself
implies or presumes to have accrued from the
wrong complained of, for the reason that they
are its immediate, direct, and proximate result,
or such as necessarily result from the injury, or
such as did in fact result from the wrong, directly
and proximately, and without reference to the
special character, condition, or circumstances of
the plaintiff. Mood v. Telegraph Co., 40 S.C. 524,
19 S.E. 67; Hopkins v. Veo, 98 Vt. 433, 129 A. 157,
158; United States Frumentum Co. v. Lauhoff,

"exemplary," "vindictive," or "punitive" damages.
Murphy v. Hobbs, 7 Colo. 541, 5 P. 119, 49 Am.
Rep. 366.
Inadequate damages
Damages are called "inadequate," within the
rule that an injunction will not be granted where
adequate damages at law could be recovered for
the injury sought to be prevented, when such a
recovery at law would not compensate the par-
ties and place them in the position in which they
formerly stood. Insurance Co. v. Bonner, 7 Colo.
App. 97, 42 P. 681.
Intervening damages
Such damages to an appellee as result from the
delay caused by the appeal. McGregor v. Balch,
17 Vt. 568; Roberts v. Warner, 17 Vt. 46, 42 Am.

Krich v. Zemel, 96 N.J.Eq. 208, 124 A. 449, 450.
With reference to public nuisances which a pri-
vate party may enjoin, the term includes wrongs
of a repeated and continuing character, or which
occasion damages estimable only by conjecture,
and not by any accurate standard. Bernard v.
Willamette Box & Lumber Co., 64 Or. 223, 129 P.
1039, 1042.
Land damages
A term sometimes applied to the amount of
compensation to be paid for land taken under
the power of eminent domain or for injury to, or
depreciation of, land adjoining that taken. Peo-
ple v. Hilts, 27 Misc.Rep. 290, 58 N.Y.S. 434; In re
Lent, 47 App.Div. 349, 62 N.Y.S. 227.
Liquidated damages and penalties
The term is applicable when the amount of the
damages has been ascertained by the judgment in
the action, or when a specific sum of money has
been expressly stipulated by the parties to a bond
or other contract as the amount of damages to be
recovered by either party for a breach of the
agreement by the other. Keeble v. Keeble, 85 Ala.
552, 5 So. 149; Eakin v. Scott, 70 Tex. 442, 7 S.W.
777; Cochrane v. Forbes, 267 Mass. 417, 166 N.E.
752, 753; Varno v. Tindall, 164 Tenn. 642, 51 S.W.
2d 502, 503; Norwood Morris Plan Co. v. Mc-
Carthy, 295 Mass. 597, 4 N.E.2d 450, 454, 107 A.L.
R. 1215; Factory Realty Corporation v. Corbin-
Holmes Shoe Co., 312 Mass. 325, 44 N.E.2d 671,
674. The purpose of a penalty is to secure per-
formance, while the purpose of stipulating dam-
ages is to fix the amount to be paid in lieu of per-
formance. Christianson v. Haugland, 163 Minn. 73,
203 N.W. 433, 434; Davidow v. Wadsworth Mfg.
Co., 211 Mich. 90, 178 N.W. 776, 777, 12 A.L.R.
605; Forsyth v. Central Foundry Co., 240 Ala.
277, 198 So. 706, 710. The essence of a penalty is
a stipulation as in terrorem while the essence of
liquidated damages is a genuine covenanted pre-
estimate of such damages. Shields v. Early, 132
Miss. 282, 95 So. 839, 840. For other cases per-
taining to the distinction between a penalty and
liquidated damages, see Fiscal Court of Franklin
County v. Kentucky Public Service Co., 181 Ky.
245, 204 S.W. 77, 79; In re Liberty Doll Co., D.C.
N.Y., 242 F. 695, 701; Miller v. Blockberger, 111
Ohio St. 798, 146 N.E. 206, 209; Armstrong v. Ir-
win, 26 Ariz. 1, 221 P. 222, 225, 32 A.L.R. 609.
Necessary damages
A term said to be of much wider scope in the
law of damages than "pecuniary." It embraces
all those consequences of an injury usually de-
nominated "general" damages, as distinguished
from special damages; whereas the phrase "pe-
cuniary damages" covers a smaller class of dam-
ages within the larger class of "general" damages.
Browning v. Wabash Western R. Co., Mo., 24 S.
W. 746.
Nominal damages
Nominal damages are a trifling sum awarded
to a plaintiff in an action, where there is no sub-
stantial loss or injury to be compensated, but
still the law recognizes a technical invasion of
his rights or a breach of the defendant's duty, or
in cases where, although there has been a real
injury, the plaintiff's evidence entirely fails to
show its amount. Seeling v. Missouri, K. & T. Ry.
Co., 287 Mo. 343, 230 S.W. 94, 102; City of Rainier
v. Masters, 79 Or. 534, 155 P. 1197, 1198, L.R.A.
1916E, 1175; Springer v. Fuel Co., 196 Pa. 156, 46
A. 370.
Pecuniary damages
Such as can be estimated in and compensated
by money; not merely the loss of money or sal-
able property or rights, but all such loss, depriva-
tion, or injury as can be made the subject of cal:
culation and of recompense in money. Walker v.
McNeill, 17 Wash. 582, 50 P. 518; Davidson Bene-
dict Co. v. Severson, 109 Tenn. 572, 72 S.W. 967.
Permanent damages
Damages awarded on theory that cause of in-
jury is fixed and that the property will always
remain subject to it. Chambers v. Spruce Light-
ing Co., 81 W.Va. 714, 95 S.E. 192, 194.
Presumptive damages
A term occasionally used as the equivalent of
"exemplary" or "punitive" damages. Murphy v.
Hobbs, 7 Colo. 541, 5 P. 119, 49 Am.Rep. 366.
Prospective damages
Damages which are expected to follow from
the act or state of facts made the basis of a plain-
tiff's suit; damages which have not yet accrued,
at the time of the trial, but which, in the nature
of things, must necessarily, or most probably, re-
sult from the acts or facts complained of.
Proximate damages
Proximate damages are the immediate and di-
rect damages and natural results of the act com-
plained of, and such as are usual and might have
been expected. Remote damages are those at-
tributable immediately to an intervening cause,
though it forms a link in an unbroken chain of
causation, so that the remote damage would not
have occurred if its elements had not been set
in motion by the original act or event. Pielke v.
Railroad Co., 5 Dak. 444, 41 N.W. 669; Chambers
v. Everding & Farrell, 71 Or. 521, 143 P. 616, 619.
Remote damages
The unusual and unexpected result, not reason-
ably to be anticipated from an accidental or un-
usual combination of circumstances-a result be-
Chambers v. Everding & Farrel, 71 Or. 521, 143
P. 616, 620.
Damage is said to be too remote to be action-
able when it is not the legal and natural conse-
quence of the act complained of.
The terms "remote damages" and "consequential dam-
ages" are not synonymous nor to be used interchangeably;
all remote damage is consequential, but it is by no means
true that all consequential damage is remote. Eaton v.
Railroad Co., 51 N.H. 511, 12 Am.Rep. 147; Chambers v.
Everding & Farrell, 71 Or. 521, 143 P. 616, 620.
Special damages
Those which are the actual, but not the neces-
sary, result of the injury complained of, and
which in fact follow it as a natural and proximate
consequence in the particular case, that is, by
reason of special circumstances or conditions.
Wallace v. Ah Sam, 71 Cal. 197, 12 P. 46, 60 Am.
Rep. 534; Lawrence v. Porter, C.C.A.Mich., 63 F.
62, 11 C.C.A. 27, 26 L.R.A. 167; Huyler's v. Ritz-
Carlton Restaurant & Hotel Co. of Atlantic City,
D.C.Del., 6 F.2d 404, 406. Those which are the
natural, but not the necessary, result of the in-
jury. Butte Floral Co. v. Reed, 65 Mont. 138, 211
P. 325, 330; Ralph N. Blakeslee Co. v. Rigo, 94
Conn. 481, 109 A. 173,175; Erick Bowman Remedy
Co. v. Jensen Salsbery Laboratories, C.C.A.Minn.,
17 F.2d 255, 259, 52 A.L.R. 1187.
Speculative damages
Prospective or anticipated damages from the
same acts or facts constituting the present cause
of action, but which depend upon future develop-
ments which are contingent, conjectural, or im-
probable.
Substantial damages
A sum, assessed by way of damages, which is
worth having; opposed to nominal damages,
which are assessed to satisfy a bare legal right.
Wharton. Considerable in amount and intended
as a real compensation for a real injury.
Temporary damages
Damages allowed for intermittent and occa-
sional wrongs, such as injuries to real estate,
where cause thereof is removable or abatable.
Chambers v. Spruce Lighting Co., 81 W.Va. 714,
95 S.E. 192, 194.
Unliquidated damages
Such as are not yet reduced to a certainty in
respect of amount, nothing more being estab-
lished than the plaintiff's right to recover; or
such as cannot be fixed by a mere mathematical
calculation from ascertained data in the case.
Cox v. McLaughlin, 76 Cal. 60, 18 P. 100, 9 Am.
St.Rep. 164; Cook Pottery Co. v. Parker, 86 W.

& Trust Co. v. Fidelity, etc., Co., 203 Pa. 82, 52 A.

from fate; loss happening from a cause beyond
human control, (quod ex fato contingit,) or an act
shipwreck, lightning, and the like. Dig. 4, 9, 3, 1;
Story, Bailm. § 465. The civilians included in the
phrase "damnum fatale" all those accidents which
are summed up in the common-law expression,

it embraced some which would not now be admit-
ted as occurring from an irresistible force. Thick-
stun v. Howard, 8 Blackf. Ind. 535.

## DAMNUM INFECTUM

Danish pirates, who greatly annoyed their coasts,
or to buy off the ravages of Danish invaders. It
continued a tax until the time of Stephen, and was
one of the rights of the crown. Wharton; Web-
ster, Dict. The Danegeld was levied as a land-
tax by the Norman kings; it disappears under
that name after 1163, but in fact continued under
the name of tallage. 3 New English Dict. 26.

## DANELAGE

the Danes on their invasion and conquest of Eng-
land, which was principally maintained in some

345 Mo. 185, 132 S.W.2d 501, 506.

## DANGER ZONE

The "danger zone" within con-
templation of the humanitarian doctrine depends
upon the facts in the particular case. Brown v.
Alton R. Co., Mo.App., 132 S.W.2d 713, 727; Brown
v. Alton R. Co., 236 Mo.App. 26, 151 S.W.2d 727,

the sea." See Dangers of the sea, infra.
Dangers of the River
This phrase, as used in bills of lading, means
only the natural accidents incident to river navi-
gation, and does not embrace such as may be
avoided by the exercise of that skill, judgment, or
foresight which are demanded from persons in a
particular occupation. Hill v. Sturgeon, 35 Mo.
213, 86 Am.Dec. 149. It includes dangers arising
from unknown reefs which have suddenly formed
in the channel, and are not discoverable by care
and skill. Hill v. Sturgeon, 35 Mo. 213, 86 Am.
Dec. 149; Hibernia Ins. Co. v. Transp. Co., 120 U.

Dangers of the Sea
The expression "dangers of the sea" means
those accidents peculiar to navigation that are of
an extraordinary nature, or arise from irresistible
force or overwhelming power, which cannot be
guarded against by the ordinary exertions of hu-
man skill and prudence. The Portsmouth, 9 Wall.
682, 19 L.Ed. 754; Hibernia Ins. Co. v. Transp. Co.,
120 U.S. 166, 7 S.Ct. 550, 30 L.Ed. 621; The Mau-
mee, D.C.N.C., 260 F. 862, 870; equivalent to
"dangers of navigation." Norris Grain Co. v.
Great Lakes Transit Corporation, C.C.A.I11., 70 F.
2d 32, 34.

494, 90 S.E. 521, 522; King v. Smythe, 140 Tenn.
217, 204 S.W. 296, 297, L.R.A.1918F, 293; Bentson

siderable risk, or danger, or peril, one where ac-
cidents or injuries are very apt to occur. Henrie
v. Rocky Mountain Packing Corp., Utah, 196 P.2d
487, 489.

## DANGEROUS WEAPON

One dangerous to life;
one by the use of which a fatal wound may prob-
ably or possibly be given. As the manner of use
enters into the consideration as well as other cir-
cumstances, the question is often one of fact for
the jury, but not infrequently one of law for the
court. U. S. v. Reeves, C.C.Tex., 38 F. 404; Par-
man v. Lemmon, 119 Kan. 323, 244 P. 227, 229, 44

when made donandi animo, from mere liberality,
it is a gift, dono datio.

## DARE AD REMANENTIAM

fee, or forever.

## DARRAIGN

## DASH

The em dash (-) or the en dash (-) is
often used to indicate the omission of the inter-
mediate terms of a series which are to be supplied
in reading, being thus often equivalent to * * *
inclusive; thus Mark iv, 3-20 (that is, verses 3
to 20, inclusive) ; the years 1880-1888 (that is,
1880 to 1888). Booe v. Sims, 139 Ark. 595, 215
S.W. 659, 660.

## DATA

In old practice and conveyancing. The
date of a deed; the time when it was given; that
is, executed. Grounds whereon to proceed; facts
from which to draw a conclusion.

## DATE

The specification or mention, in a written
instrument, of the time (day, month and year)
when it was made. Also the time so specified.
Interior Linseed Co. v. Becker-Moore Paint Co.,
273 Mo. 433, 202 S.W. 566, 569; In re Carpenter's
Estate, 172 Cal. 268, 156 P. 464, 465, L.R.A.1916E,
498; State v. Beckley, 192 Wis. 367, 212 N.W. 792,
793; Heller v. Sweeney, 101 N.J.Eq. 150, 135 A.
264, 265.
The word is derived from the Latin word "da-
tum" meaning given and is defined as the time
given or specified-in some way ascertained and
fixed. The time when an instrument was made,
acknowledged, delivered or recorded; the clause
or memorandum which specifies that fact; and
the time from which its operation is to be reckon-
ed. In re Irvine's Estate, 114 Mont. 577, 139 P.2d
489, 490, 491, 47 A.L.R. 882.
That part of a deed or writing which expresses
the day of the month and year in which it was
made or given. 2 Bl.Comm. 304; Tomlins.
The primary signification of date is not time in
the abstract, nor time taken absolutely, but time
given or specified; time in some way ascertained
and fixed. When we speak of the date of a deed,
date of issue of a bond or date of a policy, we do
not mean the time when it was actually executed,
but the time of its execution, as given or stated in
the deed itself. The date of an item, or of a
charge in a book-account, is not necessarily the
time when the article charged was, in fact, fur-
nished, but rather the time given or set down in
the account, in connection with such charge. And
so the expression "the date of the last work done,
or materials furnished," in a mechanic's lien law,
may be taken, in the absence of anything in the
act indicating a different intention, to mean the
time when such work was done or materials fur-
nished, as specified in the plaintiff's written claim.
Bement v. Manufacturing Co., 32 N.J.Law, 513;
Mutual Life Ins. Co. of New York v. Hurni Pack-
ing Co., 263 U.S. 167, 44 S.Ct. 90, 68 L.Ed. 235, 31
A.L.R. 102; Mutual Life Ins. Co. of New York v.
Hurni Packing Co., C.C.A.Iowa, 280 F. 18, 20;
Turner v. Roseberry Irr. Dist., 33 Idaho, 746, 198
P. 465, 467.
The precise meaning of date, however, depends upon
context, since there are numerous instances when it means
actual as distinguished from conventional time. Buck-
hannon & N. R. Co. v. Great Scott Coal & Coke Co., 75 W.
Va. 423, 83 S.E. 1031, 1033; London Guarantee & Accident
Co. v. Empire Plow Co., 115 Ohio St. 684, 155 N.E. 382, 384;
National Liberty Ins. Co. v. Norman, C.C.A.N.C., 11 F.2d
59, 61; Cantrell v. Prudential Ins. Co. of America, 189
Wash. 99, 63 P.2d 509, 510.

## DATE CERTAINE

In French law. A deed is
said to have a date certaine (fixed date) when it
tion; after this formality has been complied with,
the parties to the deed cannot by mutual consent
change the date thereof. Arg. Fr. Merc. Law, 555.

## DATE OF INJURY

Means inception date of the
injury and is regarded as coincident with date of
occurrence or happening of accident which caused
such injury. Indemnity Ins. Co. of North America
v. Williams, 129 Tex. 51, 99 S.W.2d 905, 907; As-
sociated Indemnity Corporation v. State Industrial
Accident Commission, 124 Cal.App. 378, 12 P.2d
1075, 1076; Larson v. Industrial Commission, 224
Wis. 294, 271 N.W. 835, 836. Date of the compen-
sable injury and not date of accident or occur-
rence from which incapacity resulted. Rossi V.
Thomas F. Jackson Co., 120 Conn. 456, 181 A. 539.
"DATE OF ISSUE." When applied to notes, bonds,
etc., of series, usually means an arbitrary date
fixed as beginning of term for which they run,
without reference to precise time when conven-
ience or state of market may permit their sale or
delivery, date which bonds and stocks bear, and
not date when they were actually issued in sense
of being signed and delivered and put into circula-
tion. Whetstone v. City of Stuttgart, 193 Ark.
88, 97 S.W.2d 641, 643.
The words in life policy were held not to mean
the date of actual execution or the delivery date,
but the date set forth in the policy itself. Potts
v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 133 Pa.Super. 397,
2 A.2d 870, 872.

## DATIO

In the civil law. A giving, or act of giv-
ing. Datio in solutum; a giving in payment; a
species of accord and satisfaction. Called, in_
modern law, "dation."
DATION. In the civil law. A gift; a giving of
something. It is not exactly synonymous with
"donation," for the latter implies generosity or
liberality in making a gift, while dation may mean
the giving of something to which the recipient is
already entitled.

## DATION EN PAIEMENT

In French law. A
giving by the debtor and receipt by the creditor of
something in payment of a debt, instead of a sum
of money. It is somewhat like the accord and
satisfaction of the common law. 16 Toullier, no.
45; Poth. Vente, no. 601.

## DATIVE

A word derived from the Roman law,
signifying "appointed by public authority." Thus,
in Scotland, an executor-dative is an executor ap-
pointed by a court; corresponding or equivalent
to an English administrator or "administrator
with the will annexed." Mozley & Whitley. In old
English law. In one's gift; that may be given and
disposed of at will and pleasure.

## DATUM

A first principle; a thing given; a date.

## DATUR DIGNIORI

It is given to the more
worthy. 2 Vent. 268.

clude the issue of a daughter. Buchanan v. Lloyd,
88 Md. 462, 41 A. 1075; Jamison v. Hay, 46 Mo.
546. May designate a natural or illegitimate fe-
male child, State v. Laurence, 95 N.C. 659, not an

7. The period of time, within the limits of a
natural day, set apart either by law or by com-
mon usage for the transaction of particular busi-

word "day" may signify six, eight, ten, or any
number of hours. Fay v. Brown, 96 Wis. 434, 71

## DE DEBITO

A writ of debt. Reg. Orig. 139.

## DE DEBITORE IN PARTES SECANDO

In Ro-
man law. "Of cutting a debtor in pieces." This
was the name of a law contained in the Twelve
Tables, the meaning of which has occasioned
much controversy. Some commentators have con-
cluded that it was literally the privilege of the
creditors of an insolvent debtor (all other means
failing) to cut his body into pieces and distribute
it among them. Others contend that the language
of this law must be taken figuratively, denoting a
cutting up and apportionment of the debtor's es-
tate.
The latter view has been adopted by Montesquieu, Bynk-
ershoek, Heineccius, and Taylor. (Esprit des Lois, liv. 29,
c. 2; Bynk.Obs.Jur.Rom. 1. 1, c. 1; Heinecc.Ant.Rom. lib.
3, tit. 30, § 4; Tayl.Comm. in Leg.Decemv.) The literal
meaning, on the other hand, is advocated by Aulus Gellius
and other writers of antiquity, and receives support from
an expression (semoto omni cruciatu) in the Roman code
itself. (Aul.Gel.Noctes Attica, lib. 20, c. 1; Code, 7, 7, 8.)
This is also the opinion of Gibbon, Gravina, Pothier, Hugo,
and Niebuhr. (3 Gib.Rom.Emp., Am.Ed., p. 183; Gray. de
Jur.Nat.Gent. et XII. Tab. § 72; Poth.Introd.Pand.;
Hugo, Hist. du Droit Rom. tom. p. 233, § 149; 2 Nieb.
Hist.Rom. p. 597; 1 Kent, Comm. 523, note.) Burrill.

## DE DONIS

Concerning gifts, (or more fully, de
donis conditionalibus, concerning conditional
gifts.) The name of a celebrated English statute,
passed in the thirteenth year of Edw. I., and con-
stituting the first chapter of the statute of Westm.
2, by virtue of which estates in fee-simple con-
ditional (formerly known as "dona conditionalia")
were converted into estates in fee-tail and ren-
dered inalienable, thereby strengthening the pow-
er of the nobles. See 2 Bl.Comm. 112.

reversioner, remainderman, or stranger who had
himself deprived the tenant of the occupation of
the land during his term. 3 Bl.Comm. 199. By
a gradual extension of the scope of this form of
action its object was made to include not only
damages for the unlawful detainer, but also the
possession for the remainder of the term, and
eventually the possession of land generally. And,
as it turned on the right of possession, this in-
volved a determination of the right of property,
or the title, and thus arose the modern action of
ejectment.
DE ESC2ETA. Writ of escheat. A writ which
a lord had, where his tenant died without heir, to
recover the land. Reg. Orig. 164b; Fitzh. Nat.

## DE ESCAMBIO MONET/E

## DE FACTO

In fact, in deed, actually. This
phrase is used to characterize an officer, a govern-
ment, a past action, or a state of affairs which
must be accepted for all practical purposes, but is
illegal or illegitimate. In this sense it is the con-
trary of de jure, which means rightful, legitimate,
just, or constitutional. Thus, an officer, king, or
government de facto is one who is in actual pos-
session of the office or supreme power, but by
usurpation, or without lawful title; while an offi-
cer, king, or governor de jure is one who has just
claim and rightful title to the office or power, but
has never had plenary possession of it, or is not in
actual possession. 4 Bl.Comm. 77, 78. MacLeod v.
United States, 229 U.S. 416, 33 S.Ct. 955, 57 L.Ed.
1260; Wheatley v. Consolidated Lumber Co., 167
Cal. 441, 139 P. 1057, 1059. So a wife de facto is
one whose marriage is voidable by decree, as dis-
tinguished from a wife de jure, or lawful wife. 4
Kent, Comm. 36. But the term is also frequently
used independently of any distinction from de
jure; thus a blockade de facto is a blockade which
is actually maintained, as distinguished from a
mere paper blockade. 1 Kent, 44. As to de facto
"Corporation," "Court," "Domicile," "Govern-
ment," and "Officer," see those titles.
In old English law it means respecting or con-
cerning the principal act of a murder, which was
technically denominated factum. See Fleta, lib. 1,
c. 27, § 18.

## DE FACTO CONTRACT

One which has purport-
ed to pass the property from the owner to an-
. other. Bank v. Logan, 74 N.Y. 575; Edmunds v..
Transp. Co., 135 Mass. 283.

## DE FAIRE ECHELLE

commonly inserted in policies of marine insurance,
equivalent to a license to touch and trade at in-
termediate ports. American Ins. Co. v. Griswold,
DE FALSO JUDICIO. Writ of false judgment.
Reg.Orig. 15; Fitzh.Nat.Brev. 18. See False Judg-
ment.

## DE FALSO MONETA

Of false money. The
title of the statute 27 Edw. I. ordaining that per-
sons importing certain coins, called "pollards,"
and "crokards," should forfeit their lives and
goods, and everything they could forfeit. 2 Reeve,
Eng.Law, 228, 229.
DE FIDE ET OFFICIO JUDICIS NON RECIPI-
TUR QUIESTIO, SED DE SCIENTIA, SIVE SIT
ERROR JURIS, SIVE FACTI. Concerning the
fidelity and official conduct of a judge, no question
is Lwill, be] entertained; but [only] concerning his
knowledge, whether the error [committed] be of
law or of fact. Bac.Max. 68, reg. 17. The bona
fides and honesty of purpose of a judge cannot
be questioned, but his decision may be impugned
for error either of law or fact. Broom, Max, 85.
The law doth so much respect the certainty of
judgments, and the credit and authority of judges,
that it will not permit any error to be assigned
which impeacheth them in their trust and office,
and in willful abuse of the same; but only in ig-
norance and mistaking either of the law, or of the
case and matter of fact. Bac.Max. ubi supra.
Thus, it cannot be assigned for error that a judge
did that which he ought not to do; as that he
entered a verdict for the plaintiff, where the jury
gave it for the defendant. Fitzh.Nat.Brev. 20, 21;
Bac.Max. ubi supra; Hardr. 127, arg.

fidelity. 4 Reeve, Eng.Law, 99.

thereof. 2 Reeve, Eng.Law, 290; 2 Inst. 589.

"of our special grace, certain knowledge, and
mere motion," is of no avail in those things in
which it is presumed that the prince was ignorant.

Comm. 129. This writ has been superseded al-
most wholly, in modern practice, by that of ha-
beas corpus; but it is still used, in some of the
states, in an amended and altered form. See 1
Kent, Comm. 404n; 34 Me. 136.

complained of, but alleges, in his plea, certain new
matter by way of justification or excuse; by this
replication the plaintiff avers that the defendant
committed the grievances in question "of his own
wrong, and without any such cause," or motive or
excuse, as that alleged in the plea, (de injuria sua
propria absque tali causa;) or, admitting part
of the matter pleaded, "without the rest of the
cause" alleged, (absque residuo causce.) In form
it is a species of traverse, and it is frequently
used when the pleading of the defendant, in an-
swer to which it is directed, consists merely of
matter of excuse of the alleged trespass, griev-
ance, breach of contract, or other cause of action.
Its comprehensive character in putting in issue
all the material facts of the defendant's plea has
also obtained for it the title of the general replica-
tion. Holthouse.

ter means "by equity." See Government.

A.L.R. 1500; People v. Dwyer, 324 Ill. 363, 155
N.E. 316, 317.
The term may denote any instrument so used as to be
likely to produce death or great bodily harm, and hence
may include an automobile, especially within the meaning
of statutes pertaining to assault. Williamson v. State, 92
Fla. 980, 111 So. 124, 125, 53 A.L.R. 250. But an automo-
bile, when used innocently or negligently so as to be like-
ly to produce death or bodily injury, or to actually pro-
duce them without criminal liability, has been held not to
be a deadly weapon within the meaning of the criminal
law. People v. Cash, 326 Ill. 104, 157 N.E. 76, 79; State
v. Clark, 196 Iowa, 1134, 196 N.W. 82, 84.

## DEADLY WEAPON PER SE

A weapon which of
itself is deadly or one which would ordinarily re-
sult in death by its use. Baylor v. State, 151 Tex.

## DEAF AND DUMB

A man that is born deaf,
dumb, and blind is looked upon by the law as in
the same state with an idiot, he being supposed
incapable of any understanding. 1 Bl. Comm.
304. See, however, Alexier v. Matzke, 151 Mich.
36, 115 N.W. 251, 123 Am.St.Rep. 255. Neverthe-
less, a deaf and dumb person may be tried for
felony if the prisoner can be made to understand
by means of signs. 1 Bish. Cr. L. § 395; Com-
monwealth v. Hill, 14 Mass. 207; State v. Harris,
53 N.C. 136, 78 Am.Dec. 272; 1 Houst.Cr.Rep. 291;

any kind between them, and when applied to a transaction
concerning a house or block, the term does not necessarily

v. Morro, 313 Mo. 114, 280 S.W. 697, 699.
To "deal" in a commodity, however, such as automobiles,
within the meaning of a privilege tax statute, means some-
thing more than the making of an occasional sale in a mu-
nicipality where the seller has no place of business, and no
stock ,of automobiles on hand. City of Pascagoula v.
Carter, 136 Miss. 750, 101 So. 687, 688.

ly,-one who is ready and willing to sell to anyone apply-
ing to purchase, if unaware that they are officers or under-

siastical dignitary who presides over the chapter
of a cathedral, and is next in rank to the bishop.
So called from having been originally appointed
to superintend ten canons or prebendaries. 1 Bl.
Comm, 382; Co, Litt, 95; Spelman.
There are several kinds of deans, namely: Deans of
chapters; deans of peculiars; rural deans; deans in the
colleges; honorary deans; deans of provinces.

## DEAN AND CHAPTER

The council of a bishop, to assist him with their
advice in the religious and also in the temporal
affairs of the see. 3 Co, 75; 1 Bla. Comm. 382;
Co. Litt 103, 300; Termes de la Ley; 2 Burn, Eccl,

## DEATH

The cessation of life; the ceasing to
exist; defined by physicians as a total stoppage
of the circulation of the blood, and a cessation of
the animal and vital functions consequent there-
on, such as respiration, pulsation, etc.
This is "natural death," in contradistinction to "civil
death," and, also, to "violent death," See those titles,
infra.
Civil death. The state of a person who, though
possessing natural life, has lost all his civil rights,
and as to them, is considered as dead. Quick v.
Western Ry. of Alabama, 207 Ala. 376, 92 So,
608, 609. At common law, the extinction of civil
rights and relations, so that the property of a
person declared civilly dead passes to his heirs
113 So. 274, 276.
The "civil death" spoken of In the books, is of two
kinds : (1) Where there is a total extinction of the civil
rights and relations of the party, so that he can neither
take nor hold property, and his heirs succeed to his estate
in the same manner as if he were really dead, or the estate
is forfeited to the crown. (2) Where there is an incapacity
to hold property, or to sue in the king's courts, attended
with forfeiture of the estate to the crown. Of the first
kind, are the cases of monks professed, and abjuration of
the realm; all the other cases are of the second kind.
Strictly speaking, there but two cases of civil death; those
of a monk professed, and an abjuration of the realm. In
re Erskine, C.C.A.Ind., 1 F.2d 149, 152. See, generally,
Chit.Crim.Law 723; Co.Litt. §§ 133, 199, note; Littleton
§ 200; 1 Bl.Comm. 132; Avery v. Everett, 110 N.Y. 317, 18
N.E. 148, 1 L.R.A. 264; In re Donnelly's Estate, 125 Cal.
417, 58 P. 61, 73 Am.St.Rep. 62.
In New York a person sentenced to imprisonment is
thereafter deemed civilly dead under Penal Law § 511.
See Platner v. Sherwood, 6 Johns.Ch., N.Y., 118; Troup v.
Wood, 4 Johns.Ch., N.Y., 228, 260,
Death-bed. In Scotch law. A state of sickness
which ends in death. Ersk. Inst. 3, 8, 95.
Death-bed deed. In Scotch law. A deed made
by a person while laboring under a distemper of
which he afterwards died. Ersk. Inst. 3, 8, 96. A
deed is understood to be in death-bed, if, before
signing and delivery thereof, the grantor was sick,
and never convalesced thereafter. 1 Forbes, Inst.
pt. 3, b. 2, c. 4, tit. 1, § 1. But it is not necessary
that he should be actually confined to his bed at
the time of making the deed. Bell.
Death duty. A charge or toll which the state
makes upon the right to transmit or to receive
property on the death of the owner. In re Heck's
Estate, 120 Or, 80, 250 P. 735, 736. The usual name
in England for an inheritance tax.
Death warrant. A warrant from the proper
executive authority appointing the time and place
for the execution of the sentence of death upon a
convict judicially condemned to suffer that penal-
ty.
Death watch. A special guard set to watch a
prisoner condemned to death, for some days be-
fore the time for the execution, the special pur-
pose being to prevent any escape or any attempt
to anticipate the sentence.
Natural death. A death which occurs by the
unassisted operation of natural causes, as distin-
guished not only from "civil death," but also from
"violent death" (q. v.)
Presumptive death. That which is presumed
from proof of a long continued absence unheard
from and unexplained. The general rule, as now
understood, is that the presumption of the dura-
tion of life ceases at the expiration of seven years
from the time when the person was last known to
be living; and after the lapse of that period there
is a presumption of death. Smith v. Knowlton,
11 N.H. 197; Chamb. Best Ev. 304, note, collecting
the cases; 4 U.C.Q.B. 510; 1 Greenl. Ev. § 41; 5
B. & Ad. 86; Maley v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 258
Pa. 73, 101 A. 911, L.R.A.1918A, 563. In most of
the states the subject is regulated by statute.
The better opinion is that there is no presumption as to
the time of death. Davie v. Briggs, .97 U.S. 628, 24 L.Ed.
1086; Chamb.Best Ev. 305; 2 Brett, Corm 941; 2 M. & W.
894. But it has been held that death is presumed to take
place at the end of the seven years' absence; Brotherhood
of Locomotive Firemen and Engineers v. Nash, 144 Md.
623, 125 A. 441; Apitz v. Supreme Lodge Knights and
Ladies of Honor, 274 Ill. 196, 113 N.E. 63, L.R.A.1917A,
183; or at a time of peril, Conner v. New York Life Ins.
Co., 166 N.Y.S. 985, 179 App.Div. 596.
Violent death. One caused or accelerated by
the interference of human agency ;—distinguished
from "natural death."
DEATH'S PART, See Dead's Part; Dead Man's
Part.

## DEATHSMAN

The executioner; hangman; he
that executes the extreme penalty of the law.

## DEATH TRAP

A structure or situation involving
imminent risk of death or a place apparently safe
but actually very dangerous to life. Benson v.
Missouri, K. & T. R. Co., Tex.Civ.App., 200 S.W.
2d 233, 240.

## DEBASING

This word, in a statute making it
slander to charge another with being guilty of
some "debasing act which may exclude him from
society," has reference to those repulsive acts
which would cause him to be shunned or avoided,
in the same way as would a contagious disease.
Morris v. Evans, 22 Ga.App. 11, 95 S.E. 385, 386.

## DEBAUCH

To corrupt one's manners; to make
lewd; to mar or spoil; to entice; and, when used
of a woman, to seduce, or corrupt with lewdness.
Litton v. Woliver, 126 Va. 32, 100 S.E. 827, 828;
State v. Howard, 264 Mo. 386, 175 S.W. 58, 59.
Originally, the term had a limited signification,
meaning to entice or draw one away from his
work, employment, or duty; and from this sense
its application has enlarged to include the corrup-
tion of manners and violation of the person. In
RS modern legal sense, the word carries with it
the idea of "carnal knowledge," aggravated by as-
sault, violent seduction, ravishment. Koenig v.
Nott, 2 Hilt., N.Y., 323. And see State v. Curran,
51 Iowa, 112, 49 N.W. 1006. See, also, Debauchery.

## DEBAUCHERY

In general, excessive indulgence
in sensual pleasures; in a narrower sense, sexual
immorality or excesses, or the unlawful indul-
gence of lust. Suslak v. United States, C.C.A.
Mont., 213 F. 913, 917; Gillette v. United States,
C.C.A.N.D., 236 F. 215, 217.
In the White Slave Act, Act June 25, 1910, c. 395, 36 Stat.
825, 18 U.S.C.A. § 2421 et seq., making it an offense to pro-
cure the interstate transportation of a girl for the pur-
pose of prostitution and debauchery, "debauchery" is not
limited to the meaning of seduction, but includes a pur-
pose to expose her to such influence as will naturally and
inevitably so corrupt her character as to lead her to acts
of sexual immorality, or, if she is already a sexually cor-
rupt woman, a purpose that she shall engage or continue
more or less habitually in sexually immoral practices.
Van Pelt v. United States, C.C.A.Va., 240 F. 346, 348, L.R.
A.1917E, 1135.

## DEBENTURE

A certificate given by the collec-
tor of a port, under the United States customs
laws, to the effect that an importer of merchan-
(q. v.,) specifying the amount and time when pay-
able. See Act Cong. March 2, 1799, § 80, 1 St. at
Large 687.
An instrument in use in some government de-
partments, particularly in England, by which the
government is charged to pay to a creditor or his
assigns the sum found due on auditing his ac-
counts. Brande; Blount.
A security for a loan of money issued by a pub-
.
lic company, usually creating a charge on the
whole or a part of the company's stock and prop-
erty, though not necessarily in the form of a
mortgage. They are subject to certain regula-
tions as to the mode of transfer, and ordinarily
have coupons attached to facilitate the payment
of interest. They are generally issued in a series,
with provision that they shall rank part passe in
proportion to their amounts. See Bank v. Atkins,
72 Vt. 33, 47 A. 176; Cavanagh, Mon. Sec. 267;
56 L.J.R.Ch.D. 815; Brice, Ultra Vires (2d Ed.)
A charge in writing on certain property, with
the repayment at a time fixed, of money lent by
a person therein named at a given interest.
Any instrument (other than a covering or trust
deed) which either creates or agrees to create a
debt in favor of one person or corporation, or
several persons or corporations, or acknowledges
such debt. Simonson, Debentures, 5.
A debenture is distinguished (1) from a mortgage which
is an actual transfer of property, (2) from a bond which
does not directly affect property, and (3) from a mere
charge on property which is individualized and does not
form part of a series of similar charges; Cay.Mon.Sec.
267, citing L.R. 10 Ch.D. 530, 681; 15 Ch.D. 465; 21 Ch. D.
762; L.R. 7 App.Cas. 673; Jones, Corp. B. & M. 1 32; 10
H.L.C. 191; L.R. 2 Ch.D. 337.

## DEBENTURE INDENTURE

An indenture con-
taining obligations not secured by a mortgage or
other collateral; a key instrument in the process
of long term debt financing for general business
corporations. Its effect is to put the debenture-
holder in substantially the same practical position
as a bondholder secured by a first mortgage. See
"Business Lawyer" ( April 1966, pp. 678, 679, 680).

## DEBENTURE STOCK

A stock or fund repre-
senting money borrowed by a company or public
body, in England, and charged on the whole or
part of its property. An issue of stock usually
irredeemable and transferable in any amount, not
including a fraction of a pound.
The terminability and fixity in amount of debentures
being inconvenient to lenders has led to their being in
many cases superseded by debenture stock. Whart. Lex.
Debet esse finis litium. There ought to be an
end of suits; there should be some period put to
litigation. Jenk. Cent. 61.

## DEBET ET DETINET

(Lat. He owes and de-
tains.) Words anciently used in the original writ,
(and now, in English, in the plaintiff's declara7
tion,) in an action of debt, where it was brought
by one of the original contracting parties who per-
sonally gave the credit, against the other who per-
they were bound to the payment; as by the ob-
ligee against the obligor, by the landlord against
the tenant, etc. The declaration, in such cases,
states that the defendant "owes to," as well as
"detains from," the plaintiff the debt or thing in
question; and hence the action is said to be "in
the debet et detinet." Where the declaration
merely states that the defendant detains the debt,
(as in actions by and against an executor for a
debt due to or from the testator,) the action is
said to be "in the detinet" alone. Fitzh. Nat. Brev.
119, G.; 3 Bl. Comm. 155.

## DEBET ET SOLET

(Lat. He owes and is used
to.) Where a man sues in a writ of right or to
recover any right of which he is for the first time
disseised, as of a suit at a mill or in case of a
writ of quod permittat, he brings his writ in the
debet et solet. Reg. Orig. 144a; Fitzh. Nat. Brev.
122, M.
Debet quis juri subjacere ubi delinquit. One
[every one] ought to be subject to the law [of
the place] where he offends. 3 Inst. 34. This
maxim is taken from Bracton. Bract. fol. 154b.
Finch, Law, 14, 36; Wing. Max. 113; 3 Co. 231;
8 Scott N. R. 567.

## DEBET SINE BREVE

(Lat. He owes without
declaration filed.) Used in relation to a confes-
sion of judgment.
Debet sua cuique domus esse perfugium tutis-
simum. Every man's house should be a perfect-
ly safe refuge. Clason v. Shotwell, 12 Johns.,
N.Y., 31, 54.
Debile fundamentum fallit opus. A weak foun-
dation frustrates [or renders vain] the work [built
upon it.] Shep. Touch. 60; Noy, Max. 5, max.
12; Finch, Law, b. 1, ch. 3. When the foundation
fails, all goes to the ground; as, where the cause
of action fails, the action itself must of necessity
fail. Wing. Max. 113, 114, max. 40; Broom, Max.

## DEBIT

A sum charged as due or owing. The
term is used in book-keeping to denote the left
page of the ledger, or the charging of a person or
an account with all that is supplied to or paid out
for him or for the subject of the account. Also,
the balance of an account where it is shown that
something remains due to the party keeping the
account.
In industrial insurance nomenclature, a certain
identified territory in which a solicitor operates
by soliciting new business and taking care, as
through collection of the debit accounts, of the
company's patrons for insurance theretofore writ-
ten; such insurance being usually written in small
amounts on the weekly payment plan. Jones v.
Prudential Ins. Co. of America, 173 Mo.App. 1, 155
S.W. 1106, 1107.

## DEBITA FUNDI

L. Lat. In Scotch law. Debts
DEBITA LAICORUM. L. Lat. In old English
law. Debts of the laity, or of lay persons. Debts
recoverable in the civil courts. Crabb. Eng. Law,
Debita sequuntur personam debitoris. Debts
follow the person of the debtor; that is, they have
no locality, and may be collected wherever the
debtor can be found. 2 Kent, Comm. 429; Story,
Confl. Laws, § 362; Halkers, Max. 13.

## DEBITOR

In the civil and old English law. A
debtor.
Debitor non pra sumitur donare. A debtor is
not presumed to make a gift. Whatever disposi-
tion he makes of his property is supposed to be in
satisfaction of his debts. 1 Kames, Eq. 212.
Where a debtor gives money or goods, or grants
land to his creditor, the natural presumption is
that he means to get free from his obligation, and
not to make a present, unless donation be ex-
pressed. Ersk. Inst. 3, 3, 93; Dig. 50, 16, 108; 1
P. Wms. 239; Wh. & Tud. L. Cas. Eq. 378.
Debitorum pactionibus creditorum petitio nec
tolli nec minui potest. 1 Poth. Obl. 108; Broom,
Max. 697, Bart. Max. 115. The rights of creditors
can neither be taken away nor diminished by
agreements among (or of) the debtors.

## DEBITRIX

A female debtor.

## DEBITUM

Something due, or owing, a debt.
Debitum et contractus sunt nullius loci. Debt
and contract are of [belong to] no place; have
no particular locality. 7 Co. 61. The obligation
in these cases is purely personal, and actions to
enforce it may be brought anywhere. 2 Inst. 231;
Story, Confl. Laws, § 362; 1 Smith, Lead. Cas. 340,
363; 7 M. & G. 1019, n.

## DEBITUM IN PRIESENTI SOLVENDUM IN FU- TURO

A debt or obligation complete when con-
tracted, but of which the performance cannot be
required till some future period.

## DEBITUM SINE BREVI

L. Lat. Debt without
writ; debt without a declaration. In old practice,
this term denoted an action begun by original bill,
instead of by writ. In modern usage, it is some-
times applies to a debt evidenced by confession of
judgment without suit. The equivalent Norman-
French phrase was "debit sans breve." Both are
abbreviated to d. s. b.

## DEBT

A sum of money due by certain and ex-
press agreement; as by bond for a determinate
sum, a bill or note, a special bargain, or a rent
reserved on a lease, where the amount is fixed
and specific, and does not depend upon any subse-
quent valuation to settle it. 3 Bl.Comm. 154;
Hagar v. Reclamation Dist., 111 U.S. 701, 4 S.Ct.
663, 28 L.Ed. 569; Neilson v. Title Guaranty &
Surety Co., 101 Or. 262, 199 P. 948, 951; Shultz v.
Ritterbusch, 38 Okl. 478, 134 P. 961, 968; W. S.
Tyler Co. v. Deutsche Dampfschifffahrts Gesell-
schaft Hansa, Bremen, Germany, D.C.Ohio, 276 F.
Ail unconditional promise to pay a fixed sum at a speci-
fied time. Lowery v. Fuller, 221 Mo.App. 495, 281 S.W. 968,
972. A contractual obligation to pay in the future for consid-
erations received in the present. Lesser v. Warren Borough,
237 Pa. 501, 85 A. 839, 841, 43 L.R.A.,N.S., 839. The word
"debt" carries with it the requirement of certainty, the
foundation of promise by express contract, and necessarily
implies legality. Clinton Mining & Mineral Co. v. Beacon,
C.C.A.Pa., 266 F. 621, 622, 14 A.L.R. 263.
The word "debt," in the definition of a mortgage as a
hypothecation or pledge of property as security for a debt,
means a duty or obligation to pay, for the enforcement of
which an action lies. Stollenwerck v. Marks & Gayle, 188
Ala. 587, 65 So. 1024, 1027, Ann.Cas.1917C, 981; Gibson v.
Hopkins, 80 W.Va. 756, 93 S.E. 826, 827.
Standing alone, the word "debt" is as applicable to a
sum of money which has been promised at a future day, as
to a sum of money now due and payable. To distinguish
between the two, it may be said of the former that it is
a debt owing, and of the latter that it is a debt due. A
sum of money which is certainly and in all events payable
is a debt, without regard to the fact whether it be payable
now or at a future time. A sum payable upon a contingen-
cy, however, is not a debt, or does not become a debt un-
til the contingency has happened. People v. Arguello, 37
Cal. 524..
A sum of money arising upon a contract, ex-
press or implied. Kimpton v. Bronson, 45 Barb.
N.Y., 618; Johnson v. Garner, D.C.Nev., 233 F.
756, 767. Also, the obligation to pay a sum cer-
tain; Indian Refining Co. v. Taylor, 195 Ind. 223,
143 N.E. 682, 689; or a sum which may be ascer-
tained by simple mathematical calculation from
known facts; H. G. Kilbourne Co. v. Standard
Stamp Affixer Co., 216 Mass. 118, 103 N.E. 469,
470; regardless of whether the liability arises by
contract or is implied or imposed by law; State
v. Latham, 136 Tenn. 30, 188 S.W. 534, 535; Lind-
strom v. Spicher, 53 N.D. 195, 205 N.W. 231, 233,
41 A.L.R. 968.
A "debt" is a specified sum of money owing to one per-
son from another, including not only the obligation of the
debtor to pay, but the right of the creditor to receive and
enforce payment. Angola Brick & Tile Co. v. Millgrov
School Tp., Steuben County, 73 Ind.App. 557, 127 N.E. 855,
856; Dewey v. Denson, 31 Ga.App. 352, 120 S.E. 805, 807.
A fixed and certain obligation to pay money or
some other valuable thing or things, either in the
present or in the future. Burke v. Boulder Mill-
ing & Elevator Co., 77 Colo. 230, 235 P. 574, 575.
In a still more general sense, that which is due
from one person to another, whether money,
goods, or services. Holman v. Hollis, 94 Fla. 614,
114 So. 254, 255; State v. State Board of Exam-
iners, 74 Mont. 1, 238 P. 316, 323.
A "debt" is an obligation arising otherwise than by sen-
tence by a court for a breach of the public peace or for
crime. Ruggles v. State, 120 Md. 553, 87 A. 1080, 1084.
In a broad sense, any duty to respond to an-
other in money, labor, or service; it may even
mean a moral or honorary obligation, unenforce-
able by legal action. U. S. Sugar Equalization
Board v. P. De Ronde & Co., C.C.A.Del., 7 F.2d
981, 984.
Also, sometimes, an aggregate of separate debts,
or the total sum of the existing claims against a
person or company. Thus we speak of the "na-
tional debt," the "bonded debt" of a corporation,
etc.
The word "debt" has no fixed legal meaning; Electric
Reduction Co. v. Lewellyn, C.C.A.Pa., 11 F.2d 493, 494;
. and color from accompanying words; Morrow v, Hayes,
226 Mich. 301, 197 N.W. 554, 555.
The word is of large import, including not only debts by
specialty, and debts of record, or judgments (Liberty Mut.
Ins. Co. v. Johnson Shipyards Corporation, C.C.A.N.Y., 6
F.2d 752, 755; Schooley v. Schooley, 184 Iowa 835, 169 N.
W. 56, 57, 11 A.L.R. 110; Bronson v. Syverson, 88 Wash.
264, 152 P. 1039, 1040, L.R.A.1916B, 993; Rosenberg v. Ros-
enberg, 152 Md. 49, 135 A. 840), but also obligations aris-
ing under simple contract, to a very wide extent; and in
its popular sense includes all that is due to a man under
any form of obligation or promise. McCrea v. First Nat.
Bank, 162 Minn. 455, 203 N.W.290; /Etna Ins. Co. v. Rob-
ertson, 126 Miss. 387, 88 So. 883, 890.
Synonyms
The term "demand" is of much broader import than
"debt," and embraces rights of action belonging to the
debtor beyond those which could appropriately be called
"debts." In this respect the term "demand" is one of
very extensive import. In re Denny, 2 Hill, N.Y., 223.
Nevertheless, "debt" may be synonymous with "claim";
In re Littleton's Estate, 223 N.Y.S. 470, 479, 129 Misc. 845;
and may include any kind of a just demand. Goldberg v.
Parker, 87 Conn. 99, 87 A. 555, 557, 46 L.R.A.,N.S., 1097,
Ann.Cas.1914C, 1059.
The word dues is equivalent to "debts," or that which is
owing and has a contractual significance. State v. Mort-
gage Security Co., 154 Minn, 453, 192 N.W. 348, 350.
"Debt" is not exactly synonymous with "duty." A debt
is a legal liability 'to pay a specific sum of money; a duty
is a legal obligation to perform some act. Allen v. Dick-
son, Minor, Ala., 120.
"Obligation" is a broader term than "debt." Bovee v.
Boyle, 25 Colo.App. 165, 136 P. 467, 469. Every obligation
is not a debt, though every debt is an obligation. Lind-
strom v. Spicher, 53 N.D. 195, 205 N.W. 231, 233, 41 A.L.R.
968; In re Moorehead's Estate, 289 Pa. 542, 137 A. 802, 806,
52 A.L.R. 1251.
The words "debt" and "liability" are not necessarily
synonymous. As applied to the pecuniary relations of
parties, liability is a term of broader significance than
debt. Coulter Dry Goods Co. v. Wentworth, 171 Cal. 500,
153 P. 939, 940. Liability is responsibility; the state of
one who is bound in law and justice to do something which
may be enforced by action. This liability may arise from
contracts either express or implied, or in consequence of
torts committed. McElfresh v. Kirkendall, 36 Iowa 226.
"Liability" ordinarily means an obligation which may or
may not ripen into a debt. Irving Bank-Columbia Trust
Co. v. New York Rys. Co., D.C.N.Y., 292 F. 429, 433. Yet
"debt" may sometimes include various kinds of liabilities.
See Allen v. Cosmopolitan Trust Co., 247 Mass. 334, 142 N.
E. 100, 103; Carroll v. Bowling, 151 Md. 59, 133 A. 851, 854.
In General

16 Pet. 25, 10 L.Ed. 873; A. & E. Encyc.
Debt by simple contract. A debt or demand
founded upon a verbal or implied contract, or
upon any written agreement that is not under seal.
Debt by specialty or special contract. A debt
due, or acknowledged to be due, by some deed or
instrument under seal; as a deed of covenant or
sale, a lease reserving rent, or a bond or obliga-
tion. 2 Bl.Comm. 465; In re Harris, 101 N.J.Eq.
5, 137 A. 215, 216; Kerr v. Lydecker, 51 Ohio St.
240. 37 N.E. 267, 23 L.R.A. 842; Marriott v. Thomp-
Debt ex mutuo. A species of debt or obligation
mentioned by Glanville and Bracton, and which

Debt of record. A debt which appears to be due
by the evidence of a court of record, as by a judg-
ment or recognizance. 2 B1.Comm. 465.
Doubtful debt. One of which the payment is un-
certain. Clef des Lois Romaines.
In Practice
The name of a common-law action, which lies
to recover a certain specific sum of money, or a
sum that can readily be reduced to a certainty. 3
B1.Comm. 154; 3 Steph.Comm. 461; 1 Tidd, Pr. 3;
Drennen Motor Car Co. v. Evans, 192 Ala. 150, 68
So. 303; Bullard v. Bell, 1 Mass. 243, Fed.Cas.No.
2,121; U. S. v. Claflin, 97 U.S. 546, 24 L.Ed. 1082;
Baum v. Tonkin, 110 Pa. 569, 1 A. 535.
It is thus distinguished from assumpsit, which lies as
well where the sum due is uncertain as where it is certain,
and from covenant, which lies only upon contracts evi-
denced in a certain manner.
It is said to lie in the debit and detinet, (when
it is stated that the defendant owes and detains,)
or in the detinet, (when it is stated merely that
he detains.) Debt in the detinet for goods differs
from detinue, because it is not essential in this
action, as in detinue, that the specific property in
the goods should have been vested in the plaintiff
at the time the action is brought. Dyer, 24b.
Existing debt. See Existing Debt.
Fraudulent debt. A debt created by fraud.
Such a debt implies confidence and deception. It
implies that it arose out of a contract, express
or implied, and that fraudulent practices were em-
ployed by the debtor, by which the creditor was
defrauded. Howland v. Carson, 28 Ohio St. 628.
Hypothecary debt. One which is a lien upon an
estate.
Judgment debt. See Judgment Debt.
Legal debts. Those that are recoverable in a
court of common law, as debt on a bill of ex-

Mass. 225, 65 N.E. 68.
Liquid debt. One which is immediately and un-
conditionally due.

the same capacity and right, and of the same kind
and quality. Lippitt v. Thames Loan & Trust Co.,
88 Conn. 185, 90 A. 369, 374.
Passive debt. A debt upon which, by agreement
between the debtor and creditor, no interest is
payable, as distinguished from active debt; i. e., a
the terms "active" and "passive" are applied to
certain debts due from the Spanish government
to Great Britain. Wharton. In another sense of
the wards, a debt is "active" or "passive" accord-
ing as the person of the creditor or debtor is re-
garded; a passive debt being that which a man
owes; an active debt that which is owing to him.
In this meaning every debt is both active and
passive,—active as regards the creditor, passive as
regards the debtor.
Privileged debt. One which is to be paid before
others in case a debtor is insolvent.
Public debt. That which is due or owing by the
government of a state or nation. The terms "pub-
lic debt" and "public securities," used in legisla-
tion, are terms generally applied to national or
state obligations and dues, and would rarely, if
ever, be construed to include town debts or obli-
gations; nor would the term "public revenue"
ordinarily be applied to funds arising from town
taxes. Morgan v. Cree, 46 Vt. 773, 14 Am.Rep.
Pure debt. In Scotch law. A debt due now and
unconditionally is so called. It is thus distin-
guished from a future debt,—payable at a fixed
day in the future,—and a contingent debt, which
will only become due upon the happening of a cer-
tain contingency.
Simple contract debt. One where the contract
upon which the obligation arises is neither ascer-
tained by matter of record nor yet by deed or spe-
cial instrument, but by mere oral evidence the
most simple of any, or by notes unsealed, which
are capable of a more easy proof, and therefore
only better than a verbal promise. 2 Bl.Comm.
Solvent debts. In Pennsylvania, the "solvent
debts" which a city may deduct from its gross in-
debtedness pursuant to Act April 20, 1874, P.L. 65,
in ascertaining its borrowing capacity, are debts
due it directly, payment of which it can enforce as
one of its quick assets for the liquidation of any of
its obligations. McGuire v. City of Philadelphia,
245 Pa. 287, 91 A. 622, 623.
Specialty debt. See Debt by Specialty or Special
Contract, supra.

prisonment for debt in England, and for the pun-
ishment of fraudulent debtors. 2 Steph.Comm.

true; (2) the assertion, as a fact, of that which is not
true, by one who has no reasonable ground for believing it
to be true; (3) the suppression of a fact, by one who is
bound to disclose it, or who gives information of other
facts which are likely to mislead for want of communica-

To constitute "deceit," the statement must be untrue,
made with knowledge of its falsity or with reckless and
conscious ignorance thereof, especially if parties are not
on equal terms, made with intent that plaintiff act there-
on or in a manner apparently fitted to induce him to act
thereon, - and plaintiff must act in reliance on the state-

Volderauer v. State, 195 Ind. 415, 143 N.E. 674, 676;
Chambers v. Farnham, 39 Cal.App. 17, 179 P. 423, 424.
A determination of a judicial or quasi judicial
nature. Codington County v. Board of Com'rs of
Codington County, 51 S.D. 131, 212 N.W. 626, 628.
Statement by trial justice after trial before court with-
out jury does not constitute "decision." Shaul v. Fidelity
& Deposit Co. of Maryland, 131 Misc. 401, 227 N.Y.S. 163,
1.68. A "decision" involves reaching a conclusion. Lam-
bros v. Young, 145 F.2d 341, 343, 79 U.S.App.D.C. 247.
The term is broad enough to cover both final judgments
and interlocutory orders. Stout v. Stout, 68 Ind.App. 278,
131 N.E. 245, 246. And though sometimes limited to the
sense of judgment; Industrial Commission of Ohio v. Mus-
selli, 102 Ohio St. 10, 130 N.E. 32, 33; the term is at other
times understood as meaning simply the first step leading
to a judgment; Dorney v. Ives, 36 R.I. 276, 90 A. 164, 165;
or as an order for judgment; Collins v. Belland, 37 Cal.
App. 139, 173 P. 601, 602. The word may also include var-
ious rulings, as well as orders. U. S. v. Thompson, 251 U.
S. 407, 40 S.Ct. 289, 291, 64 L.Ed. 333; Marr v. Marr, 194
Cal. 332, 228 P. 534, 535.
The words "decision" and judgment" may be used in-
terchangeably, but in the abstract there is a shade of dif-
ference between the two. Smith v. State, 196 Ga. 595, 27
S.E.2d 369, 373.
"Decision" is not necessarily synonymous with "opin-
ion." A decision of the court is its judgment; the opin-
ion is the reasons given for that judgment, or the expres-
sion of the views of the judge. Craig v. Bennett, 158 Ind.
9, 62 N.E. 273; But the two words are sometimes used
interchangeably. Pierce v. State, 109 Ind. 535, 10 N.E. 302;
Keller v. Summers, 262 Mo. 324, 171 S.W. 336, 337.
The French lawyers call the opinions which they give
on questions propounded to them, decisions. See Inst. 1,
2, 8; Dig. 1, 2, 2.
DECISIVE, or DECISORY, OATH. See Oath.

## DECISION ON MERITS

A decision determining
the validity of a written instrument or passing on
a controversy with respect to the interpretation
thereof which bars subsequent suit on same cause
of action. Eulenberg v. Torley's Inc., 56 Cal.App.
2d 653, 133 P.2d 15, 17.

## DECLARANT

A person who makes a declara-
tion.
DECLARATION.
In Pleading
The first of the pleadings on the part of the
plaintiff in an action at law, being a formal and
stances constituting his cause of action. It com-
monly comprises several sections or divisions,
called "counts," and its formal parts follow each
other in this order: Title, venue, commencement,
cause of action, counts, conclusion. The declara-
tion, at common law, answers to the "libel" in ec-
clesiastical and admiralty law, the "bill" in equity,
the "petition" in civil law, the "complaint" in
code pleading, and the "count" in real actions. U.
S. v. Ambrose, 108 U.S. 336, 2 S.Ct. 682, 27 L.Ed.
746; Railway Co. v. Nugent, 86 Md. 349, 38 A.
779, 39 L.R.A. 161; Dixon v. Sturgeon, 6 Serg.
& R. (Pa.) 28; 1 Chit.Pl. 248; Co.Litt. 17 a, 303 a;
Bacon, Abr. Pleas (B) ; Comyns, Dig. Pleader,
C, 7; Lawes, Pl. 35; Steph.Pl. 36; Leslie v. Men-
delson, 302 Mich. 95, 4 N.W.2d 481, 484.
It may be general or special: for example, in debt on a
bond, a declaration counting on the penal part only is gen-
eral; one which sets out both the bond and the condition
and assigns the breach is special; Gould, Pl. c. 4, § 50.
In Evidence
An unsworn statement or narration of facts
made by a party to the transaction, or by one who
has an interest in the existence of the facts re-
counted. Also, similar statements made by a per-
son since deceased, which are admissible in evi-
dence in some cases, contrary to the general rule,
e. g., "dying declarations" (see that subtitle, in-
fra).
In Practice
The declaration or declaratory part of a judg-
ment, decree, or order is that part which gives the
decision or opinion of the court on the question
of law in the case. Thus, in an action raising a
question as to the construction of a will, the judg-
ment or order declares that, according to the true
construction of the will, the plaintiff has become
entitled to the residue of the testator's estate, or
the like. Sweet.
In Scotch Practice
The statement of a criminal or prisoner, taken
before a magistrate. 2 Alis. Crim. Pr. 555; 2
Hume 328; Arkl. Just. 70; Paterson, Comp. §1
952, 970.
In General
A "declaration" is a statement made out of
court. Dawson v. Davis, 125 Conn. 330, 5 A.2d
703, 704.
Declaration against interest. Such declarations
are evidence of the fact declared, and are there-
fore distinct from admissions, which amount to a
waiver of proof. Jelser v. White, 183 N.C. 126,
110 S.E. 849, 850. They are statements which,
when made, conflict with the pecuniary interest
of the person making them, who need not have
been a party, privy or witness to the suit in which
they are offered. Elliotte v. Lavier, 299 Mich.
373, 300 N.W. 116, 118.
Declaration in chief. A declaration for the prin-
cipal cause of action. 1 Tidd, Pr. 419.
tion in setting aside a portion of the net or sur-
plus proceeds for distribution among the stock-
holders according to their respective interests.
First Nat. Bank & Trust Co. v. Glenn, D.C.Ky.,
36 F.Supp. 552, 554. See, also, Dividend.
Declaration of homestead. A creature of, and its
validity depends upon, compliance with home-
stead statute. It is merely an act of the owner
whereby he avails himself of, and secures, a right
or privilege given him by statute; it is neither
a conveyance nor a contract, and there is no trans-
fer of, or change in, title, nor any agreement of
transfer or change. U. S. Fidelity & Guaranty Co.
v, Adloway, 173 Wash. 404, 23 P.2d 408. See, also,
Homestead.
Declaration of independence. A formal decla-
ration or announcement, promulgated July 4, 1776,
by the congress of the United States of America,
in the name and behalf of the people of the col-
onies, asserting and proclaiming their independ-
ence of the British crown, vindicating their preten-
sions to political autonomy, and anouncing them-
selves to the world as a free and independent na-
tion.
Declaration of intention. A declaration made
by an alien, as a preliminary to naturalization, be-
fore a court of record, to the effect that it is his
intention in good faith to become a citizen of the
United States, and to renounce forever all allegi-
ance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate,
state, or sovereignty whereof at the time he may
be a citizen or subject. 8 U.S.C.A. § 731.
Declaration of right. See Bill of Rights.
Declaration of trust. The act by which the per-
son who holds the legal title to property or an es-
tate acknowledges and declares that he holds the
same in trust to the use of another person or for
certain specified purposes. The name is also used
to designate the deed or other writing embodying
such a declaration. Griffith v. Maxfield, 66 Ark.
513, 51 S.W. 832. See Baker v. Baker, 123 Md.
32, 90 A. 776, 779 (bank deposit) ; Del Giorgio v.
Powers, 27 Ca1.App.2d 668, 81 P.2d 1006, 1012
(mining claim) ; Bingen v. First Trust Co. of
St. Paul, C.C.A.Minn., 103 F.2d 260, 264 (letter).
Declaration of war. A public and formal proc-
lamation by a nation, through its executive or leg-
islative department, that a state of war exists be-
tween itself and another nation, and forbidding
all persons to aid or assist the enemy.
An act of Congress is necessary to the commencement of
a foreign war and is in itself a "declaration" and fixes
the date of the war. West v. Palmetto State Life Ins. Co.,
202 S.C. 422, 25 S.E.2d 475, 477, 145 A.L.R. 1461; Rosenau
v. Idaho Mut. Ben. Ass'n, 65 Idaho 408, 145 P.2d 227, 230.
Dying declarations. Statements made by a per-
son who is lying at the point of death, and is con-
scious of his approaching dissolution, in reference
to the manner in which he received the injuries
of which he is dying, or other immediate cause of
his death, and in reference to the person who in-
flicted such injuries or the connection with such
of having committed them; which statements are
admissible in evidence in a trial for homicide (and
occasionally, at least in some jurisdictions, in oth-
er cases) where the killing of the declarant is
the crime charged to the defendant. Shepard v.
U. S., Kan., 290 U.S. 96, 54 S.Ct. 22, 78 L.Ed. 196;
See generally Simons v. People, 150 Ill. 66, 36 N.E.
1019; Frier v. State, 92 Fla. 241, 109 So. 334, 335;
Lucas v. Commonwealth, 153 Ky. 424, 155 S.W.
721, 722; Edwards v. State, 113 Neb. 698, 204 N.W.
780, 783; People v. Selknes, 309 Ill. 113, 140 N.E.
852, 854. Also Barsch v. Hammond, 110 Colo. 441,

wealth, 178 Va. 294, 16 S.E.2d 808, 813 (shooting) ;
State v. Brown, 209 Minn. 478, 296 N.W. 582, 586
(abortion).
Statements made by deceased while on operating table
were inadmissible as "dying declarations" where there was
no statement by deceased himself that he knew that death
was approaching. People v. Hall, 260 App.Div. 421, 22 N.Y.
S.2d 973, 976.
Self-serving declaration. One made by a party
in his own interest at some time and place out of
court;-not including testimony which he gives
as witness at the trial. Brosnan v. Boggs, 101
Or. 472, 198 P. 890, 892.

## DECLARATION OF LONDON

A declaration
concerning the laws of naval war, agreed upon
February 26, 1909, by the powers assembled at
the London Naval Conference.
The preamble states that the Declaration was made in
view of the desirability of an agreement upon the rules to
be applied by the International Prize Court established by
the Second Hague Conference. A preliminary provision
states that it is agreed that the rules adopted "correspond
in substance with the generally recognized principles of
international law." The subjects dealt with by the Dec-
laration include Blockade, Contraband, Unneutral Service,
Destruction of Neutral Prizes, Transfer to Neutral Flag,
Enemy Character, Convoy, Search, and Compensation.
Higgins, 538-613.

## DECLARATION OF PARIS

The name given to
an agreement announcing four important rules
of international law effected between the principal
European powers at the Congress of Paris in
1856. These rules are: (1) Privateering is and
remains abolished; (2) the neutral flag covers
enemy's goods, except contraband of war; (3)
neutral goods, except contraband of war, are not
liable to confiscation under a hostile flag; (4)
blockades, to be binding, must be effective.

## DECLARATION OF ST

PETERSBURG. A dec.
laration made at St. Petersburg in 1868 on behalf
of certain of the powers in relation to the prohibi-
tion of the use of explosive bullets in time of war,
DECLARATOR. In Scotch law. An action
whereby it is sought to have some right of prop-
erty, or of status, or other right judicially ascer-
tained and declared. Bell.

## DECLARATOR OF TRUST

An action resorted
to against a trustee who holds property upon ti-
tles ex facie for his own benefit. Bell
or elucidate what before was uncertain or doubt-
ful.

## DECLARATORY ACTION

In Scotch law. An
action in which the right of the pursuer (or plain-
tiff) is craved to be declared, but nothing claimed
to be done by the defender (defendant.) Ersk.
Inst. 5, 1, 46. Otherwise called an "action of de-
clarator."

## DECLARATORY DECREE

In practice. A bind-
ing declaration of right in equity without conse-
quential relief.

## DECLARATORY JUDGMENT

One which sim-
ply declares the rights of the parties or expresses
the opinion of the court on a question of law, with-
out ordering anything to be done. Its distinctive
characteristics are that no executory process fol-
lows as of course, nor is it necessary that an ac-
tual wrong, giving rise to action for damages,
should have been done, or be immediately threat-
ened. Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co. v. Huff-
man, La., 319 U.S. 293, 63 S.Ct. 1070, 87 L.Ed. 1407;
Petition of Kariher, 284 Pa. 455, 131 A. 265, 268;
Village of Bay v. Gelvick, 58 Ohio App. 51, 15 N.E.
2d 786, 791. It must deal with real dispute of real
fact. Rauh v. Fletcher Savings & Trust Co., 207
Ind. 638, 194 N.E. 334, 335. It is distinguished
from other actions in that it does not seek execu-
tion or performance from the defendant or op-
posing party. Brindley v. Meara, Ind., 209 Ind.
144, 198 N.E. 301, 101 A.L.R. 682; Gutensohn v.
Kansas City Southern Ry. Co., C.C.A.Mo., 140 F.
2d 950.

## DECLARATORY PART OF A LAW

That which
clearly defines rights to be observed and wrongs
to be eschewed.

## DECLARATORY STATUTE

One enacted for
the purpose of removing doubts or putting an end
to conflicting decisions in regard to what the law
is in relation to a particular matter. It may either
be expressive of the common Iaw, 1 Bl. Comm. 86;
Gray v. Bennett, 3 Mete., Mass., 527; In re Un-
garo's Will, 88 N.J.Eq, 25, 102 A. 244, 246, or may
declare what shall be taken to be the true mean-
ing and intention of a previous statute, though
in the latter case such enactments are more com-
monly called "expository statutes." McMahon v.
Maddox, Tex.Civ.App., 297 S.W. 310, 312.
A statute enacted to put an end to a doubt as
to what is the common law, or the meaning of an-
other statute, and which declares what it is and
ever has been. Nelson v. Sandkamp, 227 Minn.
177, 34 N.W.2d 640, 642, 5 A.L.R.2d 1136.

## DECLARE

To make known, manifest, or clear.
Lasier v. Wright, 304 Ill. 130, 136 N.E. 545, 552,
28 A.L.R. 674. To signify, to show in any man-
ner either by words or acts. Edwardson v. Ger-
wien, 41 N.D. 506, 171 N.W. 101, 102. To publish;
to utter; to announce clearly some opinion or res-
olution. Knecht v. Ins. Co., 90 Pa. 121, 35 Am.
Rep. 641. As to "declare" a dividend. A. T. Jer-
gins Trust v. Rogan, D.C.Cal., 40 F.Supp. 40, 42.
222 S.W. 750, 754. To solemnly assert a fact be-
fore witnesses, e. g., where a testator declares a
paper signed by him to be his last will and testa-
ment. Lane v. Lane, 95 N.Y. 498.
This also is one of the words customarily used in the
promise given by a person who is affirmed as a witness,-
"sincerely and truly declare and affirm." Hence, to make
a positive and solemn asseveration. Bassett v. Denn, 17 N.
J. Law, 433.
With reference to pleadings, it means to draw
up, serve, and file a declaration; e. g., a "rule to
declare." Also to allege in a declaration as a
ground or cause of action; as "he declares upon
a promissory note."
DECLINATION. In Scotch law. A plea to the
jurisdiction, on the ground that the judge is in-
terested in the suit.

## DECLINATOIRES

In French law. Pleas to the
jurisdiction of the court; also of lis pendens, and
of connexite, (q. v.).
DECLINATORY EXCEPTIONS are such dilatory
exceptions as merely decline the jurisdiction of
the judge before whom the action is brought..
Code Proc. La. 334. A plea to the jurisdiction ra-
tionae personae. Diamond T. Motor Trucks V.
Heck, La.App., 13 So.2d 512, 514.

## DECLINATORY PLEA

In English practice.
The plea of sanctuary, or of benefit of clergy, be-
fore trial or conviction. 2 Hale, P.C. 236; 4 Bl,
Comm. 333. Now abolished. 6 & 7 Geo. IV, c. 28,
§ 6; Mozl. & W. Diet.; 4 Steph. Comm. 400, note;
Id. 436, note.

## DECLINATURE

In Scotch practice, An objec,
tion to the jurisdiction of a judge. Bell.

## DECLINE

A failing process, a tendency to a
worse state; to become gradually impaired; a,
falling off or downward tendency. Exum v. Laub,
C.C.A.Tex., 87 F.2d 73, 74; Buffalo County v.
Phelps County, 129 Neb. 268, 261 N.W. 360.

## DECOCTION

The act of boiling a substance in
water, for extracting its virtues. The operation
of boiling certain ingredients in a fluid for the
purpose of extracting the parts soluble at that
temperature. Also the liquor in which a substance
has been boiled; water impregnated with the
principles of any animal or vegetable substance
boiled in it. Webster; Sykes v. Magone, C.C.N.Y.,
38 F. 497.
In an indictment "decoction" and "Infusion" are ejusdem.
generic; and if one is alleged to have been administered,
instead of the other, the variance is immaterial. 3 Camp.

## DECOCTOR

In the Roman law. A bankrupt;
a spendthrift; a squanderer of public funds. Cal-
vin.

## DECOLLATIO

Decollation; the punishment of beheading. Fleta,
lib. 1, c. 21, § 6.
United States v. 1851 Cartons, More or Less, etc.,
D.C.Colo., 55 F.Supp. 343, 346; A. 0. Anderson &
Co. v. U. S., C.C.A.Wash., 284 F. 542, 544. A sep-
aration into components; specifically, decay or
dissolution. In re Vetter, Cust. & Pat.App., 96
F.2d 999, 1000.

## DECONFES

In French law. A name formerly
given to those persons who died without confes-
sion, whether they refused to confess or whether
they were criminals to whom the sacrament was
refused. Droit de -Canon, per M. l'Abbe Andre;
Dupin, Gloss. to Loisel's Institutes.

## DECORATE

To beautify. To do something, as
to a house as such, to improve the condition of
the house, or of a room. Grasell v. Brodhead,
175 App.Div. 874, 162 N.Y.S. 421, 423. The addi-
tion of something becoming or beautiful. Upsal
Street Realty Co. v. Rubin, 326 Pa. 327, 192 A.
481, 483.

## DECORATOR

One whose business is the decora-
tion of dwellings or public edifices. Grasell v.
Brodhead, 175 App.Div. 874, 162 N.Y.S. 421, 423.

## DECOY

To inveigle, entice, tempt, or lure; as,
to decoy a person within the jurisdiction of a court
so that he may be served with process, or to decoy
a fugitive criminal to a place where he may be ar-
rested without extradition papers, or to decoy one
away from his place of residence for the purpose
of kidnapping him and as a part of that act. In
all these uses, the word implies enticement or lur-
ing by means of some fraud, trick, or temptation,
but excludes the idea of force. Eberling v. State,
136 Ind. 117, 35 N.E. 1023; John v. State, 44 P.
51, 6 Wyo. 203.
Also, a "decoy pond." See that title, infra.

## DECOY LETTER

A letter prepared and mailed
for the purpose of detecting a criminal, particu-
larly one who is perpetrating frauds upon the pos-
tal or revenue laws. U. S. v. Whittier, 5 Dill. 39,
Fed, Cas. No. 16,688.

## DECOY POND

A pond used for the breeding
and maintenance of water-fowl. Keeble v. Hick-
eringshall, 3 Salk. 10; 11 Mod. 74, 130; Holt 14;
11 East 571.
DECREE,
In Practice
The judgment of a court of equity or ad-
miralty, answering for most purposes to the
judgment of a court of common law. A de-
cree in equity is a sentence or order of the
court, pronounced on hearing and understanding
all the points in issue, and determining the rights
of all the parties to the suit, according to equity
and good conscience. 2 Daniell, Ch.Pr. 986; Woos-
ter v. Handy, C.C.N.Y., 23 F. 49, 56; Motion Pic-
ture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co., D.C.,
N.Y., 232 F. 263, 265; Bull v. International Power
Co., 84 N.J.Eq. 209, 93 A. 86, 88; Alford v. Leon-
ard, 88 Fla. 532, 102 So. 885, 890. It is a declara-
tion of the court announcing the legal consequenc-
Tex.Civ.App., 174 S.W. 627, 629.
A decree, as distinguished from an order, is final, and is
made at the hearing of the cause, whereas an order is in-
terlocutory, and is made on motion or petition. Wherever
an order may, in a certain event resulting from the direc-
tion contained in the order, lead to the termination of the
suit in like manner as a decree made at the hearing, it is
called a "decretal order." Brown.
A judgment at law, as distinguished from a decree in
equity, was either simply for the plaintiff or for the de-
fendant. There could be no qualifications or modifications.
But such a judgment does not always touch the true justice
of the cause or put the parties in the position they ought
to occupy. This result was attained by the decree of a
court of equity which could be so moulded, or the execu-
tion of which could be so controlled and suspended, that
the relative duties and rights of the parties could be se-
cured and enforced. Bisph.Eq. § 7.
The words "judgment" and "decree," however, are often
used synonymously; Finnell v. Finnell, 113 Okl. 269, 230
P. 912, 913; especially now that the Codes have abolished
the distinction between law and equity; Henderson v.
Arkansas, 71 Okl. 253, 176 P. 751, 753. But of the two
terms, "judgment" is the more • comprehensive, and in-
cludes "decree." Coleman v. Los Angeles County, 180 Cal.
714, 182 P. 440, 441.
Decision of an administrative board though based on
facts adduced on a hearing, Dal Maso v. Board of Com'rs
of Prince George's County, 182 Md. 200, 34 A.2d 464, 466, or
rescript from reviewing court are not decrees. City of
Boston v. Santosuosso, 308 Mass. 189, 31 N.E.2d 564, 568.
Classification
Decrees in equity are either final or interlocu-
tory. A final decree is one which fully and finally
disposes of the whole litigation, determining all
questions raised by the case, and leaving nothing
that requires further judicial action. Sawyer v.
White, 125 Me. 206, 132 A. 421, 422; Draper Corpo-
ration v. Stafford Co., C.C.A.Mass., 255 F. 554, 555;
Burgin v. Sugg, 210 Ala. 142, 97 So. 216, 2177 An
interlocutory decree is a provisional or prelimin-
ary decree, which is not final and does not deter-
mine the suit, but directs some further proceed-
ings preparatory to the final decree. It is a decree
pronounced for the purpose of ascertaining mat-
ter of law or fact preparatory to a final decree. 1
Barb. Ch. Pr. 326, 327; Wooster v. Handy, C.C.
N.Y., 23 F. 49, 56; Beebe v. Russell, 19 How. 283,
15 L.Ed. 668; Cornely v. Marckwald, 131 U.S. 159,
9 S.Ct. 744, 33 L.Ed. 117. Where something more
than the ministerial execution of the decree as
rendered is left to be clone, the decree is interlocu-
tory, and not final, even though it settles the equi-
ties of the bill. Lodge v. Twell, 135 U.S. 232, 10
S.Ct. 745, 34 L.Ed. 153.. The difficulty of exact
definition is mentioned in McGourkey v. Ry. Co.,
146 U.S. 536, 13 S.Ct. 170, 36 L.Ed. 1079. See, also,
Keystone Manganese & Iron Co. v. Martin, 132 U.
S. 91, 10 S.Ct. 32, 33 L.Ed. 275; Leyhe v. McNam-

not to constitute a statutory dedication. Board of
Com'rs of Garfield County v. Anderson, 167 Okl.
253, 29 P.2d 75, 78.
Express or Implied
A dedication may be express, as where the in-
tention to dedicate is expressly manifested by a
deed or an explicit oral or written declaration of
the owner, or some other explicit manifestation of
his purpose to devote the land to the public use.
An implied dedication may be shown by some act
or course of conduct on the part of the owner from
which a reasonable inference of intent may be
drawn, or which is inconsistent with any other
theory than that he intended a dedication. Hurley
v. West St. Paul, 83 Minn. 401, 86 N.W. 427; Por-
ter v. City of Stuttgart, 135 Ark. 48, 204 S.W. 607,

Brownsville v. West, Tex.Civ.App., 149 S.W.2d
1034, 1037, 1038.
Common-Law or Statutory
A common-law dedication is one made as above
described, and may be either express or implied.
A statutory dedication is one made under and in
conformity with the provisions of a statute regu-
lating the subject, and is of course necessarily ex-
press. Poindexter v. Schaffner, Tex.Civ.App., 162
S.W. 22, 23; Kaufman v. City of Butte, 48 Mont.
400, 138 P. 770, 771; Neill v. City of Glendale, 106
Cal.App. 553, 289 P. 877, 879.

of lots by reference to plat constitutes common-law "dedi-
cation." Byam v. Kansas City Public Service Co., 328 Mo.
In Copyright Law

ings & Loan Corporation, C.C.A.Va., 120 F.2d 537,

lawful. It was usual for the people to feast and to
drink on those days. Cowell.
DEDIMUS ET CONCESSIMUS: (Lat. We have
given and granted.) Words used by the king, or
where there were more grantors than one, in-
stead of dedi et concessi.

er.) In English practice. A writ or commission
issuing out of chancery, empowering the persons
named therein to perform certain acts, as to ad-
minister oaths to defendants in chancery and take

tices of the peace, etc. 3 Bl.Comm. 447. It was
anciently allowed for many purposes not now in
use, as to make an attorney, to take the acknowl-
edgment of a fine, etc.

timony is sometimes termed a "dedimus potesta-
tem." Buddicum v. Kirk, 3 Cranch, 293, 2 L.Ed.

Southwest Realty Co. v. McColgan, 53 Cal.App.
2d 549, 128 P.2d 86, 87, or; a deductible loss. Hel-
vering v. Gordon, C.C.A.4, 134 F.2d 685, 689; Bick-
erstaff v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, C.C.

## DEDUCTION

That which is deducted; the part

Cal., 42 F.Supp. 884, 885; Pittsburgh Brewing Co.
v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, C.C.A.3, 107
F.2d 155, 156.
In Probate Law
By "deduction" is understood a portion or thing
which an heir has a right to take from the mass
of the succession before any partition takes place.
Civil Code La. art. 1358.
Taxation
As used in Internal Revenue Code, relating to
tax on corporations, "deduction" refers to items
which may be subtracted from a corporation's
gross income in arriving at net income. McKesson
& Robbins v. Walsh, 130 Conn. 460, 35 A.2d 865.
An amount refunded by corporation to federal govern-
ment under Renegotiation Act as excess profits from war
contracts is not a "deduction" from corporation's gross in-
come subject to state taxation, but must be considered in
determining corporation's true gross income. Southern
Weaving Co. v. Query, 206 S.C. 307, 34 S.E.2d 51, 54.
Trial

W.2d 1238, 1242.

## DEDUCTION FOR NEW

In marine insurance.

ers on the cost of repairing a vessel for damage

were before the damage.

## DEED

A conveyance of realty, a writing signed
by grantor, whereby title . to realty is transferred
from one to another. National Fire Ins. Co. v.
Patterson, 170 Okl. 593, 41 P.2d 645, 647; Mitchell
v. Nicholson, 71 N.D. 521, 3 N.W.2d 83, 85, 139
A.L.R. 1175.
In order that an instrument may be operative as a
"deed," it must pass a present interest, although it is not
necessary that grantee take a present estate in property
conveyed. Blair v. Blair, 111 Vt. 53, 10 A.2d 188, 189.
The term is also used as synonymous with
"fact," "actuality," or "act of parties." Thus a
thing "in deed" is one that has been really or ex-
pressly done; as opposed to "in law," which means
that it is merely implied or presumed to have been
done. Powell v. Powell, 196 Ga. 694, 27 S.E.2d
393, 396, 397.
At Common Law
At common law, a sealed instrument, containing
a contract or covenant, delivered by the party to
be bound thereby, and accepted by the party to
whom the contract or covenant runs. Co. Litt.
171; 2 Bl.Comm. 295; Shepp. Touchst. 50. A writ-
ing containing a contract sealed and delivered.

strument in writing, upon paper or parchment,
between parties able to contract, subscribed, seal-
ed, and delivered. 4 Kent, Comm. 452; Interstate
R. Co. v. Roberts, 127 Va. 688, 105 S.E. 463, 464.
There is authority, however, that signing is un-
necessary to validity of deed. Bowling v. Wil-
kerson, D.C.Ky., 19 F.Supp. 584, 587.
A writing under seal by which lands, tenements,
or hereditaments are conveyed for an estate not
less than freehold. 2 Bl.Comm, 294.
A dded implies, at common law, a sealed instru-
ment. 2 Bl.Comm. 295; Rondot v. Rogers Tp., 39
C.C.A. 462, 99 F. 202, 209; Strain v. Fitzgerald, 128
N.C. 396, 38 S.E. 929, 930; Williams v. State, 25
Fla. 734, 6 So. 831, 832, 6 L.R.A. 821; e. g., a bond
is a deed for the reason that it is sealed by the
obligor. In re Contest of Election of Burns, 315
Pa. 23, 171 A. 888, 889. But the term Is also applied
to similar instruments, not under seal, executed
in jurisdictions in which the use of seals is un-
known (see Steigenberger v. Carr, 3 M. & G., 191,
199, 42 ECL 107, 133 Reprint. 1111), or in which
seals have been rendered unnecessary by statute.
See Henderson v. Howard, 147 Ga. 371, 94 S.E.
251; Gibbs v. McGuire, 70 Miss. 646, 12 So. 829.
Modern Rule
A written instrument, signed, sealed, and deliv-
ered, by which one person conveys land, tene-
ments, or hereditaments to another. This is its
ordinary modern meaning, at least in those juris-
dictions which adhere to the common-law rule
making a seal essential to the validity and opera-
tive effect of a deed of conveyance. McMee v
Henry, 163 Ky. 729, 174 S.W. 746, 747; Dunham v.
Marsh, 52 N.J.Eq. 256, 30 A. 473, 474; Hood v.
Fletcher, 31 Ariz. 456, 254 P. 223, 224.
The term may include a mortgage of real estate. Lock-
ridge v. McCommon, 90 Tex. 234, 38 S.W. 33, 35 (citing
Hellman v. Howard, 44 Cal. 110) ; Daly v. Minnesota Loan.
& Investment Co., 43 Minn. 517, 45 N.W. 1100, 1101; Mor-
gan v. Wickliffe, 115 Ky. 226, 72 S. W. 1122. But, contra,
see Eaton v. White, 18 Wis. 517, 519; National Bank of
Columbus v. Tennessee Coal, Iron & Railroad Co., 62 Ohio
St. 564, 57 N.E. 450. Similarly a lease for years under seal
may be a deed. Hutchinson v. Bramhall, 42 N.J.Eq. 372, 7
A. 873, 875. And a lease exceeding twenty-one years is
held to be within the term. St. Vincent's Roman Catholic
Congregation of Plymouth v. Kingston Coal Co., 221 Pa.
349, 70 A. 838, 839. But a stipulation for a deed prohibit-
ing drilling for oil or gas was held not to include a lease.
Test Oil Co. v. La Tourette, 19 Old. 214, 91 P. 1025, 1029.
The essential difference between a "deed" and a "will"
is that the former passes a present interest and the latter
passes no interest until after the death of the maker.
Willis v. Fiveash, Tex.Civ.App., 297 S.W. 509, 510; Harber
v. Harber, 152 Ga. 98, 108 S.E. 526; Henderson v. Hender-
son, 210 Ala. 73, 97 So. 353, 372; Bowdoin College v. Mer-
ritt, C.C.Cal., 75 F. 480, 483. A will is "an instrument by
which a person makes a disposition of his property to take
effect after his decease, which is in its own nature ambula-
tory and revocable thir`ing his life. It is this ambulatory
quality which form's the characteristic of wills; for, though,
a disposition by deed may postpone the possession or en-
joyment, or even the vesting, until the death of the dis-
posing party, yet the postponement is in such case pro-
duced by the express terms, and does not result from the
nature of the instrument." In re Hall's Estate, 149 Cal.
143, 84 P. 839, 840; Robb v. Washington & Jefferson Col-
lege, 185 N.Y. 485, 78 N.E. 359, 361 (quoting and adopting
definition in Jarman, Wills, p. 17). The main test, how-
ever, whether a writing is a will or deed, is the animus
965; McLain v. Garrison, 39 Tex.Civ.App. 431, 88 S.W. 484,
89 S.W. 284 (citing Gillham v. Mustin, 42 Ala. 366; Tra-
wick v. Davis, 85 Ala. 345, 5 So. 83) ; Ecklar's Adm'r v.
Robinson, 96 S. W. 845, 846, 29 Ky.Law Rep. 1038. Harber
v. Harber, 152 Ga. 98, 108 S.E. 520. "Deeds" are irrevoca-
ble and take effect by delivery, while "wills" are always
revocable during testamentary capacity and take effect
only after testator's death. Self v. Self, 212 Ala. 512, 103
So. 591, 592. If a document cannot be revoked or impaired
by the grantor, it is a "deed," but if the grantor recites
an unqualified power of revocation, it is a "will." Craft v.
Moon, 201 Ala. 11, 75 So. 302, 303. An instrument purport-
ing to convey title to lands on its delivery is a deed and
not a will, though possession be deferred until the gran-
tor's death. Lovenskoild v. Casas, Tex.Civ.App., 196 S.W.
629, 631.
A deed is distinguished from a contract in that a deed
is a mere transfer of title to realty, and is the act of but
one of the parties, made pursuant to a previous contract
either in parol or in writing. Collins v. Lyon, Inc., 181 Va.
230, 24 S.E.2d 572, 579. Accordingly; want of considera-
tion of itself will not warrant setting aside a deed, though
want of consideration would be good defense to an execu-
tory contract. Lawson v. Boo, 227 Iowa 100, 287 N.W. 282,
284. However, a deed is a contract, for the purpose of
reformation in equity to make it truly speak the legally
ascertained intention of the parties. Sawyer Coal & Ice
Co. v. Kinnett-Odom Co., 192 Ga. 166, 14 S.E.2d 879, 883.
Deed for a nominal sum. In effect the same as
a deed of gift. Bertelsen v. Bertelson, 49 Cal.App.
2d 479, 122 P.2d 130, 133.
Deed in fee. A deed conveying the title to land
in fee simple with the usual covenants. Rudd v.
Savelli, 44 Ark. 152; Moody v. Spokane & U. H.
St. Ry. Co., 5 Wash. 699, 32 P. 751.
Deed indented, or indenture. In conveyancing.
A deed executed or purporting to be executed in
parts, between two or more parties, and distin-
guished by having the edge of the paper or parch-
ment on which it is written indented or cut at the
top in a particular manner. This was formerly
done at the top or side, in a line resembling the
teeth of a saw; a formality derived from the an-
cient practice of dividing chirographs; but the cut-
ting is now made either in a waving line, or more
commonly by notching or nicking the paper at the
edge. 2 Bl.Comm. 295, 296; Litt. § 370; Smith,
Cont. 12.
Deed of covenant. Covenants are sometimes
entered into by a separate deed, for title, or for the
indemnity of a purchaser or mortgagee, or for
the production of title-deeds. A covenant with a
penalty is sometimes taken for the payment of
a debt, instead of a bond with a condition, but the
legal remedy is the same in either case.
Deed of gift. A deed executed and delivered
without consideration.
Thus a conveyance to church mission board for
which board agreed to educate a relative of gran-
tors for the ministry should grantors die before
his education was completed, was not a strict
"deed of gift". Forbes v. Board of Missions of M.
E. Church, South, 17 Ca1.2d 332, 110 P.2d 3, 7.
Deed of release. One releasing property from
the incumbrance of a mortgage or similar pledge
upon payment or performance of the conditions;
more specifically, where a deed of trust to one or
more trustees has been executed, pledging real
formance of other conditions, substantially as in
the case of a mortgage, a deed of release is the
conveyance executed by the trustees, after pay-
ment or performance, for the purpose of divesting
themselves of the legal title and revesting it in
the original owner. See Swain v. McMillan, 30
Mont. 433, 76 Pac. 943.
Deed of separation. An instrument by which,
through the medium of some third person acting
as trustee, provision is made by a husband for
separation from his wife and for her separate
maintenance. Whitney v. Whitney, 15 Misc. 72,
36 N.Y.S. 891, 892.
Deed of settlement. A deed formerly used in
England for the formation of joint stock com-
panies constituting certain persons trustees of the
partnership property and containing regulations
for the management of its private affairs. They
are now regulated by articles of association.
Deed of trust. An instrument in use in many
states, taking the place and serving the uses of a
common-law mortgage, by which the legal title to
real property is placed in one or more trustees, to
secure the repayment of a sum of money or the
performance of other conditions. Bank v. Pierce,
144 Cal. 434, 77 P. 1012; In re Sherman, D.C.Va.,
12 F.Supp. 297, 298, 299. Though differing in form
from mortgage, it is essentially a security. Bank
of America Nat. Trust & Savings Ass'n v. Bank
of Amador County, 135 Cal.App. 714, 28 P.2d 86,
88. In re Title Guaranty Trust Co., Mo.App., 113
S.W.2d 1053, 1057. See Trust Deed.
Deed poll. A deed which is made by one party
only. See Hawkins v. Corbit, 83 Okl. 275, 201 P.
649, 653. A deed in which only the party making
it executes it or binds himself by it as a deed. 3
Washb. R. P. 311. It was originally so called be-
cause the edge of the paper or parchment was
polled or cut in a straight line, wherein it was
distinguished from a deed indented or indenture.
As to a special use of this term in Pennsylvania in
colonial times, see Herron v. Dater, 120 U.S. 464,
7 S.Ct. 620, 624, 30 L.Ed. 748 (citing Evans v.
Patterson, 71 U.S. 224, 4 Wall. 224, 18 L.Ed. 393).
Deed to lead uses. A deed made before a fine
or common recovery, to show the object thereof.
As to "execution of deed," see Execution of In-
strument.
Gratuitous deed. One made without considera-
tion. 2 Steph.Com. 47. As to "Quitclaim" deed,
"Tax" deed, "Trust" deed, and "Warranty" deed,
see those titles.

## DEED, ESTOPPEL BY

Such as arises from the
provisions of a deed. Erickson v. Wiper, 33 N.D.
193, 157 N.W. 592, 598; Green v. Clark, 13 Vt. 158;
Reinhard v. Virginia Lead Min. Co., 107 Mo. 616,
18 S.W. 17, 28 Am.St.Rep. 441.
A preclusion against the competent parties to a valid
sealed contract and their privies to deny its force and ef-
fect by any evidence of inferior solemnity. Hart v. Ana-
conda Copper Mining Co., 69 Mont. 354, 222 P. 419, 421.
Such an estoppel occurs where a party has executed a
deed, that. is, a writing under seal (as a bond) reciting a
certain fact, and is thereby precluded from afterwards
denying, in any action brought upon that instrument, the
fact so recited. Steph,P1. 197. A man shall always be
estopped by his own deed, or not permitted to aver or
prove anything in contradiction to what he has once so
solemnly and deliberately avowed. 2 Bl.Comm. 295; Plowd.
434; Hudson v. Winslow Tp., 35 N.J.Law, 441; Taggart
v. Risley, 4 Or. 242; Appeal of Waters, 35 Pa. 526, 78 Am.
Dec. 354.
A warranty deed by one having only a contingent re-
mainder passes title, by way of "estoppel" to grantee, as
soon as remainder vests by happening of contingency.
Thames v. Goode, 217 N.C. 639, 9 S.E.2d 485, 488.
"Estoppel by deed" is a bar precluding party from deny-
ing truth of his deed. Talley v. Howsley, Tex.Civ.App.,
170 S.W.2d 240, 243. It is limited to an action founded on
the deed itself. Hughes v. Cobb, 195 Ga. 213, 23 S.E.2d 701,
715. It applies to the maker of the deed, and does not
ordinarily apply to the grantee. Hughes v. Cobb, 195 Ga.
213, 23 S.E.2d 701, 715. It arises only when suit is on the
deed or concerning a right arising out of the deed and be-
tween parties or privies to the deed. Robert v. O'Connell,
269 Mass. 532, 169 N.E. 487, 488. It arises only where there
is express representation as to ownership, title% or interest
in question, or where there are express warranties thereto.
Petition of Testan, 156 Misc. 449, 281 N.Y.S. 96. It cannot
be invoked by one through whose imposition a statement
was inserted in the deed. Capitol Nat. Bank & Trust Co. v.
David B. Roberts, Inc., 129 Conn. 194, 27 A.2d 116, 119, 141
A.L.R. 1179. It precludes a party thereto and his privies
as against other party and his privies. Sammons v. Brun-
son, Tex.Civ.App., 25 S.W.2d 685, 688.
A distinct and precise assertion or admission of fact is
necessary. Cook v. Farley, 195 Miss. 638, 15 So.2d 352, 357.
Inducement to change course to one's disadvantage is
essential. Funderburk v. Magnolia Sugar Co-op., La.App.,
8 So.2d 374, 377.
The effect of doctrine is same as if in deed itself, there
had been inserted express provision that it conveyed not
only all title then possessed but all that might there-
after be acquired. Meyers v. American Oil Co., 192 Miss.
180, 5 So.2d 218, 220.

## DEEM

To hold; consider; adjudge; condemn;
determine; treat as if; construe. Douglas v.
Edwards, C.C.A.N.Y., 298 F. 229, 237; In re
Schmidt's Estate, 134 Wash. 525, 236 P. 274, 275;
In re Green's Estate, 99 Misc. 582, 164 N.Y.S. 1063,
1083; Harder v. Irwin, D.C.N.Y., 285 F. 402, 404;
First Nat. Bank v. Dodd, 118 Or. 1, 245 P. 503, 504.
But see Kleppe v. Odin Tp., McHenry County, 40
N.D. 595, 169 N.W. 313, 314, which gives "deemed"
the force of only a "disputable presumption," or
of prima facie evidence. When, by statute, cer-
tain acts are "deemed" to be a crime of a par-
ticular nature, they are such crime, and not a
semblance of it, nor a mere fanciful approxima-
tion to or designation of the offense. Com. v.
Pratt, 132 Mass. 247; Commonwealth v. Brue, 284
Pa. 294, 131 A. 367, 368.

## DEEMSTERS

Judges in the Isle of Man, who
decide all controversies without process, writings,
or any charges. These judges are chosen by the
people, and are said by Spelman to be two in num-
ber. Spelman.

## DEER-FALD

A park or fold for deer.

## DEER-HAYES

Engines or great nets made of
cord to catch deer. 19 Hen. VIII, c. 11.

## DEFACE

To mar or destroy the face (that is,
the physical appearance of written or inscribed
characters as expressive of a definite meaning) of
a written instrument, signature, inscription, etc.,
by obliteration, erasure, cancellation, or superin-
scription, so as to render it illegible or unrecogniz-
able. Linney v. State, 6 Tex. 1, 55 Am.Dec. 756.
See Cancel. In re Parsons' Will, 195 N.Y.S. 742,
745, 119 Misc. 26. Also used in respect of injury
to monument, buildings and other structures. Saf-
fell v. State, 113 Ark. 97, 167 S.W. 483. So, to de-
face the flag carries the meaning of dishonor,
which imputes a lively sense of shaming or an
equivalent acquiescent callousness. State v.
Schlueter, 127 N.J.L. 496, 23 A.2d 249, 251,
DE FACTO. In fact; actually; indeed; in reality.
Ridout v. State, 161 Tenn. 248, 30 S.W.2d 255, 257,
71 A.L.R. 830. Thus, an office, position or status
existing under a claim or color of right such as a
deputy county clerk. Heron v. Gaylor, 49 N.M. 62,
157 P.2d 239, 241; deputy clerk of court. State
v. Brandon, 186 S.C. 448, 197 S.E. 113, 115; cor-
porate office. In re Hillmark Associates, D.C.N.
Y., 47 F.Supp. 605, 606; corporation, Municipal
Bond & Mortgage Corporation v. Bishop's Harbor

iff, Malone v. Howell, 140 Fla. 693, 192 So. 224,

Mitchell v. Armspach, 314 Ill.App. 573, 41 N.E.2d
781; trustee, In re Wohl's Estate, 36 N.Y.S.2d 926,.

## DE FACTO GOVERNMENT

One that maintains
itself by a display of force against the will of the
rightful legal government and is successful, at
least temporarily, in overturning the institutions
of the rightful legal government by setting up its
own in lieu thereof. Wortham v. Walker, 133
Tex. 255, 128 S.W.2d 1138, 1145.

## DEFALCATION

The act of a defaulter; mis-
appropriation of trust funds or money held in any
fiduciary capacity; failure to properly account for
such funds. Usually spoken of officers of corpo-
rations or public officials. In re Butts, D.C.N.Y.,
120 F. 970; Crawford v. Burke, 201 Ill. 581, 66 N.E.
Also set-off. The diminution of a debt or claim,
by deducting from it a smaller claim held by the
debtor or payor. Iron Works v. Cuppey, 41
Iowa, 104; Houk v. Foley, 2 Pen. & W., Pa., 250;
McDonald v. Lee, 12 La. 435.
Colloquially, perhaps, the worn "defalcation" ordinarily
implies some moral dereliction. As used in the Bankruptcy
Act, it may demand some portion of misconduct, but it is
ceiver in a mortgage foreclosure suit in withdrawing and
spending an amount allowed him by an order passing his
intermediate account without waiting for the time for ap-
peal to expire or consulting plaintiff as to whether it In-
tended to appeal, is a "defalcation". Central Hanover
Bank & Trust Co. v. Herbst, C.C.A.X.Y., 93 F.2d 510, 511,
512, 114 A.L.R. 769.

## DEFALK

To set off one claim against another;
to deduct a debt due to one from a debt which
one owes. Johnson v. Signal Co., 57 N.J.Eq. 79, 40
A. 193; Burris v. Boone, 4 Boyce, Del., 148, 86 A.
730. This verb corresponds only to the second
meaning of "defalcation" as given above; a pub-
lic officer or trustee who misappropriates or em-
bezzles funds in his hands is not said to "defalk."
DEFAMACAST. Defamation by broadcast. Amer-
ican Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres, Inc. v.
Simpson, 126 S.E.2d 873, 879, 106 Ga.App. 230.

## DEFAMATION

The taking from one's reputa-
tion. The offense of injuring 'a person's charac-
ter, fame, or reputation by false and malicious
statements. The term seems to include both libel
and slander. In general, see Shaw Cleaners & Dy-
ers v. Des Moines Dress Club, 215 Iowa, 1130, 245
N.W. 231, 86 A.L.R. 839; Snavely v. Booth, 6 W.
W.Harr. 378, 176 A. 649; Washer v. Bank of Amer-
ica Nat. Trust & Savings Ass'n, 128 P.2d 799. Li-
bel. Seested v. Post Printing & Publishing Co.,
326 Mo. 559, 31 S.W.2d 1045, 1052, Slander. Con-
nelly v. McKay, 176 Misc, 685, 28 N.Y.S.2d 327, 329.
The distinction between "criticism" and "defamation" is
that criticism deals only with such things as invite public
attention or call for public comment, and does not follow
a man into his private life, or pry into his domestic con-
cerns, and it never attacks the individual, but only his
work. Schwimmer v, Commercial Newspaper Co., 131 Misc.
552, 228 N.Y.S. 220, 221.
The fundamental difference between a right to "privacy"
and a right to freedom from "defamation" is that the
former directly concerns one's own peace of mind whereas
the latter concerns primarily one's reputation. Themo v.
New England Newspaper Pub. Co., 306 Mass. 54, 27 N.E.2d
753, 755.

## DEFAMATORY

Calumnious; containing de-
famation; injurious to reputation; libelous;
slanderous; words which produce any perceptible
injury to the reputation of another. Sheridan V.
Davies, 139 Kan. 256, 31 P.2d 51, 54.

## DEFAMATORY PER QUOD

In respect of
words: Those which require an allegation of facts,
aside from the words contained in the article, by
way of innuendo, to show wherein the words used
libel the plaintiff, in order to state a cause of ac-
tion in a complaint. Rowan v. Gazette Printing
Co., 74 Mont. 326, 239 P. 1035, 1037.

## DEFAMATORY PER SE

In respect of words:
Those which by themselves, and as such, without
reference to extrinsic proof, injure the reputation
of the person to whom they are applied. Manley
v. Harer, 73 Mont. 253, 235 P. 757, 758; Conrad v.
Allis-Chalmers Mfg. Co., 228 Mo.App. 817, 73 S.
W.2d 438, 446.

## DEFAMES

L. Fr, Infamous. Britt. c. 15.

## DEFAULT

By its derivation, a failure. Mead-
ows v. Continental Assur. Co., C.C.A.Tex., 89 F.
2d 256. An omission of that which ought to be
2d 203, 205. Specifically, the omission or failure
to perform a legal duty. Easterwood v. Willing-
ham, Tex.Civ.App., 47 S.W.2d 393, 395; to observe
a promise or discharge an obligation, Bradbury v.
Thomas, 27 P.2d 402, 135 Cal.App. 435; or to per-
form an agreement, Eastman v. Morgan, D.C.N.Y.,
43 F.Supp. 637, 641. The term also embraces the
idea of dishonesty, In re State, 210 Wis. 9, 245 N.
W. 844, 845, and of wrongful act, Greco v. S. S.
Kresge Co., 277 N.Y. 26, 12 N.E.2d 557, 562, 115
A.L.R. 1020; or an act or omission discreditable
to one's profession, Hilkert v. Canning, 58 Ariz.
290, 119 P.2d 233, 236,
In Practice
Omission; neglect or failure of any party to take
step required of him in progress of cause. Indi-
ana State Board of Medical Registration and
Examination v. Pickard, 93 Ind.App. 171, 177 N.E.
870, 872. When a defendant in an action at law
omits to plead within the time allowed him for
that purpose, or fails to appear on the trial, he is
said to make default, McCabe v. Tom, 35 Ohio
App. 73, 171 N.E. 868, 869, and the judgment en-
tered in the former case is technically called a
"judgment by default." 3 Bl.Comm. 396; 1 Tidd,
Pr. 562.
A "default" in an action at law is somewhat similar to
the entry of a decree in equity that the bill be taken for
confessed, neither being a final disposition. Felton v.
Felton, 128 Conn. 564, 196 A. 791, 793.
In General
Default of issue. Failure to have living chil-
dren or descendants at a given time or fixed point.
George v. Morgan, 16 Pa. 106; In re Van Cleef,
92 Misc. 689, 157 N.Y.S. 549, 551.
Defaulter. One who makes default. One who
misappropriates money held by him in an official
or fiduciary character, or fails to account for such
money.
Judgment by default. See Judgment.

## DEFEASANCE

An instrument which defeats
the force or operation of some other deed or es-
tate. That which is in the same deed is called a
"condition"; and that which is in another deed is
a "defeasance." Com. Dig. "Defeasance." Bein-
dorf v. Thorpe, 90 Okl. 191, 203 P. 475, 477; In re
A. Roth Co., C.C.A.I11., 118 F.2d 156, 158.
A "defeasance" is a collateral deed made at the same
time as a feoffment or other conveyance, containing certain
conditions upon the performance of which the estate then
created may be defeated or totally undone. Bach v. First
Nat. Bank, 99 Ind.App. 590, 193 N.E. 696, 697.
In Conveyancing
A collateral deed made at the same time with a
feoffment or other conveyance, containing certain
conditions, upon the performance of which th'
estate then created may be defeated or totally un-
done. 2 Bl.Comm. 327; Co. Litt. 236, 237.
An instrument accompanying a bond, recogniz-
ance, or judgment, containing a condition which,
Comm. 342; Miller v. Quick, 158 Mo. 495, 59 S.W.

## DEFEASIBLE

Subject to be defeated, annulled,
revoked, or undone upon the happening of a future
event or the performance of a condition subse-
quent, or by a conditional limitation. Usually
spoken of estates and interests in land. For in-
stance, a mortgagee's estate is defeasible (liable
to be defeated) by the mortgagor's equity of re-
demption. Penick v. Atkinson, 139 Ga. 649, 77 S.E.
1055, 1057, 46 L.R.A.,N.S., 284; Murphy v. Mur-
phy, 182 Ky. 731, 207 S.W. 491, 493.

## DEFEASIBLE FEE

An estate in fee that is li-
able to be defeated by some future contingency;
e. g., a vested remainder which might be defeated
by the death of the remainderman before the time
fixed for the taking effect of the devise. Giltner's
Trustee v. Talbott, 253 Ky. 474, 69 S.W.2d 981;
Daly v. Pate, 210 N.C. 222, 186 S.E. 348, 349.

## DEFEASIBLE TITLE

One that is liable to be
annulled or made void, but not one that is already
void or an absolute nullity. Elder v. Schumacher,
18 Colo. 433, 33 P. 175.

## DEFEASIVE

Describes counterclaim which, if
it prevails, will defeat right of plaintiffs to recover.
Hayden v. Collins, 90 Utah, 238, 63 P.2d 223, 225.

## DEFEAT

To prevent, frustrate, or circumvent;
as in the phrase "hinder, delay, or defeat credi-
tors." Coleman v. Walker, 3 Mete., Ky., 65, 77
Am.Dec. 163; Reuff-Griffin Decorating Co. v.
Wilkes, 191 S.W. 443, 446, 173 Ky. 566.
To overcome or prevail against in any contest;
as in speaking of the "defeated party" in an action
at law. Wood v. Bailey, 21 Wall. 642, 22 L.Ed.
689. Or "defeated candidate" in an election. Nor-
cop v. Jordan, 216 Cal. 764, 17 P.2d 123, 124.
To annul, undo, or terminate; as, a title or es-
tate. See Defeasible.

## DEFECT

The want or absence of some legal
requisite; deficiency; imperfection; insufficiency.
Sappenfield v. National Zinc Co., 94 Kan. 22, 145

or the way of use which is part of the condition
of the machinery itself. Caldwell-Watson Foun-
dry & Machine Co. v. Watson, 183 Ala. 326, 62 So.

tion of plaintiffs or defendants. Porter Const.
Co. v. Berry, 136 Or. 80, 298 P. 179, 182; Salisbury
v. Berry Motor Co., 122 Neb. 605, 241 N.W. 86, 87;

v. Cannon, 90 Colo. 465, 9 P.2d 1057.

## DEFENDANT

The person defending or deny-
ing; the party against whom relief or recovery
is sought in an action or suit. Graham Bros. Ak-
tiebolag v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 126
Misc. 32, 212 N.Y.S. 380, 381; Atlantic Mut. In-
surance Co. v. Alexandre, D.C.N.Y., 16 F. 279, 281;
Siekmann v. Kern, 136 La. 1068, 68 So. 128. See,
also, Ferguson v. Montgomery, 148 Ark. 83, 229
S.W. 30, 36 (election contest) ; Boyd v. Lambert,
58 Okl. 497, 160 P. 586, 587 (injunction bond) ;

Inc. v. Corn Products Refining Co., C.C.A.Ind., 103
F.2d 1, 5 (anti-trust prosecution).
Thus, railroads, on appeal by city to state district court
from order of Minnesota Railroad and Warehouse Commis-
sion requiring grade separation, were held defendants en-
St. P. & P. R. Co., D.C.Minn., 50 F.2d 430, 434.
In common usage, this term is applied to the party put
upon his defense, or summoned to answer a charge or com-
plaint, in any species of action, civil or criminal, at law or
in equity. Strictly, however, it does not apply to the per-
son against whom a real action is brought, for in that pro-
ceeding the technical usage is to call the parties respective-
ly the "demandant" and the "tenant."
Defendant in error. The distinctive term appro-
priate to the party against whom a writ of error
is sued out.
Principal defendant. One who has an interest
in the controversy presented by the bill, and
whose presence is requisite to the complete and
partial adjudication of the controversy. Bird v.

## DEFENDER OF THE FAITH

A peculiar title
belonging to the sovereign of England, as that of
"Catholic" to the king of Spain, and that of "Most
Christian" to the king of France. These titles
were originally given by the popes of Rome; and
that of Defensor Fidei was first conferred by
Pope Leo X. on King Henry VIII., as a reward
for writing against Martin Luther; and the bull
for it bears date quinto Idus Octob., 1521. Enc.
Lond,

## DEFENDERE SE PER CORPUS SUUM

To of-
fer duel or combat as a legal trial and appeal.
Abolished by 59 Geo. III. § 46. See Battel.

## DEFENDERE UNICA MANU

To wage law; a
denial of an accusation upon oath. See Wager
of Law.

## DEFENDIT VIM ET INJURIAM

He defends
the force and injury. Pieta, lib. 5, c. 39, § 1.

## DEFENDOUR

L. Fr. A defender or defendant;
the party accused in an appeal. Britt. c. 22.

## DEFENERATION

The act of lending money on
usury.

## DEFENSA

In old English law. A park or place
fenced in for deer, and defended as a property
and peculiar for that use and service. Cowell.

## DEFENSE

That which is offered and alleged
by the party proceeded against in an action or
suit, as a reason in law or fact why the plaintiff
should not recover or establish what he seeks;
what is put forward to diminish plaintiff's cause
v. Braukman, C.C.A.Colo., 70 F.2d 647, 649; Lind-
say v. State, Tex.Civ.App., 25 S.W.2d 1113, 1115.
More properly what is sufficient when offered for
this purpose. In either of these senses it may be
either a denial, justification, or confession and
avoidance of the facts averred as a ground of
action, or an exception to their sufficiency in
point of law. Whitfield v. Aetna Life Insurance
Co., C.C.Mo., 125 F. 270; Eagle Savings & Loan
Ass'n v. West, 71 Ohio App. 485, 50 N.E.2d 352,
356; Paillet v. Vroman, 52 Cal.App.2d 297, 126 P.
2d 419, 421; (challenge to jurisdiction) Trades-
mens Nat. Bank & Trust Co. v. Charlton Steam
Shipping Co., D.C.Pa., 3 F.R.D. 363, 364; (denial)
Levine v. Behn, 282 N.Y. 120, 25 N.E.2d 871, 873;
(legal insufficiency) Dysart v. Remington Rand,
D.C.Conn., 31 F.Supp. 296, 297; (payment) Hoad-
ley v. W. T. Rawleigh Co., 112 Ind.App. 563, 44 N.
E.2d 231, 232; (statute of limitations) Waggoner
v. Feeney, 220 Ind. 543, 44 N.E.2d 499, 502.
In a stricter sense, defense is used to denote
the answer made by the defendant to the plain-
tiff's action, by demurrer or plea at law or an-
swer in equity. This is the meaning of the term
in Scotch law. Ersk. Inst. 4, 1, 66. However, it
has been held that the filing of a demurrer is not
the making of a defense within meaning of the
statute providing that, if no defense be made,
the plaintiff cannot have judgment for any relief
not specifically demanded, but, if defense be made,
he may have judgment for other relief, under a
prayer therefor. Union Light, Heat & Power Co.
v. City of Bellevue, 284 Ky. 405, 144 S.W.2d 1046,
Half defense was that which was made by the form "de-
fends the force and injury, and says," (defendit vim et in-
juriam, et dicit.)
Full defense was that which was made by. the form "de-
fends the force and injury when and where it shall behoove
him, and the damages, and whatever else he ought to de-
fend," (defendit vim et injuriam quando et ubi curia con-
sideravit, et damna et quicquid quod ipse defendere debet,
et dicit,) commonly shortened into "defends the force and
injury when," etc. Gi1b.Com.P1. 188; 8 Term, 632; 3 Bos.
& P. 9, note; Co.Litt. 127b.
In matrimonial suits, in England, defenses are divided
into absolute, i. e., such as, being established to the satis-
faction of the court, are a complete answer to the petition,
so that the court can exercise no discretion, but is bound
to dismiss the petition; and discretionary, or such as, be-
ing established, leave to the court a discretion whether it
will pronounce a decree or dismiss the petition. Thus, in
a suit for dissolution, condonation is an absolute, adultery
by the petitioner a discretionary, defense. Browne, Div.
Defense is not something by means of which
party who interposes it can obtain relief for him-
self. Crisman v. Corbin, 169 Or. 332, 128 P.2d
959, 964.
Defense, as respects right to counsel to conduct
defense of one charged with crime, includes every
step in proceedings from time of arraignment until
acquittal or conviction. State v. Hudson, 55 R.I.
141, 179 A. 130, 135, 100 A.L.R. 313.
Defense also means the forcible repelling of an
attack made unlawfully with force and violence,
such as the defense of the nation in time of war.
United States v. 243.22 Acres of Land in Village
ty, N. Y., D.C.N.Y., 43 F.Supp. 561, 567.
In old statutes and records, the term means pro-
hibition; denial or refusal. Enconter le defense
et le commandement de Toy; against the prohibi-
tion and commandment of the king. St. Westm.
1, c. 1. Also a state of severalty, or of several or
exclusive occupancy; a state of inclosure.
Affidavit of Defense
See Affidavit.
Affirmative Defense
See that title.
Equitable Defense
See that title.
Frivolous Defense
One which at first glance can be seen to be
merely pretensive, setting up some ground which
cannot be sustained by argument. Dominion
Nat. Bank v. Olympia Cotton Mills, C.C.S.C., 128
F. 182.
Legal Defense
(1) A defense which is complete and adequate
in point of law. (2) A defense which may be
set up in a court of law; as distinguished from
an "equitable defense," which is cognizable only
in a court of equity or court possessing equitable
powers,
Meritorious Defense
One going to the merits, substance, or essen-
tials of the case, as distinguished from dilatory
or technical objections. Cooper v. Lumber Co.,
61 Ark. 36, 31 S.W. 981.
Partial Defense
One which goes only to a part of the cause of
action, or which only tends to mitigate the dam-
ages to be awarded. Carter v. Bank, 33 Misc. 128,
67 N.Y.S. 300.
Peremptory Defense
A defense which insists that the plaintiff never
had the right to institute the suit, or that, if he
had, the original right is extinguished or deter-
mined. 4 Bouv. Inst. No. 4206.
Personal Defense
In negotiable instruments law. A defense
which, though not good as against a holder in
due course, is good against certain parties, be-
cause of their participation in or knowledge of
certain transactions or facts from which such de-
fense arises. Such defenses include all defenses
that are not real or absolute defenses. Bauer
and Simpson, Law of Business, 2d Ed., p. 329.
Pretermitted Defense
One which was available to a party and of
which he might have had the benefit if he had
pleaded it in due season, but which cannot after-
wards be heard as a basis for affirmative relief.
Swennes v. Sprain, 120 Wis. 68, 97 N.W. 511.
Real Defense
In negotiable instruments law. A defense in-
herent in the res and therefore good against
anyone seeking to enforce the instrument, even a
holder in due course. Real defenses include il-
legality, incapacity, forgery, material alteration,
nondelivery of an incomplete instrument, and
fraud in the inception. These defenses are good
even against a holder in due course because,
where they exist, no contract was formed. Bauer
and Simpson, Law of Business, 2d Ed., p. 330.
Sham Defense
A false or fictitious defense, interposed in bad
faith, and manifestly untrue, insufficient, or ir-
relevant on its face.
Self Defense
See that title.

## DEFENSIVE ALLEGATION

In English ecclesi-
astical law. A species of pleading, where the de-
fendant, instead of denying the plaintiff's charge
upon oath, has any circumstances to offer in his
defense. This entitles him, in his turn, to the
,
plaintiff's answer upon oath, upon which he may
proceed to proofs as well as his antagonist. 3 Bl.
Comm. 100; 3 Steph. Comm. 720.

## DEFENSIVE WAR

A war in defense of, or for
the protection of, national rights. It may be
defensive in its principles, though offensive in
its operations. 1 Kent, Comm. 50, note.

## DEFENSO

That part of any open field or place
that was allotted for corn or hay, and upon which
there was no common or feeding, was anciently
said to be in defenso; so of any meadow ground
that was laid in for hay only. The same term
was applied to a wood where part was inclosed or
fenced, to secure the growth of the underwood
from the injury of cattle. Cowell.

amount, and the lighter species of offenses. Cod.
1, 55, 1; Nov. 15, c. 3, § 2; Id. c. 6, § 1: He had
also the care of the public records, and powers
similar to those of a notary in regard to the exe-
cution of wills and conveyances.
Defensor fidei. Defender of the faith. See De-
fender.

## DEFENSUM

A prohibition. An inclosure of
land; any fenced ground. Medley, Eng. Const.
Hist. See Defenso.

## DEFER

a future time. The term does not have, however,
the meaning of abolish, Moore v. Sampson Coun-
ty, 220 N.C. 232, 17 S.E.2d 22, 23, or omit, United
States v. Murine Co., C.C.A.Ill., 90 F.2d 549, 551.

## DEFICIENCY

A lack, shortage or insufficiency.
The amount by which the income tax imposed
exceeds the amount shown as the tax by the tax-
payer upon his return. American Woolen Co. v.
United States, Ct.C1., 21 F.Supp. 1021, 1022.
That part of a debt secured by mortgage not
realized from sale of mortgaged property. Har-
row v Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 285 Mich. 349,
280 N.W. 785, 787. A judgment or decree for the
amount of such deficiency is called a "deficiency
judgment" or "decree." Phillips v. Union Central
Life Ins. Co.., C.C.A.Minn., 88 F.2d 188, 189 (judg-
ment) ; Grace v. Hendricks, 103 Fla. 1158, 140 So.
790, 794 (decree).
Technically speaking, there is no such thing under our
law as a "deficiency judgment" in the sense that a formal
judgment of that description is rendered by the court, or
entered by the clerk for the amount not made by the sale
of the mortgaged property. There is only the original
judgment for the full amount of the indebtedness, upon
which a deficiency may exist after the issuance and return
of the special execution, or even perhaps of one or more
general executions in addition. It has nevertheless been
customary in ordinary parlance to refer to the amount still
due after the return of the special execution as a "deficien-
cy judgment." Bank of Douglas v. Neel, 30 Ariz. 375, 247
P. 132, 134.

## DEFICIENCY BILL

In parliamentary practice,
an appropriation bill covering items of expense
omitted from the general appropriation bill or
bills, or for which insufficient appropriations were
made. If intended to cover a variety of sFch
items, it is commonly called a "general deficiency
bill;" if intended to make provision for expenses
which must be met immediately, or which cannot
wait the ordinary course of the general appropria-
tion bills, it is called an "urgent deficiency bill."
Deficiente uno sanguine non potest esse hares,
3 Coke, 41. One blood being wanting, he cannot
be heir. But see 3 & 4 Wm. IV. c. 106, § 9, and
33 & 34 Viet. c. 23, § 1.

## DEFICIT

Something wanting, generally in the .
accounts of one intrusted with money, or in the
money received by him. Mutual L. & B. Ass'n v.
Price, 19 Fla. 135. The term is broad enough to
cover defalcation, misappropriation, shrinkage, or
costs, and, in its popular meaning, signifies de-
ficiency from any cause. Clement v. Whisnant,
208 N.C. 167, 179 S.E. 430, 433, 101 A.L.R. 698.

## DEFILE

To debauch, deflower, or corrupt the
chastity of a woman. The term does not neces-
sarily imply force or ravishment, nor does it con-
note previous immaculateness. State v. Fernald,
88 Iowa, 553, 55 N.W. 534; State v. Besares, 73
Utah 141, 283 P. 738, 739. The term, when used
in a statute penalizing any person who shall pub-
licly defile any flag of the United States, has the
meaning of dishonor. State v. Schlueter, 127 N.
J.L. 496, 23 A.2d 249, 251.

## DEFILEMENT

Uncleanness; impurity; corrup-
tion of morals or conduct. Young v. State, 194
Ind. 221, 141 N.E. 309, 311,
DEFINE. To explain or state the exact meaning
of words and phrases; to state explicitly; to
limit; to determine essential qualities of; to de-
termine the precise signification of; to settle; to
establish or prescribe authoritatively; to make
clear. U. S. v. Smith, 5 Wheat. 160, 5 L.Ed. 57;
Walling v. Yeakley, C.C.A.Colo., 140 F.2d 830, 832;
Walters v. Richardson, 93 Ky. 374, 20 S.W. 279.
To declare that a certain act shall constitute an
offense is defining that offense. U. S. v. Arjona,
120 U.S. 488, 7 S.Ct. 628, 30 L.Ed. 728.
To "define" with respect to space, means to set
or establish its boundaries authoritatively; to
mark the limits of; to determine with precision
or to exhibit clearly the boundaries of; to deter-
mine the end or limit; to fix or establish the lim-
its. It is the equivalent to declare, fix or estab-
lish. Seeking out what exists already is not "de-
fining." Redlands Foothill Groves v. Jacobs, D.C.
Cal., 30 F.Supp. 995, 1004.

## DEFINITE

Fixed, determined, defined, bounded.
Board of Sup'rs of Yavapai County v. Stephens,
20 Ariz. 115, 177 P. 261, 262; Kintner v. Atlantic
Communication Co., C.C.A.N.Y., 240 F. 716, 721.
A definite failure of issue occurs when a precise time is
fixed by a will for a failure of issue. An indefinite failure
of issue Is the period when the issue of the first taker shall
become extinct and when there shall no longer be any is-
sue of the grantee, but without reference to a particular
time or event; Huxford v. Milligan, 50 Ind. 546; McWil-
liams v. Havely, 214 Ky. 320, 283 S.W. 103, 105.

## DEFINITIO

Lat. Definition, or more strictly,
limiting or bounding; as in the maxim of the
civil law: Omnis definitio periculosa est, parum
est enim ut non subverti possit, (Dig. 50, 17, 202;)
e., the attempt to bring the law within the
boundaries of precise definitions is hazardous, as
there are but few cases in which such a limitation
cannot be subverted.

## DEFINITION

A description of a thing by its
properties; an explanation of the meaning of a
word or term. Webster. The process of stating
the exact meaning of a word by means of other
words. Worcester. See Warner v. Beers, 23
Wend., N.Y., 103; Marvin v. State, 19 Ind. 181.
Such a description of the thing defined, including
all essential elements and excluding all nonessen-
tial, as to distinguish it from all other things and
classes. Wilson v. Else, 204 Iowa 857, 216 N.W.
33, 37.

## DEFINITIVE

That which finally and completely
ends and settles a controversy. A definitive sen-
tence or judgment is put in opposition to an in-
terlocutory judgment. Thompson v. Graham, 246
Pa. 202, 92 A. 118, 119; Interstate Electric Co. v.
Interstate Electric Co. of Shreveport, La.App., 6
So.2d 39, 40.
A distinction may be taken between a final and a defini-
tive judgment. The former term is applicable when the
judgment exhausts the powers of the particular court in
which it is rendered; while the latter word designates a
judgment that is above any review or contingency of re-
versal. U. S. v. The Peggy, 1 Cranch, 103, 2 L.Ed. 49.

## DEFINITIVE SENTENCE

The final judgment,
decree, or sentence of an ecclesiastical court. 3
Bl.Comm. 101.

straight or horizontal line or from a proper posi-
tion, to swerve, to deviate. Grip Nut Co. v. Mac-
Lean-Fogg Lock Nut Co., D.C.I11., 34 F.2d 41, 42.

Conn. 212.
In Scotch Law
To resist the execution of the law; to oppose
by force a public officer in the execution of his
duty. Bell.

## DEFORCEMENT

Deforcement is where a man
wrongfully holds lands to which another person
is entitled. It therefore includes disseisin, abate-
ment, discontinuance, and intrusion. Co. Litt.
277b, 331b; Hopper v. Hopper, 21 N.J.L. 543. But
it is applied especially to cases, not falling under
those heads, where the person entitled to the free-
hold has never had possession; thus, where a lord
has a seignory, and lands escheat to him propter
defectum sanguinis, but the seisin is withheld
from him, this is a deforcement, and the person
who withholds the seisin is called a "deforceor."
3 Bl.Comm. 172.

gers or other public officers while they are actual-
ly engaged in the exercise of their offices. Ersk.
Inst. 4, 4, 32.

In insurance. Representations in application for
insurance that applicant never had any "infirmity"
or "deformity" must be construed as meaning de-
formity or infirmity of substantial character ap-
parently materially impairing applicant's health,
which, if known, probably would have deterred
company from issuing policy. (Life insurance)
Eastern Dist. Piece Dye Works v. Travelers' Ins.
Co., 234 N.Y. 441, 138 N.E. 401, 404, 405, 26 A.L.R.

## DEGRADATION

A deprivation of dignity; dis-

ments and rights which are the ensigns of his
degree. Degradation is otherwise called "deposi-
tion," but the canonists have distinguished be-
tween these two terms, deeming the former as
the greater punishment of the two. There is like-
wise a degradation of a lord or knight at common
law, and also by act of parliament. Wharton.

cially ecclesiastical,) but in later use was reserved
as an assertion of "the divine right of kings."
DEI JUDICIUM. The judgment of God. The old
Saxon trial by ordeal, so called because it was
thought to be an appeal to God for the justice of
a cause, and it was believed that the decision was
according to the will and pleasure of Divine Prov-
idence. Wharton.

C.A.Tex., 76 F.2d 766, 769; State v. Magnolia Pe-
troleum Co., Tex.Civ.App., 173 S.W.2d 186, 190.

any. People v. Herbert, 162 Misc. 817, 295 N.Y.S.
251, 253. The doctrine does not apply to corpora-
tions. Adams v. St. Clair, 185 Miss. 416, 188 So.
559, 560.
In Scotch Law
The personal preference which is supposed to
have been exercised by a landlord in selecting his

In the Civil Law
A species of novation which consists in the
change of one debtor for another, when he who is
indebted substitutes a third person who obligates
himself in his stead to the creditor, or to the per-
son appointed by him so that the first debtor is
acquitted and his obligation extinguished, and the
creditor contents himself with the obligation of
the second. debtor. Delegation is essentially dis-
tinguished from any other species of novation,
in this: that the former demands the consent of
all three parties, but the latter that only of the
two parties to the new debt. 1 Domat, § 2318;
Adams v. Power, 48 Miss. 454.
Delegation is novation effected by the interven-
tion of another person whom the debtor, in order
to be liberated from his creditor, gives to such
creditor, or to him whom the creditor appoints;
and such person so given becomes obliged to the
creditor in the place of the original debtor.
Burge, Sur. 173.
Perfect delegation exists when the debtor who makes the
obligation is discharged by the creditor.
Imperfect delegation exists when the creditor retains his
rights against the original debtor. 2 Duvergnoy, n. 169.
Delegatus non potest delegare. A delegate can-
not delegate; an agent cannot delegate his func-
tions to a subagent without the knowledge or con-
sent of the principal; the person to whom an office
or duty is delegated cannot lawfully devolve the

so to do. 9 Coke, 77; Broom, Max. 840; 2 Kent,
Comm. 633; 2 Steph.Comm. 119; Blake v. Allen,
221 N.C. 445, 20 S.E.2d 552, 554.

shell in oysters constitute "deleterious substances". Unit-
ed States v. 1232 Cases American Beauty Brand Oysters,
D.C.Mo., 43 F.Supp. 749, 751.

## DELF

A quarry or mine. 31 Eliz. c. 7.
Deliberandum est diu quod statuendum est
semel. 12 Coke, 74. That which is to be resolved
once for all should be long deliberated upon.

## DELIBERATE

To weigh, ponder, discuss, re-
gard upon, consider. Cole v. List & Weatherly
Const. Co., La.App., 156 So. 88, 90. To examine,
to consult, in order to form an opinion. McGregor
v. State, 83 Tex.Cr.R. 35, 201 S.W. 184, 186. To
weigh in the mind; to consider the reasons for
and against; to consider maturely; reflect upon;
as to deliberate a question; to weigh the argu-

7, 17, 18.

sidered; not sudden or rash; circumspect; slow
in determining. McClendon v. Louisiana Cent.
Lumber Co., 17 La.App. 246, 135 So. 754, 756.

90. Formed, arrived at, or determined upon as a
result of careful thought and weighing of con-
siderations, as a deliberate judgment or plan;

facts and arguments with a view to a choice or
decision; careful in considering the consequences
of a step; slow in action; unhurried; character-
ized by reflection; dispassionate; not rash. Peo-
ple v. Thomas, 25 Ca1.2d 880, 156 P.2d 7, 17, 18.
The word carries with it an implication of some
obstinacy, headstrongness, foolish daring, or in-
tentional wrongdoing. Brown v. Kansas City
Bridge Co., La.App., 191 So. 755, 757.
By the use of this word, in describing a crime, the idea
is conveyed that the perpetrator weighs the motives for the
act and its consequences, the nature of the crime, or other
things connected with his intentions, with a view to a de-
cision thereon; that he carefully considers all these; and
that the act is not suddenly committed. It implies that the
perpetrator must be capable of the exercise of such mental
powers as are called into use by deliberation and the con-
sideration and weighing of motives and consequences. In
re Nunns, 188 App.Div. 424, 176 N.Y.S. 858, 865; Jenkins
v. Carman Mfg. Co., 79 Or. 448, 155 P. 703, 705.
"Deliberation" and "premeditation" are of the same char-
acter of mental operations, differing only in degree. De-
liberation is but prolonged premeditation. In othe'- words,
in law, deliberation is premeditation in a cool state of the
blood, or, where there has been heat of passion, it is pre-
meditation continued beyond the period within which there
has been time for the blood to cool, in the given case. De-
liberation is not only to think of beforehand, which may
be but for an instant, but the inclination to do the act is
considered, weighed, pondered upon, for such a length of
time after a provocation is given as the jury may find was
sufficient for the blood to cool. One in a heat of passion
only exercised in a cool state of the blood, while premedita-
tion may be either in that state of the blood or in the heat
of passion. State v. Hall, 40 N.M. 128, 55 P.2d 740, 742;
People v. Thomas, 25 Ca1.2d 880, 156 P.2d 7, 17; State v.
Payne, 213 N. C. 719, 197 S.E. 573, 579.

## DELIBERATELY

Willfully; with premeditation;
intentionally; purposely; in cold blood. Aver-
heart v. State, 158 Ark. 639, 238 S.W. 620, 621;
State v. Young, 314 Mo. 612, 286 S.W. 29, 34;
Csanyi v. Csanyi, 93 N.J.Eq. 11, 115 A. 76, 78;

ing. The act of weighing and examining the rea-
sons for and against a contemplated act or course
of conduct or a choice of acts or means. See De-
liberate.

meats, relishes, preserves and the like. North
Ave. Market v. Keys, 164 Md. 185, 164 A. 152, 154.
Also, a store that sells such prepared foods. Park-
er v. Levin, 285 Mass. 125, 188 N.E. 502, 503, 90 A.
L.R. 1446.
Delicatus debitor est odiosus in lege. A luxuri-
ous debtor is odious in law. 2 Bulst. 148. Impris-
onment for debt has now, however, been generally
abolished.

## DELICT

In the Roman and civil law. A wrong
or injury; an offense; a violation of public or
private duty.
It will be observed that this word, taken in its most gen-
eral sense, is wider in both directions than our English
term "tort." On the one hand, it includes those wrongful
acts which, while directly affecting some individual or his
property, yet extend in their injurious consequences to the
peace or security of the community at large, and hence rise
to the grade of crimes or misdemeanors. These acts were
termed in the Roman law "public delicts;" while those
for which the only penalty exacted was compensation to
the person primarily injured were denominated "private
delicts." On the other hand, the term appears to have
included injurious actions which transpired without any
malicious intention on the part of the doer. Thus Pothier
gives the name "quasi delicts" to the acts of a person who,
without malignity, but by an inexcusable imprudence,
causes an injury to another. Poth.Obl. 116. But the term
is used in modern jurisprudence as a convenient synonym
of "tort."
Quasi Delict
An act whereby a person, without malice, but by fault,
negligence, or imprudence not legally excusable, causes
injury to another. They were four in number, viz.: (1)
Qui judex Went suam fecit, being the offense of partiality
or excess in the judex, (juryman.) (2) Dejecturn effusumve
aliquid, being the tort committed by one's servant in
emptying or throwing something out of an attic or upper
story upon a person passing beneath. (3) Darnnurn infec-
turn, being the offense of hanging dangerous articles over
the heads of persons passing along the king's highway.
(4) Torts committed by one's agents in the course of
their employment. Brown.

## DELICTUAL FAULT

An act, productive of ob-
ligations, which takes place between persons jurid-
ically strangers to each other; it supposes the
absence of obligation and its result is the creation
of one. Reserve Ins. Co. v. Fabre, 149 So.2d 413,
416, 243 La. 982.

## DELICTUM

Lat. A delict, tort, wrong, injury,
or offense. Actions ex delicto are such as are
on contract.
Culpability, blameworthiness, or legal delin-
quency. The word occurs in this sense in the
maxim, "In pari delicto melior est conditio de-
fendentis" (which see).
A challenge of a juror propter delictum is for
some crime or misdemeanor that affects his credit
and renders him infamous. 3 Bl.Comm. 363; 2
Kent, Comm. 241.

## DELIMIT

To mark or lay out the limits or
boundary line of a territory or country; to fix or
to mark the limits of; to demarcate; bound.
Walling v. Yeakley, C.C.A.Colo., 140 F.2d 830, 832.

territory, country, authority, right, statutory ex-

## DELINQUENT

linquent tax. Chauncey v. Wass, 35 Minn. 1, 30
N.W. 826; Gallup v. Schmidt, 154 Ind. 196, 56 N.
E. 450. As applied to a person, it commonly

is not necessarily a delinquent child. In re San-
tillanes, 47 N.M. 140, 138 P.2d 503, 513.

## DELIRIUM

In medical jurisprudence. Delirium
is that state of the mind in which it acts without
being directed by the power of volition, which is
wholly or partially suspended. This happens most
perfectly in dreams. But what is commonly call-
ed "delirium" is always preceded or attended by a
feverish and highly diseased state of the body.
The patient in delirium is wholly unconscious of
surrounding objects, or conceives them to be dif-
ferent from what they really are. His thoughts
seem to drift about, wildering and tossing amidst
distracted dreams. And his observations, when
he makes any, as often happens, are wild and in-
coherent; or, from excess of pain, he sinks into a
low muttering, or silent and death-like stupor.
The law contemplates this species of mental de-
rangement as an intellectual eclipse; as a dark-
ness occasioned by a cloud of disease passing over
the mind; and which must soon terminate in
health or in death. Supreme Lodge v. Lapp, 25
Ky.Law Rep. 74, 74 S.W. 656; Sommerville v.
Greenhood, 65 Mont. 101, 210 P. 1048, 1054; Grand
Lodge, A. 0. U. W. of Arkansas, v. Mode, 157 Ark.

## DELIRIUM FEBRILE

In medical jurisprudence.
A form of mental aberration incident to fevers,
and sometimes to the last stages of chronic dis-
eases.

## DELIRIUM TREMENS

A disorder of the ner-
vous system, involving the brain and setting up
an attack of temporary delusional insanity, some-
times attended with violent excitement or mania,
caused by excessive and long continued indulgence
in alcoholic liquors, or by the abrupt cessation of
such use after a protracted debauch. Horn v.
Commonwealth, 292 Ky. 587, 167 S.W.2d 58, 61;
Hartin v. Hysee Inghram Tire Co., 153 Pa.Super.
121, 33 A.2d 471, 473. See Insanity.

livered to him, on giving the same security as be-
fore. 3 Bl.Comm. 150; 3 Steph.Comm. 668.

## DELIVERY

stance thereof is placed within the actual or con-
structive possession or control of another. Poor

the intent of the parties. It is not necessary that
delivery should be by manual transfer. Miller v.
Hospelhorn, 176 Md. 356, 4 A.2d 728, 733.
"Delivery" required in conveyance of personal qhattels
as against all but vendor, is delivery in its natural sense ;
that is, a change of possession. Goodhue v. State St. Trust
Co., 267 Mass. 28, 165 N.E. 701, 705.
In General
The transfer from one person to another of the
res or a right or interest therein, which means
more than physical transfer of possession, Mur-
phy v. Smith, 291 Mass. 93, 195 N.E. 912; Pure
Oil Co. v. Evans, 369 Ill. 416, 17 N.E.2d 23, 24.
Although in the popular sense, in the case of a
contract or lease or the like, it implies a trans-
fer of the tangible contract. Lease, Roberts v.
Cyr, 136 Me. 39, 1 A.2d 281, 282; release for in-
jury, Pevesdorf v. Union Electric Light & Power

passbook, Brooks v. Mitchell, 163 Md. 1, 161 A.
261, 266, 84 A.L.R. 547.

the actual transfer of the instrument from the
possession of the grantor. Dyer v. Skadan, 128
Mich. 348, 87 N.W. 277, 278, 92 Am.St.Rep. 461. A
conditional delivery is one which passes the thing
subject to delivery from the possession of the
grantor, but is not to be completed by possession
of the grantee, or a third person as his agent, un-
til the happening of a specified event. Silliman v.
Dobner, 165 Minn. 87, 205 N.W. 696, 697.
Actual and constructive. Actual delivery consists
in the giving real possession to the vendee or his
servants or special agents who are identified with
him in law and represent him. Carr v. St. Louis-
San Francisco Ry. Co., Mo.App., 284 S.W. 184, 185.
It is a formal immediate tradition of the prop-
erty to the vendee. Bridgham v. Hinds, 120 Me.

plates a manual transfer of the property. Callan
v. Mutual Life Ins. Co., La.App., 147 So. 110, 111.
Constructive delivery is a general term, compre-
hending all those acts which, although not truly
conferring a real possession of the thing sold on
the vendee, have been held, by construction of law,
equivalent to acts of real delivery.
Constructive delivery includes symbolic or substituted
delivery and all those traditiones fictce which have been
admitted into the law as sufficient to vest the absolute
property in the vendee and bar the rights of lien and stop-
page in transitu, such as marking and setting apart the
goods as belonging to the vendee, charging him with ware-
house rent, etc. See In re Nesto, C.C.A.Pa., 270 F. 503.
A constructive delivery of personalty takes place when the
goods are set apart and notice given to the person to whom
they are to be delivered. The Titania, C.C.A., 131 F. 229,
65 C.C.A. 215, or when, without actual transfer of the goods
or their symbol, the conduct of the parties is such as to be
inconsistent with any other supposition than that there has
been a change In the nature of the holding. Swafford v.
Spratt, 93 Mo.App. 631, 67 S.W. 701.
Delivery bond. A bond given upon the seizure of
goods (as under the revenue laws) conditioned for
their restoration to the defendant, or the payment
of their value, if so adjudged.
Delivery order. An order addressed, in England,

Failure to make delivery, see Failure to Make
Delivery.

493, Ann.Cas.1917E, 427.
Symbolical delivery. The constructive delivery of
the subject-matter of a sale, where it is cumber-
some or inaccessible, by the actual delivery of
some article which is conventionally accepted as
the symbol or representative of it, or which ren-
ders access to it possible, or which is the evidence
of the purchaser's title to it; as the key of a
warehouse, or a bill of lading of goods on ship-
board. Hall v. Kansas City Terra Cotta Co., 97
Kan. 103, 154 P. 210, 212, L.R.A.1916D, 361, Ann.
Cas.1918D, 605.

## DELUSION

In medical jurisprudence. An in-
sane delusion is an unreasoning and incorrigible
belief in the existence of facts which are either
impossible absolutely, or, at least, impossible un-
der the circumstances of the individual. It is
never the result of reasoning and reflection; it is
not generated by them, and it cannot be dispelled
by them; and hence it is not to be confounded
with an opinion, however fantastic .the latter may
be. Guiteau's Case, D.C.D.C., 10 Fed. 161, 170;
Davidson v. Piper, 221 Iowa 171, 265 N.W. 107, 109;

capacity, In re McDowell's Estate, 103 N.J.Eq. 346,
143 A. 325, 326.
Systematized Delusion
One based on a false premise, pursued by a
logical process of reasoning to an insane conclu-
sion; there being one central delusion around
which other aberrations of the mind converge;
Taylor v. McClintock, 87 Ark. 243, 112 S.W. 405.

In the language of pleading, own; proper; or-
iginal. Thus, son assault demesne, his own as-
sault, his assault originally or in the first place.
Ancient Demesne
See Ancient.
Demesne as of Fee
A man is said to be seised in his demesne as of
fee of a corporeal inheritance, because he has a
property, dominicum or demesne, in the thing
itself. But when he has no dominion in the thing
itself, as in the case of an incorporeal heredita-
ment, he is said to be seised as of fee, and not in
his demesne as of fee. 2 Bl. Comm. 106; Little-
ton, § 10; Barnet v. Ihrie, 17 Serg. & R. (Pa.)
Demesne Lands
In English law. Those lands of a manor not
granted out in tenancy, but reserved by the lord
for his own uSe and occupation. Lands set apart
and appropriated by the lord for his own private
use, as for the supply of his table, and the main-
tenance of his family; the opposite of tenemental
lands. Tenancy and demesne, however, were not
in every sense the opposites of each other; lands
held for years or at will being included among
demesne lands, as well as those in the lord's ac-
tual possession. Spelman; 2 Bl. Comm. 90.
Demesne Lands of the Crown
That share of lands reserved to the crown at
the original distribution of landed property, or
which came to it afterwards by forfeiture or

create an estate for years or life; to lease. The
usual and operative word in leases: "Have grant-
ed, demised, and to farm let, and by these pres-
ents do grant, demise, and to farm let." 2 Bl.
Comm. 317; 1 Steph. Comm. 476; Co. Litt. 45a;
Carr v. King, 24 Cal.App. 713, 142 P. 131, 133.

## DEMISE

In conveyancing. A conveyance of
an estate to another for life, for years, or at will;
most commonly for years; a lease. 1 Steph.
Comm. 475. Priddy v. Green, Tex.Civ.App., 220
S.W. 243, 248. Originally a posthumous grant;
commonly a lease or conveyance for a term of
years; sometimes applied to any conveyance, in
fee, for life, or for years. Pub. St. Mass. 1882, p.
"Demise" is synonymous with "lease" or "let." The use
of the term in a lease imports a covenant for quiet enjoy-
ment. Evans v. Williams, 291 Ky. 484, 165 S.W.2d 52, 55;
Sixty-Third & Halsted Realty Co. v. Chicago City Bank &
Trust Co., 299 III.App. 297, 20 N.E.2d 162, 167; and implies
a covenant by lessor of good right and title to make the
lease. Evans v. Williams, 291 Ky. 484, 165 S.W.2d 52, 55.
A charter of a barge without motive power ac-
companied by bargee paid by owner, The Nat. E.
Sutton, D.C.N.Y., 42 F.2d 229, 232; Harbor Tow-
boat Co. v. Lowe, D.C.N.Y., 47 F.Supp. 454, 456;
or of a tug or other vessel under circumstances
making charterer owner pro hac vice, Davison
N.Y., 51 F.Supp. 380, 382; Conners Marine Co. v.
Wathen, D.C.N.Y., 43 F.Supp. 283, 284. Under a
demise charter, there is but a hiring of the vessel,
under which no title passes to the charterer but
merely the right to possess and control it for a
limited period. McGahern v. Koppers Coal Co.,
C.C.A.Pa., 108 F.2d 652, 653.
The word is also used as a synonym for "de-
cease" or "death." In England it is especially
employed to denote the death of the sovereign.
—Demise and redemise. In conveyancing. Mu-
tual leases made from one party to another on
each side, of the same land, or something out of
it; as when A. grants a lease to B. at a nominal
rent (as of a pepper corn), and B. redemises the
same property to A. for a shorter time at a real,
substantial rent. Jacob; Whishaw.
—Demise of the crown. The natural dissolution
of the king is generally so called; an expression
which signifies merely a transfer of property.
By demise of the crown we mean only that, in
consequence of the disunion of the king's natural
body from his body politic, the kingdom is trans-
ferred or demised to his successor, and so the
royal dignity remains perpetual. 1 Bl. Comm.
249; Plowd. 234.
—Several demises. In English practice. In the
action of ejectment, it was formerly customary,
in case there were any doubt as to the legal es-
tate being in the plaintiff, to insert in the declara-
tion several demises from as many different per-
sons; but this was rendered unnecessary by the
provisions of the common-law procedure acts.
—Single demise. A declaration in ejectment
might contain either one demise or several. When
it contained only one, it was called a "declaration
with a single demise."
DEMISI. Lat. I have demised or leased. Demisi,
concessi, et ad firmam tradidi; have demised,
granted, and to farm let. The usual operative
words in ancient leases, as the corresponding Eng-
lish words are in the modern forms. 2 Bl. Comm.
317, 318; Koch v. Hustis, 113 Wis. 599, 87 N.W.

## DEMISSIO

L. Lat. A demise or letting. Chief-
ly used in the phrase ex demissione (on the de-
mise), which formed part of the title of the cause
in the old actions of ejectment, where it signified
that the nominal plaintiff (a fictitious person)
held the estate "on the demise" of, that is, by
a lease from, the real plaintiff.

## DEMOBILIZATION

In military law. The dis-
missal of an army or body of troops from active
service.

## DEMOCRACY

That form of government in
which the sovereign power resides in and is ex-
ercised by the whole body of free citizens, as dis-
tinguished from a monarchy, aristocracy, or oli-
garchy. According to the theory of a pure de-
mocracy, every citizen should participate directly
the ultimate lodgment of the sovereignty being
the distinguishing feature, the introduction of the
representative system does not remove a govern-
ment from this type. However, a government of
the latter kind is sometimes specifically described
as a "representative democracy."
Town form of government constitutes pure
democracy as distinguished from representative
government. Commonwealth v. Town of Hud-
son, 315 Mass. 335, 52 N.E.2d 566, 572.
Democracy is loosely used of governments in which the
sovereign powers are exercised by all the people or ,a
large number of them, or specifically, in modern use, of a
representative government where there is equality of rights
without hereditary or arbitrary differences in rank or
privilege; and is distinguished from aristocracy. * * *
In modern representative democracies, as the United States
and France, though the governing body, that is, the elec-
torate, is a minority of the total population, the principle
on which the government is based is popular sovereignty,
which distinguishes them from aristocracies. Webster's
New Int.Dict.

## DEMOCRATIC

Of or pertaining to democracy,
or to a political party called "democratic," par-
ticularly, in the United States, the Democratic
party, which succeeded the Anti-federalist, or Re-
publican, party.

## DEMOLISH

To throw or pull down; to raze;
to destroy the fabrication of; to pull to pieces;
hence to ruin; destroy. Star Mfg. Co. v. Quarr-
les, 172 Okl. 550, 46 P.2d 497, 498. To destroy
totally or to commence the work of total destruc-
tion with the purpose of completing the same. 50

move." Durrett v. Woods, 155 La. 533, 99 So. 430,
DEMONETIZATION. The disuse of a particular
metal for purposes of coinage. The withdrawal
of the value of a metal as money.

merits by operation. J. A. Fay & Egan Co. v.
Mims, 151 S.C. 484, 149 S.E. 246, 248.

## DEMONSTRATIO

tion does not harm.) 2 Bla. Comm. 382, n.; 2
P. Wms. 140; 1 Greenl. Ev. § 291; Wigr. Wills
208, 233.

## DEMONSTRATION

ing, petition, or the like, is said to be demurrable
when it does not state such facts as support the
claim, prayer, or defense put forward. 5, Ch. Div.

## DEMURRAGE

In maritime law. The sum
which is fixed by the contract of carriage, or
which is allowed, as remuneration to the owner
of a ship for the detention of his vessel beyond
the number of days allowed by the charter-party
for loading and unloading or for sailing. Also
the detention of the vessel by the freighter beyond
such time. See 3 Kent, Comm. 203; 2 Steph.
Comm. 185. Continental Grain Co. v. Armour
Fertilizer Works, D.C.N.Y. 22 F.Supp. 49, 54;
Yone Suzuki v. Central Argentine Ry., C.C.A.N.
Y., 27 F.2d 795, 804. The term has been adopted
in railroad practice. Central R. Co. of N. J. v.
Gallena-Poole, Inc., 107 N.J.Eq. 267, 152 A. 251,
252; Sibley, L. B. & S. Ry. Co. v. Braswell Sand
& Gravel Co., La.App., 199 So. 427, 428.
The sum agreed to be paid to the ship for delay caused
without her fault, and which ordinarily does not begin to

Div. 737; W. R. Grace & Co. v. Hansen, C.C.A.Wash., 273
F. 486, 496.
"Demurrage" is only an extended freight or reward to
the vessel, in compensation for the earnings she is improp-
erly caused to lose. Every improper detention of a vessel
may be considered a demurrage, and compensation under
that name be obtained for it. Donaldson v. McDowell,
Holmes, 290, Fed.Cas.No.3,985.
"Demurrage" is a claim for damages for failure of the
consignee to accept delivery of the goods. Little v. One
Cargo of Lumber, D.C.Fla., 2 F.2d 608, 609.

## DEMURRANT

One who demurs; the party
who, in pleading, interposes a demurrer.
In Equity
An allegation of a defendant, which, admitting
the matters of fact alleged by the bill to be true,
shows that as they are therein set forth they are
insufficient for the plaintiff to proceed upon or to
oblige the defendant to answer; or that, for some
reason apparent on the face of the bill, or on
account of the omission of some matter which
ought to be contained therein, or for want of
some circumstances which ought to be attendant
thereon, the defendant ought not to be compelled
to answer to the whole bill, or to some certain
part thereof. Mitf. Eq. Pl. 107. See, also, Gold-
smith v. Mead Johnson & Co., 176 Md. 682, 7 A.2d
176, 179.
A general demurrer in equity, as a separate entity from
a demurrer on specific grounds, tests the equity of a bill
in the same manner as a motion to dismiss for want of
equity, and, in considering the bill on such a demurrer,
amendable defects are taken as amended. Johnson v.
Pugh, 193 So. 317, 239 Ala. 12.
By Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, demurrers, pleas
and exceptions for insufficiency of a pleading are abolished;
every defence in law shall be made by motion or by
answer; motions going to jurisdiction, venue, process, or
failure to state a claim are to be disposed of before trial,
unless the court orders otherwise.
In Pleading
The formal mode of disputing the sufficiency in
law of the pleading of the other side. In effect it
is an allegation that, even if the facts as stated
in the pleading to which objection is taken be
true, yet their legal consequences are not such
as to put the demurring party to the necessity of
answering them or proceeding further with the
cause. Green v. Carter, 28 Ohio App. 492, 162 N.
E. 814, 815; State v. Broad River Power Co., 177
S.C. 240, 181 S.E. 41; Mountain Park Institute v.
Lovill, 198 N.C. 642, 153 S.E. 114, 116; State v.
California Packing Corporation, 105 Utah 191, 145
P.2d 784.
A "demurrer" is not an absolute admission of
any fact but simply admits those facts that are
well pleaded. Commonwealth ex rel. Duff v.
Keenan, 347 Pa. 574, 33 A.2d 244, 248.
An objection made by one party to his opponent's plead-
ing, alleging that he ought not to answer it, for some
defect in law in the pleading. It admits the facts, and
refers the law arising thereon to the court. R. L. Davies
& Co. v. Blomberg, 185 N.C. 496, 117 S.E. 497.
It imports that the objecting party will not proceed,' but
will wait the judgment of the court whether he is bound
so to do. Co.Litt. 71b; Steph.P1. 61; Kramer v. Barth,
139 N.Y.S. 341, 344, 79 Misc. 80.
Classification and Varieties
A general demurrer is a demurrer framed in
general terms, without showing specifically the
nature of the objection, and which is usually re-
sorted to where the objection is to matter of sub-
stance. Steph.Pl. 140-142; 1 Chit.Pl. 663. See
Maryland Casualty Co. v. Arnold, 51 Ga.App. 562,
180 S.E. 906, 907.
Thus, a demurrer on the ground that the complaint sets
forth no cause of action, is a general demurrer, Alabama
Power Co. v. Curry, 228 Ala. 444, 153 So. 634; and a motion
to dismiss a bill on ground that there is no equity apparent
on the face thereof or that court has no jurisdiction is
treated as a general demurrer. People v. Sterling, 357 Ill.
354, 192 N.E. 229, 231.
A general demurrer to an indictment challenges only
matters of form and substance appearing -on its face. It
is one which raises an objection that averments are insuf-
ficient in law to support the action or defense without
specifying any particular cause or defect, and is sufficient
only to reach matters of substance. Mountain Park Insti-
tute v. Lovill, 198 N. C. 642, 153 S.E. 114, 116.
A motion to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a
claim upon which relief can be granted is equivalent to a
general demurrer. Louisiana Farmers' Protective Union v.
Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. of America, D.C.Ark., 40
F.Supp. 897, 908.
A special demurrer goes merely to structure or
form of pleading which it attacks, and usually
only to some portion thereof, and must distinctly
specify wherein defect lies. Huff v. Palmer, 356
Ill. 563, 191 N.E. 199, 202; Cameron v. Evans
Securities Corp., 119 Cal.App. 164, 6 P.2d 272, 274;
It is one which excepts to the sufficiency of the
pleadings on the opposite side, and shows speci-
fically the nature of the objection, and the par-
ticular ground of the exception. 3 Bouv. Inst.
no. 3022. Dairy Regior Land Corporation v. Hard-
ing, Tex.Civ.App., 266 S.W. 181, 182; Johanson
v. Cudahy Packing Co., 107 Utah 114, 152 P.2d 98,
While general demurrer on specific grounds relating to
different allegations of bill may be called "special demur-
rer," which attacks different parts of bill specifically, such
demurrer fails, if bill is good as pleading and remaining
allegations are sufficient to support relief prayed. Forcum
v. Symmes, 106 Fla. 510, 143 So. 630, 631.
A speaking demurrer is one which, in order to
sustain itself, requires the aid of a fact not ap-
pearing on the face of the pleading objected to,
or, in other words, which alleges or assumes the
existence of a fact not already pleaded, and which
constitutes the ground of objection and is con-
demned both by the common law and the code
system of pleading. Ellis v. Perley, 200 N.C. 403,
157 S.E. 29, 30. Ferris v. Union Say. Bank, 45
Ga.App. 544, 165 S.E. 450; Preston A. Blair Co. v.
Rose, 56 Idaho 114, 51 P.2d 209, 212; Metropolitan
Life Ins. Co. v. Perrin, 184 Miss. 249, 183 So. 917,
920; Town of Randolph v. Lyon, 106 Vt. 495, 175
A. 1, 2; Whaley v. First Nat. Bank, 229 Ala. 153,
155 So. 574.
A speaking demurrer is one which alleges some
new matter, not disclosed by the pleading against
which the demurrer is aimed and not judicially
known or legally presumed to be true. Blythe
v. Enslen, 219 Ala. 638, 123 So. 71, 73; Kansas
Life Ins. Co. v. First Bank of Truscott, Tex.Civ.
App., 47 S.W.2d 675, 677; In re Ferris' Estate,
Iowa, 14 N.W.2d 889, 894.
A parol demurrer (not properly a demurrer at
all) was a staying of the pleadings; a suspension
of the proceedings in an action during the non-
age of an infant, especially in a real action. Now
abolished. 3 Bl. Comm. 300.
Demurrer book. In practice. A record of the
issue on a demurrer at law, containing a tran-
script of the pleadings, with proper entries; and
intended for the use of the court and counsel on
the argument. 3 Bl. Comm. 317; 3 Steph. Comm.
Demurrer ore tenus. An objection to the in-
troduction of any evidence on the ground that the
complaint or petition fails to state a cause of ac-
tion. Cleveland v. Bateman, 21 N.M. 675, 158 P.
648, 652, Ann.Cas.1918E, 1011; Peerless Fixture
Co. v. Frick, Mo.App., 133 S.W.2d 1089, 1090. This
name is sometimes given to a ruling on an ob-
jection to evidence, but is not properly a demurrer
at all. Mandelert v. Land Co., 104 Wis. 423, 80
N.W. 726; It should be considered as a general
demurrer only. Dawkins v. People's Bank &
Trust Co., 117 Okl. 181, 245 P. 594, 596.
Demurrer to evidence. This proceeding is an-
alogous to a demurrer to a pleading. It is an ob-
jection or exception by one of the parties in an ac-
tion at law, to the effect that the evidence which
his adversary produced is insufficient in point of
law (whether true or not) to make out his case
or sustain the issue. Upon joinder in demurrer,
the jury is discharged, and the case is argued to
the court in bane, who gives judgment upon the
facts as shown in evidence. See 3 Bl. Comm. 372;
State v. Moody, 150 N.C. 847, 64 S.E. 431, 432.
The practice has been largely superseded by mo-
tions for nonsuit and directed verdict. Hopkins
v. Nashville, C. & St. L. Ry., 96 Tenn. 409, 34 S.W.
1029, 1034, 32 L.R.A. 354. Thus, a motion to non-
suit, Herrick v. Barzee, 96 Or. 357, 190 P. 141, 145;
Perkins v. Maiden, 57 Cal.App.2d 46, 134 P.2d 30,
34, a motion to dismiss at close of plaintiff's evi-
dence for failure to prove essential facts, Mans-
field v. Reserve Oil Co., 38 N.M. 187, 29 P.2d 491,
492; Fewkes v. Borah, 376 Ill. 596, 35 N.E.2d 69,
72, have been held to be, and a defendant's motion
for a directed verdict, made at close of the evi-
dence, is equivalent to, a "demurrer to the evi-
dence" for insufficiency to sustain a verdict for
plaintiff. Mills v. Richardson, 126 Me. 244, 137
A. 689, 690. A motion to exclude evidence has the
effect of a demurrer to the evidence, the chief
points of difference being the stage of the pro-
ceeding at which each is available and the conse-
quences resulting from deferring the motion to
exclude. Thornhill v. Thornhill, 172 Va. 553, 2
S.E.2d 318, 319. For a discussion of the subject
see Hopkins v. Nashville, C. & St. L. R. R., 96
Tenn. 409, 34 S.W. 1029, 32 L.R.A. 354.
Demurrer to interrogatories. Where a witness
objects to a question propounded (particularly
on the taking of a deposition) and states his
reason for objecting or refusing to answer, it is
called a "demurrer to the interrogatory," though
the term cannot here be understood as used in its
technical sense. 2 Swanst. 194; Gresl. Eq. Ey,
61; 2 Atk. 524; 1 Y. & J. 132.

## DEMY SANKE, DEMY SANGUE

Half-blood.
A corruption of demi-sang.

## DEN

A valley. Blount. A hollow place among
woods. Cowell.

## DEN AND STROND

In old English law. Lib-
erty for ships or vessels to run aground, or come
ashore (strand themselves). Cowell.

## DENARIATE

In old English law. As much
land as is worth one penny per annum.

## DENARII

An ancient general term for any sort
of petunia numerata, or ready money. The
French use the word "denier" in the same sense,
-payer de ses propres deniers.

## DENARII DE CARITATE

In English law. Cus-
tomary oblations made to a cathedral church at
Pentecost.

## DENARII S

PETRI. (Commonly called "Peter's
Pence.") An annual payment on St. Peter's feast
of a penny from every family to the pope, during
the time that the Roman Catholic religion was
established in England.

## DENARIUS

The chief silver coin among the
Romans, worth 8d.; it was the seventh part of a
Roman ounce. Also an English penny. The den-
arius was first coined five years before the first
Punic war, B. C. 269. In later times a copper
coin was called "denarius." • Smith, Dict. Antiq.
DENARIUS DEL (Lat. "God's penny.") Earnest
money; money given as a token of the comple-
tion of a bargain. It differs from arrhce in this:
that arrhce is a part of the consideration, while
the denarius Dei is no part of it. The latter was
given away in charity; whence the name. 1 Du-
vergnoy, n. 132; 3 Duvergnoy, n. 49; Rupert. de
Jur., Denier a Dieu.

## DENARIUS TERTIUS COMITATUS

In old
English law. A third part or penny of the county
paid to its earl, the other two parts being reserved
to the crown.

## DENIAL

A traverse in the pleading of one party
of an allegation of fact set up by the other; a
defense. See Flack v. O'Brien, 43 N.Y.S. 854, 19
Misc. 399; Mott v. Baxter, 29 Colo. 418, 68 P. 220.
A deprivation, as the denial of a constitutional
right, U. S. v. Carolene Products Co., Ill., 58 S.Ct.
778, 783, 304 U.S. 144, 82 L.Ed. 1234, or a denial
of civil rights. State of New Jersey v. Weinberger,
D.C.N.J., 38 F.2d 298, 302. A refusal or re-
jection, as the denial of a claim on a war risk
policy by Veterans' Administration, U. S. v.
Green, C.C.A.Tenn., 84 F.2d 449, 450; Morris v.
U. S., C.C.A.Miss., 96 F.2d 731, 732, or of a claim
for workmen's compensation. Commercial Cas-
ualty Ins. Co. v. Hilton, Tex.Civ.App., 55 S.W.2d
120, or of probation. People v. Lopez, 43 Cal.
App.2d 854, 110 P.2d 140, 144. A disavowal. Peo-
ple v. Bell, 96 Cal.App. 503, 274 P. 393, 396; Mas-
sell v. Fourth Nat. Bank, 38 Ga.App. 601, 144 S.E.
806, 807.
General and Specific
In code pleading, a general denial is one which
puts in issue all the material averments of the
complaint or petition, and permits the defendant
to prove any and all facts tending to negative
those averments or any of them. Telford v. Iowa
Guarantee Mortg. Corp., 58 S.D. 261, 235 N.W. 663,
665. A specific denial is a separate denial applic-
able to one particular allegation of the complaint.
Gas Co. v. San Francisco, 9 Cal. 470; An answer
by way of a general denial is the equivalent of,
and substitute for, the general issue under the
common-law system of pleading. It gives to the
defendant the same right to require the plaintiff
to establish by proof all the material facts nec-
essary to show his right to a recovery as was
given by that plea. Kline v. Harris, 30 N.D. 421,
152 N.W. 687, 688, Ann.Cas.1917D, 1176.

## DENIER

L. Fr. In old English law. Denial;
refusal. Denier is when the rent (being demand-
ed upon the land) is not paid. Finch, Law, b. 3,
c. 5.

## DENIER A DIEU

In French law. Earnest mon-
ey; a sum of money given in token of the com-
pletion of a bargain. The phrase is a translation
of the Latin Denarius Dei, (q. v.).

## DENIZATION

The act of making one a den-
izen; the conferring of the privileges of citizen-
ship upon an alien born. Cro. Jac. 540. See Den-
izen.

## DENIZE

To make a man a denizen or citizen.

## DENIZEN

In English law. A person who, being
an alien born, has obtained, ex donatione regis,
letters patent to make him an English subject,—
a high and incommunicable branch of the royal
prerogative. A denizen is in a kind of middle
state between an alien and a natural-born sub-
ject, and partakes of the status of both of these.
1 Bl. Comm. 374; 7 Coke 6; Ex parte Gilroy, D.C.
N.Y., 257 F. 110, 128.
The term is used to signify a person who, being an alien
by birth, has obtained letters patent making him an Eng-
lish subject. The king may denize, but not naturalize, a
man; the latter requiring the consent of parliament, as
under the naturalization act, 1870, 33 & 34 Vict. c. 14. A
denizen holds a position midway between an alien and a
natural-born or naturalized subject, being able to take
lands by purchase or devise, (which an alien could not
until 1870 do,) but not able to take lands by descent,
(which a natural-born or naturalized subject may do.)
Brown.
The denizen becomes a British subject from the date of
the letters while a naturalized person is placed in a posi-
tion equivalent to that of a natural-born subject; Dicey,
Confl.Laws 164.
The word is also used in this sense in South Carolina.
See McClenaghan v. McClenaghan, 1 Strob.Eq., S.C., 319,
47 Am. Dec. 532.
In American law. A dweller; a stranger ad-
mitted to certain rights in a foreign country or
as one who lives habitually in a country but is
not a native born citizen; one holding a middle
state between an alien and a natural born sub-
ject. United States ex rel. Zdunic v. Uhl, D.C.
N.Y., 46 F.Supp. 688, 691. One who has some
relation to the enemy nation which is not lost by
the alien's presence within the United States.
United States ex rel. Zdunic v. Uhl, C.C.A.N.Y.,
137 F.2d 858, 861; United States ex rel. D'Esquiva
v. Uhl, C.C.A.N.Y., 137 F.2d 903, 905.
Thus, one who lived and worked in Austria in 1938 at
time Germany obtained control of Austrian government,
and continued to live there until leaving for the United
States in 1939, at which time he was issued a German pass-
port, was a "denizen" of Germany, within Enemy Alien
Act. United States ex rel. Zdunic v. Uhl, D.C.N.Y., 47
F.Supp. 520.
A denizen, in the primary, but obsolete, sense
of the word, is a natural-born subject of a coun-
try. Co. Litt. 129a; Levy v. McCartee, 6 Pet. 102,
116, 8 L.Ed. 334.

## DENMAN'S (LORD) ACT

An English statute,
for the amendment of the law of evidence, (6 & 7
Vict. c. 85,) which provides that no person offered
as a witness shall thereafter be excluded by

## DENOUNCE

To declare (an act or thing) to
be a crime arid prescribe a punishment for it.
State v. De Hart, 109 La. 570, 33 So. 605. The

as the equivalent of "accuse" or "inform against."
The term is frequently used in regard to treat-
ies, indicating the act of one nation in giving no-
tice to another nation of its intention to terminate
an existing treaty between the two nations. The
French dënoncer means to declare, to lodge an
information against. Bellows, Fr. Diet,
DENOUNCEMENT.
In Mexican Mining Law
Denouncement is an application to the author-
ities for a grant of the right to work a mine,
either on the ground of new discovery, or on the
ground of forfeiture of the rights of a former
owner, through abandonment or contravention of
the mining law. Cent. Dict. See Castillero v. U.
S., 2 Black, 109, 17 L.Ed. 360; Stewart v. King, 85
Or. 14, 166 P. 55, 56.
A "denouncement" is an application for the acquisition
of land for mining purposes, under certain rules prescribed
by Mexican laws. The application is called the "denounce-
ment," and, when approved by the Mexican government,
is called "concession" or "title," sometimes "patent." It
is then a grant given by the government to use the land
applied for, for the purpose of mining, and is *called the
"title." Winningham v. Dyo, Tex.Com.App., 48 S.W.2d
600, 603.
In Spanish and Mexican Law
A judicial proceeding for the forfeiture of land
held by an alien.
Though real property might be acquired by an alien in
fraud of the law,—that is, without observing its require-
ments,—he nevertheless retained his right and title to it,
but was liable to be deprived of it by the proper proceed-
ing of denouncement, which in its substantive character-
istics was equivalent to the inquest of office found, at com-
mon law. De Merle v. Mathews, 26 Cal. 477.
The "denouncement of a new work" is a pro-
ceeding to obtain an order of court, in the nature
of an injunction, against the construction of a
new building or other work, which, if completed,
would injuriously affect the plaintiff's property.
Von Schmidt v. Huntington, 1 Cal. 55.

Stern, C.C.A.Minn., 110 F.2d 601, 603. To depart,
as from the state, is not necessarily synonymous
with the phrase "leave the state," or the phrase
"absent from the state." Williams v. Williams, 57
Cal.App. 36, 206 P. 650, 652; Aronow v. Bishop,
112 Mont. 611, 120 P.2d 423, 424.
In Maritime Law
To leave a port; to be out of a port. To depart
imports more than to sail, or set sail. A warranty
in a policy that a vessel shall depart on or before
a particular day is a warranty not only that she
shall sail, but that she shall be out of the port
on or before that day. 3 Maule & S. 461; 3 Kent
Comm. 307, note. "To depart" does not mean
merely to break ground, but fairly to set forward
upon the voyage. Moir v. Assur. Co., 6 Taunt. 241;
Young v. The Orpheus, 119 Mass. 185; The Helen
Brown (D.C.) 28 F. 111.

a former pleading, and assume a new one. See

## DEPARTMENT

One of the territorial divisions
of a country. The term is chiefly used in this
sense in France, where the division of the country
into departments is somewhat analogous, both ter-
ritorially and for governmental purposes, to the
division of an American state into counties. The
United States have been divided into military de-
partments, including certain portions of the coun-
try. Parker v. U. S., 1 Pet. 293, 7 L.Ed. 150.
Generally, a branch or division of governmental
administration. Glendinning v. Curry, 153 Fla.
398, 14 So.2d 794, 802.
One of the divisions of the executive branch of
government. Used in this sense in the United
States, where each department is charged with
a specific class of duties, and comprises an or-
ganized staff of officials; e. g., the department of
state, department of war, etc.
With reference to state or municipal administration, a
"bureau" is merely a division of a department. In re
McLaughlin, 210 N.Y.S. 68, 72, 124 Misc. 766.
Also, a division of a business, or of something
comparable thereto. See State v. Arkansas Lum-
ber Co., 126 Ark. 107, 189 S.W. 671; U. S. v. Elgin,
J'. & E. Ry. Co., Ill., 56 S.Ct. 841, 298 U.S. 492, 80
L.Ed. 1300.

## DEPARTMENT STORE

Generally, a store in
which a variety of merchandise is arranged in or
offered for sale from several departments or sec-
tions, but the term cannot be applied with any cer-
tainty to a particular business and is too indefinite
to be used as a classification for the purpose of
taxation. Barker Bros. v. City of Los Angeles,
10 Cal.2d 603, 76 P.2d 97.

## DEPARTURE

A deviation or divergence, from
a standard rule or measurement. Hamilton Mfg.
Co. v. Tubbs Mfg. Co., D.C.Mich., 216 F. 401, 409.
From a permitted use of vehicle or route, Reddy-
Waldhauer-Maffett Co. v. Spivey, 53 Ga.App. 117,
185 S.E. 147, 148. Jeffries v. Jodawelky, 304 Mich.
421, 8 N.W.2d 121, 122. From employment or
work, United Employers Casualty Co. v. Barker,
Tex.Civ.App., 148 S.W.2d 260, 263; Hartford Ac-
cident & Indemnity Co. v. Cardillo, 112 F.2d 11, 15,
72 App.D.C. 52.
A variance between pleading and proof. Kint-
ner v. U. S., C.C.A.Colo., 71 F.2d 961, 962.
In Maritime Law
A deviation from the course prescribed in the
policy of insurance.
In Pleading
The statement of matter in a replication, rejoin-
der, or subsequent pleading, as a cause of action or
defense, which is not pursuant to the previous
pleading of the same party, and which does not
support and fortify it. 2 Williams, Saund. 84a,
note 1; 2 Wils. 98; Co.Litt. 304a; Hanna v. Royce,
119 Or. 450, 249 P. 173, 175.
A departure occurs when party departs from cause or
defense first made and has recourse to another. Living-
ston v. Malever, 103 Fla. 200, 137 So. 113, 118; Clonts v.
State, 19 Ala.App. 130, 95 So. 562; Northwestern Nat. Life
Ins. Co. v. Ward, 56 Okl. 188, 155 P. 524, 525; Burrell v.
Masters, 65 Colo. 310, 176 P. 316, 317. Or, in other words,
when the second pleading contains matter not pursuant to
the former, and which does not support and fortify It.
Hence a departure obviously can never take place till the
replication. Steph.Pl. 410. Each subsequent pleading must
pursue or support the former one; i. e., the replication
must support the declaration, and the rejoinder the plea,
without departing out of it. 3 Bl.Comm. 310. An amend-
ment to a petition changing the cause of action is not,
technically, a "departure." King v. Milner, 63 Colo. 407,
167 P. 957, 960; MacGerry v. Rodgers, 144 Wash. 375, 258
P. 314, 315.

## DEPARTURE IN DESPITE OF COURT

In old
English practice. The tenant in a real action,
having once appeared, was considered as con-
structively present in court until again called
upon. Hence if, upon being demanded, he failed
to appear, he was said to have "departed in despite
[i. e., contempt] of the court." Co.Litt. 139a; 8
Co. 62a; 1 Rolle, Abr. 583; Metc.Yelv. 211.

141 S.W.2d 73, 79.

## DEPENDENCY

A territory distinct from the
country in which the supreme sovereign power
resides, but belonging rightfully to it, and subject
to the laws and regulations which the sovereign
may think proper to prescribe. U. S'. v. The Nan-
cy, 3 Wash.C.C. 286, Fed.Cas.No.15,854; Posadas
v. National City Bank of N. Y., Phil.Islands,
56 S.Ct. 349, 350, 296 U.S. 497, 80 L.Ed. 351.
It differs from a colony, because it is not set-
tled by the citizens of the sovereign or mother
state; and from possession, because it is held by
other title than that of mere conquest.
A relation between two persons, where one is
sustained by another or looks to or relies on aid
of another for support or for reasonable neces-
saries consistent with dependent's position in life.
Peterson v. Industrial Commission, 331 Ill. 254, 162
N.E. 846, 847.

another; Milkovich v. Industrial Comm., 91 Utah,
498, 64 P.2d 1290, 1293; Texas Employers Ins.
Ass'n v. Arnold, Tex.Civ.App., 62 S.W.2d 609, 611;
not merely persons who derive a benefit from the
earnings of the deceased; [1899] 1 Q.B. 1005;
Havey v. Erie R. Co., 88 N.J.Law, 684, 96 A. 995,

other, or who relies on another for support or
favor. King v. Illinois Steel Corporation, 92 Ind.
App. 456, 176 N.E. 161, 162.
DEPENDENT, adj. Deriving existence, support,
or direction from another; conditioned, in respect
to force or obligation, upon an extraneous act or
fact.
Under a statute relating to dependent children, "depend-
ent" is synonymous with "neglected," but not with "delin-
quent." People v. Ellis, 185 Ill.App. 417, 420; Durres v.
Deckard, 105 Ind.App. 674, 17 N.E.2d 481, 484.
Under a California juvenile act, a "dependent person" is
one under the age of 21 years who is in danger of growing
up to lead an idle, dissolute, or immoral life. People v.
Cruse, 24 Cal.App. 497, 141 P. 936.

Dependent covenant. See Covenant.
Dependent promise. One which it is not the
duty of the promisor to perform until some ob-
ligation contained in the same agreement has been
performed by the other party. Hamm.Partn. 17,
29, 30, 109; Harr.Const. 152.

## DEPENDENT RELATIVE REVOCATION

The
doctrine which regards as mutually dependent the
acts of one destroying a will and thereupon sub-
stituting another instrument for distribution of es-
tate, when both acts are result of one plan, so that,
if second act, through incompleteness or other de-
fect, fails to accomplish its intended purpose, and
it thereby becomes evident that testator was misled
when he destroyed his will, act of destruction is
regarded as bereft of intent of revocation and way
for probate of destroyed will is opened. Flanders
v. White, 142 Or. 375, 18 P.2d 823, 827; In re
Nelson's Estate, 183 Minn. 295, 236 N.W. 459,

## DEPONE

In Scotch practice. To depose; to
make oath in writing.

## DEPONENT

In practice. One who deposes (that
is, testifies or makes oath, now in writing) to the
truth of certain facts; one who gives under oath
testimony which is reduced to writing; one who
makes oath to a written statement. The party
making an affidavit is generally so called, though
in the United States the term "affiant" is also
commonly applied to such party, the terms, when
used with reference to one making an affidavit,
are synonymous. Walden v. Crego's Estate, 238
Mich. 564, 285 N.W. 457, 461.
The word "depone," from which is derived "deponent,"
has relation to the mode in which the oath is administered,
(by the witness placing his hand upon the book of the
holy evangelists,) and not as to whether the testimony is
delivered orally or reduced to writing. "Deponent" is
included in the term "witness," but "witness" is more
general. Bliss v. Shuman, 47 Me. 248.

## DEPONER

In old Scotch practice. A deponent.
3 How. State Tr. 695.

## DEPOPULATIO AGRORUM

In old English law.

waste a country. 2 Hale, P. C. 333; 4 Bl.Comm.

## DEPOPULATION

## DEPORTATIO

Lat. In the civil law. A kind
of banishment, where a condemned person was
sent or carried away to some foreign country,
usually to an island, (in insulam deportatur,) and
thus taken out of the number of Roman citizens,
DEPORTATION. Banishment to a foreign coun-
try, attended with confiscation of property and
deprivation of civil rights. A punishment derived
from the deportatio (q. v.) of the Roman law, and
still in use in France.
In American Law
The removal or sending back of an alien to the
country from which he came, the removal from
the country of an alien considered inimical to pub-
lic welfare; the removal of an alien out of the
country simply because his presence is deemed
inconsistent with the public welfare, and without
any punishment being imposed or contemplated.
Yonejiro Nakasuji v. Seager, D.C.Cal., 3 F.Supp.
410, 413.
"The removal of an alien out of the country, simply
because his presence is deemed inconsistent with the pub-
lic welfare, and without any punishment being imposed or
contemplated, either under the laws of the country out of
which he is sent, or under those of the country to which
he is. taken." It differs from transportation, which is by
way of punishment of one convicted of an offence against
the laws of the country; and from extradition (q. v.),
which is the surrender to another country of one accused
of an offence against its laws, there to be tried, and, if
found guilty, punished. Fong Yue Ting v. U. S., 149 U.S.
698, 13 S.Ct. 1016, 37 L. Ed. 905.
"Deportation," as distinguished from "exclusion," is
depriving a person already in the United States of a privi-
lege which he, at least at the time, is enjoying ; whereas
"exclusion" is the denial of entry, and does not deprive
one of any liberties he had theretofore enjoyed. Ex parte
Domingo Corypus, D.C., 6 F.2d 336.
In Roman Law
A perpetual banishment, depriving the banished
of his rights as a citizen; it differed from relega-
tion (q. v.) and exile, (q. v.) 1 Brown, Civil &
Adm. Law, 125, note; Inst. 1, 12, 1, and 2; Dig.
48, 22, 14, 1,

## DEPOSE

shape of a deposition; to make statements which
are written down and sworn to; to give testimony
which is reduced to writing by a duly-qualified
officer and sworn to by the deponent. To say (in

erty of another, binding himself to preserve it and return
it in kind. Henry Rose Mercantile & Mfg. Co. v. Stearns,

or security for the performance of some contract,
to be forfeited if the depositor fails in his under-
taking. It may be deemed to be part payment,
and to that extent may constitute the purchaser
the actual owner of the estate. Larson v. Metcalf,
201 Iowa, 1208, 207 N.W. 382, 384, 45 A.L.R. 344.
Classification
According to the classification of the civil law, deposits
are of the following several sorts : (1) Necessary, made
upon some sudden emergency, and from some pressing
necessity; as, for instance, in case of a fire, a shipwreck,
or other overwhelming calamity, when property is con-
fided to any person whom the depositor may meet without
proper opportunity for reflection or choice, and thence it
is called "miserabile depositum." (2) Voluntary, which
arises from the mere consent and agreement of the parties.
Dig. 16, 3, 2; Story, Bailm. § 44. The common law has
made no such division.
There is another class of deposits called "involuntary,"
which may be without the assent or even knowledge of
the depositor ; as lumber, etc., left upon another's land by
the subsidence of a flood. An "involuntary" deposit is one
made by the accidental leaving or placing of personal prop-
erty in the possession of any person without negligence on
the part of the owner. Copelin v. Berlin Dyeworks
Laundry Co., 168 Cal. 715, 144 P. 961, 963, L.R.A.1915C,
The civilians again divide deposits into "simple depos-
its," made by one or more persons having a common inter-
est, . and "sequestrations'," made by one or more persons,
each of whom has a different and adverse interest in con-
troversy touching it; and these last are of two sorts,-
"conventional," or such as are made by the mere agree-
ment of the parties without any judicial act; and "judi-
cial," or such as are made by order of a court in the
course of some proceeding. Thus, under Louisiana stat-
utes, it is said that the difference between "sequestration"
and "deposit" is that the former may have for its object
both movable and immovable property, while the latter is
confined to movables. Raines v. Dunson, 145 La. 1011, 83
So. 224, 226.
There is another class of deposits called "irregular," as
when a person, having a sum of money which he does not
think safe in his own hands, confides it to another, who is
to return to him, not the same money, but a like sum when
he shall demand it. Poth. du Depot. 82, 83; Story, Bailm.
§ 84. A regular deposit is a strict or special' deposit; a
deposit which must be returned in specie; e., the thing
deposited must be returned. A quasi deposit is a kind of
implied or involuntary deposit, which takes place where a
party comes lawfully to the possession of another person's
property, by finding it. Story, Bailm. § 85. Particularly
with reference to money, deposits are also classed as gen-
eral or spacial. A general deposit is where the money
deposited is not itself to be returned, but an equivalent in
money (that is, a like sum) is to be returned. It is equiva-
lent to a loan, and the money deposited becomes the prop-
erty of the depositary. City of Canby v. Bank of Canby,
192 Minn. 571, 257 N.W. 520.
A special deposit is a deposit in which the identical thing
deposited is to be returned to the depositor. The par-
ticular object of this kind of deposit is safekeeping. Koet-
ting v. State, 88 Wis. 502, 60 N.W. 822. Marine Bank v.
Fulton Bank, 69 U.S. 252, 2 Wall. 252, 17 L.Ed. 785. In
banking law, this kind of deposit is contrasted with a
"general" deposit, as above; but in the civil law it is the
antithesis of an "irregular" deposit. A gratuitous or naked
deposit is a bailment of goods to be kept for the depositor
without hire or reward on either side, or one for which
the depositary receives no consideration beyond the mere
possession of the thing deposited. Properly and originally,
all deposits are of this description; for according to the Ro-
man law, a bailment of goods for which hire or a price is
to be paid, is not called "depositum" but "locatio." If
the owner of the property pays for its custody or care, it
is a "locatio custodies;" if, on the other hand, the bailee
pays for the use of it, it is "locatio rei." (See Locatio.)
But in the modern law of those states which have been In-
fluenced by the Roman jurisprudence, a gratuitous or nak-
ed deposit is distinguished from a "deposit for hire," in
which the bailee is to be paid for his services in keeping
the article. There is also a specific deposit, which exists
where money or property is given to a bank for some
specific and particular purpose, as a note for collection,
money to pay a particular note, or property for some
other specific purpose. Officer v. Officer, 120 Iowa 389, 94
N.W. 947, 98 Am. St. 365.
In Banking Law
The act of placing or lodging money in the cus-
tody of a bank or banker, for safety or conven-
ience, to be withdrawn at the will of the depositor
or under rules and regulations agreed on. Also,
the money so deposited, or the credit which the
depositor receives for it. State Banking Board v.
James, Tex.Civ.App., 264 S.W. 145, 149.
"Deposit," according to its commonly accepted and gen-
erally understood meaning among bankers and by the
public, includes not only deposits payable on demand and
subject to check, but deposits not subject ,to check, for
which certificates, whether interest-bearing or not, may
be issued, payable on demand, or on certain notice, or at
a fixed future time. Jones v. O'Brien, 58 S.D. 213, 235 N.
W. 654, 659.
In Insurance Law
The delivery by a life insurance company of
securities to state commissioner of insurance as
required by statutes. Central Life Assur. Soc. v.
Birmingham, D.C.Iowa, 48 F.Supp. 863, 865.

amount named therein has been received by the
bank; it is a receipt intended to furnish evidence
as between the depositor and depositary that on a
given date there was deposited the sum named
therein, the time of deposit, and amount deposited,
being also shown. In re Ruskay, C.C.A.N.Y., 5
F.2d 143, 147.

The party receiving a deposit;
one with whom anything is lodged in trust, as "de-
pository" is the place where it is put. A trustee;
fiduciary; one to whom goods are bailed to be
held without recompense. Stand. Diet. The ob-
ligation on the part of the depositary is that he
keep the thing with reasonable care, and, upon
request, restore it to the depositor, or otherwise
deliver it, according to the original trust. Brun-
ner v. Edwards, 337 Pa. 513, 12 A.2d 36, 37.

subject, and reduced to writing and duly authen-
ticated, and intended to be used upon the trial of
an action in court. It is sometimes used as sy-
nonymous with "affidavit" or "oath," but its techni-
cal meaning does not include such terms. State
v. Lord, 42 N.M. 638, 84 P.2d 80, 94.
A written declaration under oath, made upon
notice to the adverse party for the purpose of en-
abling him to attend and cross-examine; or upon

& Iron Works v. R. D. Cole Mfg. Co., 51 Okl. 353,
151 P. 1181, 1182. It is the giving of notice to the
adverse party which especially distinguishes a dep-
osition from an affidavit. Zinner v. Louis Meyers
& Son, 181 Misc. 344, 43 N.Y.S.2d 319, 320.
The term sometimes is used in a special sense

sentence declaratory in the proper court for fit and
sufficient causes or in pursuance of divers penal
statutes which declare the benefice void for some
nonfeasance or neglect, or some malfeasance or
crime. 3 Steph.Comm. 87, 88; Burn, Ecc.Law, tit.
"Deprivation." See Ayliffe, Parerg. 206; 1 Bla.
Comm. 393. See Degradation.
In American law. A taking away; confiscation;
as the deprivation of a constitutional right. Thus
Sundlun v. Zoning Board of Review of City of
Pawtucket, 50 R.I. 108, 145 A. 451, 454; or of lib-
erty. Lynch v. City of Muskogee, D.C.Okl., 47
F.Supp. 589, 592.

## DEPRIVE

To take. The term has this meaning
in a constitutional provision that no person shall
be "deprived of his property" without due process

a direct appropriation, dispossession of the owner.
Brown v. City of Atlanta, 167 Ga. 416, 145 S.E.
855, 857. It connotes want of consent. Sandel v.
State, 104 S.E. 567, 571, 115 S.C. 168, 13 A.L.R.

## DEPUTIZE

To appoint a deputy; to appoint or
commission one to act as deputy to an officer. In a
general sense, the term is descriptive of empower-
ing one person to act for another in any capacity
or relation, but in law it is almost always restricted
to the substitution of a person appointed to act
for an officer of the law.

## DEPUTY

A substitute; a person duly authorized
by an officer to exercise some or all of the func-
tions pertaining to the office, in the place and stead
of the latter. Byrnes v. Windels, 265 N.Y. 403, 193
N.E. 248, 249. One appointed to substitute for an-
other with power to act for him in his name or
behalf. Saxby v. Sonnemann, 149 N.E. 526, 528,
318 Ill. 600; Waggoner v. State, 183 Miss. 510, 184
So. 633, 634.
A deputy differs from an assignee, in that an assignee
has an interest in the office itself, and does all things in
his own name, for whom his grantor shall not answer, ex-
cept in special cases; but a deputy has not any Interest in
the office, and is only the shadow of the officer in whose
name he acts. And there is a distinction in doing an act
by an agent and by a deputy. An agent can only bind his
principal when he does the act in the name of the princi-
pal. But a deputy may do the act and sign his own name,
and it binds his principal; for a deputy has, in law, the
whole power of his principal. Wharton.
Deputy consul. See Consul.
Deputy lieutenant. The deputy of a lord lieu-
tenant of a county in England.
Deputy sheriff. One appointed to act in the
place and stead of the sheriff in the official busi-
ness of the latter's office. A general deputy (some-
times called "undersheriff"; see Shirran v. Dallas,
21 Cal.App. 405, 132 P. 454, 458; Delfelder v. Teton
Land & Investment Co., 46 Wyo. 142, 24 P.2d 702,
is one who, by virtue of his appointment, has au-
thority to execute all the ordinary duties of the of-
fice of sheriff, and who executes process without
any special authority from his principal. A spe-
cial deputy, who is an officer pro hac vice, is one
appointed for a special occasion or a special serv-
ice, as, to serve a particular writ or to assist in
keeping the peace when a riot or tumult is expect-
ed or in progress. He acts under a specific and
not a general appointment and authority. Allen
v. Smith, 12 N.J.Law, 162; Wilson v. Russell, 4
Dak. 376, 31 N.W. 645.
Deputy steward. A steward of a manor may
depute or authorize another to hold a court; and
as if the court had been holden by the chief stew•
and in person. So an under steward or deputy
may authorize another as subdeputy, pro hac vice,
to hold a court for him; such limited authority
not being inconsistent with the rule delegatus
non potest delegare. Wharton.
Special deputy. One appointed to exercise some
special function or power of the official or person
for whom he is appointed. Saxby v. Sonnemann,
318 Ill. 600, 149 N.E. 526, 528.
DERAIGN, Apparently, literally, to confound, and
disorder, or to turn out of course, or displace; as
deraignment or departure out of religion, in St.
31 Hen. VIII. c. 6. In the common law, the word
is used generally in the sense of to prove; viz., to
deraign a right, deraign the warranty, etc. Glanv.
lib. 2, c. 6; Fitzh.Nat.Brev. 146. Perhaps this
word "deraign," and the word "deraignment," de-
rived from it, may be used in the sense of to
prove and a proving, by disproving of what is
asserted in opposition to truth and fact. Jacob.
It is used as referring to a decree "which deraigns
his title from a false source." Paxson v. Brown,
61 F. 874, 884, 10 C.C.A. 135.

## DERAILER

A small but heavy iron device at-
tached to a rail which opens and closes over the
rail by a lever, so as to derail or turn off the track-
cars approaching the closed derailer from the ex-
pected direction. Brady v. Southern Ry. Co., 64
S.Ct. 232, 234, 320 U.S. 476, 88 L.Ed. 239.

## DERAILMENT

The act of going off or the state
of being off the rails of a railroad. Graham v.
Insurance Co. of North America, 220 Mass. 230,
107 N.E. 915.

## DERANGEMENT

## DERECHO

In Spanish law. Law or right. De-
recho comun, common law. The civil law is so
called. A right. Derechos, rights. Also, spe-
cifically, an impost laid upon goods or provisions,
or upon persons or lands, by way of tax or con.
tribution. Noe v. Card, 14 Cal. 576, 608.

## DERELICT

Forsaken; abandoned; deserted;
cast away.
Personal property abandoned or thrown away
by the owner in such manner as to indicate that
hp intends to make no further claim thereto. 2
Bl.Comm. 9; 2 Reeve, Eng.Law, 9; Thompson v.
One Anchor and Two Anchor Chains,, D.C.Wis.,
221 F. 770, 772.
Land left uncovered by the receding of water
from its former bed. 2 Rolle, Abr. 170; 2 Bl,
Comm. 262; 1 Crabb, Real Prop. 109.
In Maritime Law
A boat or vessel found entirely deserted or
abandoned on the sea without hope or intention of
recovery or return by the master or crew, whether
resulting from wreck, accident, necessity, or vol-
untary abandonment. U. S. v. Stone, C.C.Tenn., 8
F. 232-243; Cromwell v. The Island City, 1 Black
121, 17 L.Ed. 70; The Hyderabad, D.C.Wis., 11 F.
749-754; The No. 105, Belcher Oil Co. v. Griffin,
C.C.A.Fla., 97 F.2d 425, 426; Mengel Box Co. v.
Joest, 127 Miss. 461, 90 So. 161, 163.
Quasi Derelict
When a vessel, without being abandoned, is no
longer under the control or direction of those on
board, (as where part of the crew are dead, and
the remainder are physically and mentally in-
capable of providing for their own safety,) she
is said to be quasi derelict. Sturtevant v. Nicho-
laus, 1 Newb.Adm. 449, Fed.Cas.No.13,578. When
the crew have left their vessel temporarily, with
the intention of returning to resume possession,
she is not technically a derelict, but is what may
be termed a "quasi derelict." The Alcazar, D.C.
N.C., 227 F. 633, 650.

## DERELICTION

The gaining of land from the
water, in consequence of the sea shrinking back
below the usual water mark; the opposite of
alluvion (q. v.) Dyer, 326b; 2 Bl.Comm. 262; 1

owner, without the hope or the purpose of retun-
ing to the possession. Jones v. Nunn, 12 Ga. 473;

"Dereliction" or "renunciation" of property at sea as
well as on land requires both the intention to abandon and
external action. The No. 105, C.C.A.Fla., 97 F.2d 425, 426.
Derivativa potestas non potest esse major prim-
itiva. Noy, Max.; Wing.Max. 66. The derivative
power cannot be greater than the primitive. The
power which is derived cannot be greater than
that from which it is derived. Finch.Law, b. 1,
c. 3, p. 11.

## DERIVATIVE

Coming from another; taken
from something preceding; secondary; that which
has not its origin in itself, but owes its existence
to something foregoing. Anything obtained or
deduced from another. State v. Wong Fong, 75
Mont. 81, 241 P. 1072.

## DERIVATIVE ACTION

A suit by a shareholder
to enforce a corporate cause of action. The cor-
poration is a necessary party, and the relief which
is granted is a judgment against a third person in
favor of the corporation. Price v. Gurney, Ohio,
65 S.Ct. 513, 516, 324 U.S. 100, 89 L.Ed. 776.

## DERIVATIVE CONVEYANCES

Conveyances
which presuppose some other conveyance prece-
dent, and only serve to enlarge, confirm, alter, re-
strain, restore, or transfer the interest granted by
such original conveyance. They are releases, con-
firmations, surrenders, assignments, and defeas-
ances. 2 Bl.Comm. 324.

## DEROGATION

The partial repeal or abolishing
of a law, as by a subsequent act which limits its
scope or impairs its utility and force. Distin-
guished from abrogation, which means the entire
repeal and annulment of a law. Dig. 50, 17, 102.

## DEROGATORY CLAUSE

In a will, this is a sen-
tence or secret character inserted by the testator,
of which he reserves the knowledge to himself,
with a condition that no will he may make there-
after should be valid, unless this clause be insert-
ed word for word. This is done as a precaution
to guard against later wills being extorted by vio-
lence, or otherwise improperly obtained. By the
law of England such a clause would be void, as
tending to make the will irrevocable. Wharton.
Derogatur legi, cum pars detrahitur; abrogatur
legi, cum prorsus tollitur. To derogate from a
law is to take away part of it; to abrogate a law
is to abolish it entirely. Dig. 50, 17, 102.

## DESAFUERO

In Spanish law. An irregular ac-
tion committed with violence against law, custom,
or reason.

## DESAMORTIZACION

In Mexican law. The
desamortizacion of property is to take it out of
mortmain, (dead hands;) that is, to unloose it
from the grasp, as it were, of ecclesiastical or civil
corporations. The term has no equivalent in Eng-
lish. Hall, Mex.Law, § 749.

## DESCEND

To pass by succession; as when the
estate vests by operation of law in the heirs im-
mediately upon the death of the ancestor. Tra-
hern v. Woolwine, 109 W.Va. 623, 155 S.E. 909,
910. The term, as used in some statutes, includes
an acquisition by devise. Cordon v. Gregg, 164
Or. 306, 101 P.2d 414, 415.
To pass down from generation to generation.

To go ;—often used as a word of transfer. Gor-
don v. Cadwalader, 164 Cal. 509, 130 P. 18, 20.
As used in wills, the word "descend" is often regarded as
a general expression equivajent to the words "go to" or
"belong to," and as indicating a passing of title by the
force of the will rather than of the statute. Klingman v.
Gilbert, 90 Kan. 545, 135 P. 682, 684; Carter v. Reserve
Gas Co., 84 W.Va. 741, 100 S.E. 738, 742.

## DESCENDANT

One who is descended from an-
other; a person who proceeds from the body of
another, such as a child, grandchild, etc., to the
remotest degree. The term is the opposite of
"ascendant," (q. v.) Rasmusson v. Unknown Wife
of Hoge, 293 Ill. 101, 127 N.E. 356, 359; State v.
Yturria, 204 S.W. 315, 316, 109 Tex. 220, L.R.A.

by descent. Smith v. Thom, 158 Ky. 655, 166 S.W.
182. An heir. Lee v. Roberson, 297 Ill. 321, 130
N.E. 774, 778. In this sense, the term is frequent-
ly held to include an adopted child. In re Cad-
well's Estate, 26 Wyo. 412, 186 P. 499, 501. For
"Family," see that title.
Descendants is a good term of description in a will, and
includes all who proceed from the body of the person
named; as grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Amb.
397; 2 Hil.Real Prop. 242.
Lineal Descendant
One who is in the line of descent from the an-
cestor. Green v. Hussey, 228 Mass. 537, 117 N.E.
798. Lawful issue. Sassier v. J. Connelly Const.
Co., 227 Mich. 251, 198 N.W. 989, 991. The term
may include an adopted child; Denton v. Miller,
110 Kan. 292, 203 P. 693, 694; who is as lawfully
in the line of descent as if placed there by birth;
Fisher v. Gardnier, 183 Mich. 660, 150 N.W. 358.
Contra: State v. Yturria, 109 Tex. 220, 204 S.W.

## DESCENDER

Descent; in the descent. See For-
medon.

## DESCENDIBLE

Capable of passing by descent,
or of being inherited or transmitted by devise,
(spoken of estates, titles, offices, and other prop-
erty.) Collins v. Smith, 105 Ga. 525, 31 S.E. 449.

## DESCENT

Hereditary succession. Succession to
the ownership of an estate by inheritance, or by
any act of law, as distinguished from "purchase."
Title by descent is the title by which one person,
upon the death of another, acquires the real es-
tate of the latter as his heir at law. 2 Bl.Comm.
201; Adams v. Akerlund, 168 Ill. 632, 48 N.E.
454; In re Yahola's Heirship, 142 Okl. 79, 285 P.
946. The title by inheritance is in all cases called
descent, although by statute law the title is some-
times made to ascend.
"Descent" in its broadest sense signifies an inheritance
cast upon any one capable of receiving it, whether heir at
common law or not. Kicey v. Kicey, 114 N.J.Eq. 116, 168
A. 424, 426.
The division among those legally entitled there-
to of the real property of intestates.
Classification
Descents are of two sorts, lineal and collateral. Lineal
descent is descent in a direct or right line, as from father or
grandfather to son Dr grandson. In re Herrick's Estate,
273 N.Y.S. 803, 152 Misc. 9. Collateral descent is descent
in a collateral or oblique line, that is, up to the common
ancestor and then down from him, as from brother to
brother, or between cousins. Levy v. McCartee, 6 Pet. 112,
8 L.Ed. 334. They are also distinguished into mediate and
immediate descends. But these terms are used in different
senses. A descent may be said to be a mediate or immedi-
ate descent of the estate or right; or it may be said to be
mediate or immediate, in regard to the mediateness or im-
scent from the grandfather, who dies in possession, to the
grandchild, the father being then dead, or from the uncle
to the nephew, the brother being dead, is, in the former
sense, in law, immediate descent, although the one is
collateral and the other lineal; for the heir is in the per,
and not in the per and cut. On the other hand, with
reference to the line of pedigree or consanguinity, a descent
is often said to be immediate, when the ancestor from
whom the party derives his blood is immediate, and with-
out any intervening link or degrees; and mediate, when
the kindred is derived from him mediante altero, another
ancestor intervening between them. Thus a descent in
lineals from father to son is in this sense immediate;
but a descent from grandfather to grandson, the father
being dead, or from uncle to nephew, the brother being
dead, is deemed mediate; the father and the brother being,
in these latter cases, the medium deferens, as it is called,
of the descent or consanguinity. Furenes v. Mickelson, 86
Iowa, 508, 53 N.W. 416.
Descent was denoted, in the Roman law, by the
term "successio," which is also used by Bracton,
from which has been derived the succession of
the Scotch and French jurisprudence.
Line of Descent
The order or series of persons who have de-
scended one from the other or all from a common
ancestor, considered as placed in a line of suc-
cession in the order of their birth, the line show-
ing the connection of all the blood-relatives.
Collateral line. A line of descent connecting
persons who are not directly related to each other
as ascendants or descendants, but whose relation-
ship consists in common descent from the same
ancestor.
Direct line. A line of descent traced through
those persons only who are related to each other
directly as ascendants or descendants. State ex
rel. Walton v. Yturria, 109 Tex. 220, 204 S.W. 315,
316, L.R.A.1918F, 1079.
Maternal line. A line of descent or relationship
between two persons which is traced through the
mother of the younger.
Paternal line. A similar line of descent traced
through the father.
For "Family," see that title.

## DESCENT CAST

The devolving of realty upon
the heir on the death of his ancestor intestate.
Another name for what the older writers called
a "descent which tolls entry." When a person had
acquired land by disseisin, abatement, or intru-
sion, and died seised of the land, the descent of it
to his heir took away or tolled the real owner's
right of entry, so that he could only recover the
land by an action. Co.Litt. 237 b; Rap. & L. Dict.

## DESCRIBE

To narrate, express, explain. Boyn-
ton Real Estate Co. v. Woodbridge Tp., 94 N.J.
Law, 226, 109 A. 514, 515. Of land, to give the
metes and bounds. Livingston v. Seaboard Air
Line R. Co., 100 S.C. 18, 84 S.E. 303.

## DESCRIPTIO PERSONI

Lat. Description of
the person. By this is meant a word or phrase
used merely for the purpose of identifying or
pointing out the person intended, and not as an
which it occurs is to apply to him only in the of-
ficial or technical character which might appear
to be indicated by the word. . Forrester v. Cant-
ley, 227 Mo.App. 325, 51 S.W.2d 550, 551.
In wills, it frequently happens that the word heir is
used as a descriptio personce. A legacy "to the eldest son"
of A would be a designation of the person. See 1 Roper,
Leg. c. 2.

## DESCRIPTION

A delineation or account of a
particular subject by the recital of its characteris-
tic accidents and qualities. Ayliffe, Pand. 60.

larity, and without involving the idea of an ap-
praisement.

sive adoption by any one as part of a corporate
name. Sterling Products Corporation v. Sterling
Products, D.C.N.Y., 43 F.Supp. 548, 550; are not
registerable under the Trade-Mark Act § 2; 15
U.S.C.A. § 1052. Judson Dunaway Corp. v. Hy-
gienic Products Corp., 178 F.2d 461; and cannot

The act by which a seaman deserts and aban-
dons a ship or vessel, in which he had engaged to
perform a voyage, before the expiration of his
time, and without leave. By desertion, in the mari-
time law, is meant, not a mere unauthorized ab-
sence from the ship without leave, but an unau-
thorized absence from the ship, with an intention
not to return to her service, or, as it is often ex-
pressed, animo non revertendi; that is, with an
intention to desert. The Cripple Creek, D.C.Pa.,

Woodruff, 3 Fed.Cas. 424; Henderson v. Tompkins,

"Design, in the view of the patent law, is that character-
istic of a physical substance which, by means of lines,
images, configuration, and the like, taken as a whole,
makes an impression, through the eye, upon the mind of
the observer. The essence of a design resides not in the
elements individually, nor in their method of arrangement,
but in the tout ensemble—in that indefinable whole that
awakens some sensation in the observer's mind. Impres-
sions thus imparted may be complex or simple; * * *.
But whatever the impression, there is attached in the
mind of the observer, to the object observed, a sense of
uniqueness and character." Pelouze Scale & Mfg. Co. v.
American Cutlery Co., 102 F. 916, 919, 43 C.C.A. 52; Bay-
ley & Sons v. Braunstein Bros. Co., D.C.N.Y., 246 F. 314,

derstood to cease. (The appointment or designa-
tion of one is the exclusion of the other; and that
which is expressed prevails over that which is
implied.)

even a demand. Cleveland Clinic Foundation v.
Humphrys, C.C.A.Ohio, 97 F.2d 849, 857, 121 A.

law. It is brought to recover possession of im-
movable property, of which one has been despoil-
ed (despojado) by another. See, also, Despoil.

## DESPONSATION

The act of betrothing persons
to each other.

## DESPOSORIO

In Spanish law. Espousals; mu-
tual promises of future marriage. White, New
Recop. b. 1, tit. 6, c. 1, § 1.

## DESPOT

This word, in its original and most
simple acceptation, signifies master and supreme
lord; it is synonymous with monarch; but taken
in bad part, as it is usually employed, it signifies
a tyrant. In some states, despot is the title giv-
en to the sovereign, as king is given in others.
Enc. Lond.

## DESPOTISM

That abuse of government where
the sovereign power is not divided, but united in
the hands of a single man, whatever may be his
official title. It is not, properly, a form of gov-
ernment. Toullier, Dr.Civ.Fr. tit. prel. n. 32;
Rutherf. Inst. b. 1, c. 20, § 1.
"Despotism" is not exactly synonymous with
"autocracy," for the former involves the idea of
tyranny or abuse of power, which is not neces-
sarily implied by the latter. Every despotism is
autocratic; but an autocracy is not necessarily
despotic.

## DESRENABLE

L. Fr. Unreasonable. Britt. c.

## DESSAISISSEMENT

In French law. When a
person is declared bankrupt, he is immediately

Fr. Merc. Law, 556.

## DESTINATION

The purpose to which it is in-
tended an article or a fund shall be applied. A
testator gives a destination to a legacy when he
prescribes the specific use to which it shall be put.

called her "port of destination." Pardessus, no.
The phrases "port of destination" and "port of dis-
charge" are not equivalent; U. S. v. Barker, 5 Mason 404,
Fed.Cas.No.14,516. See Sheridan v. Ireland, 66 Me. 65.

## DESTITUTE OR NECESSITOUS CIRCUM- STANCES

Circumstances in which one needs
the necessaries of life, which cover not only prim-
itive physical needs, things absolutely indispensa-
ble to human existence and decency, but those
things, also, which are in fact necessary to the
particular person left without support. State v.
Waller, 90 Kan. 829, 136 P. 215, 217, 49 L.R.A.,N.S.,

stances" though she is being given shelter and food by a
child or by sympathizing relatives, friends, or strangers, if
she does not have property or money available for such
necessities or ordinary comforts of life as her husband can
reasonably furnish. State v. Sharp, 111 A. 909. 910, 1 W.W.
Harr., Del., 148; Brandel v. State, 161 Wis. 532, 154 N.W.

Harr. (Del.) 436; Donaghy v. State, 100 A. 696, 710, 6
Boyce (Del.) 467.

## DESTROY

As used in policies of insurance,
leases, and in maritime law, and under various
statutes, this term is often applied to an act which
renders the subject useless for its intended pur-
pose, though it does not literally demolish or an-
nihilate it. Davis v. Parker, 200 Ky. 847, 255 S.W.
836 (leased buildings) ; Louisville & N. R. Co. v.
Commonwealth, 190 Ky. 78, 226 S.W. 113, 117 (rail-

pose of preventing seizure. Pitkunas v. State, 183 Wis. 90,
197 N.W. 191, 192.
Land covered by spoil dirt from drainage channel is de-
stroyed within constitutional provision that land destroyed
for drainage purposes shall be paid for at a price not to
exceed assessed value for preceding year. Scott v. Red
River-Bayou Pierre Levee & Drainage Dist. of Louisiana,
La.App., 7 So.2d 429, 433.
In relation to wills, contracts, and other docu-
ments, the term "destroy" does not import the an-
nihilation of the instrument or its resolution into
other forms of matter, but a destruction of its
legal efficacy, which may be by cancellation, oblit-
erating, tearing into fragments, etc. In re Kapp's
Estate, 317 Pa. 253, 176 A. 501, 502.

## DESTRUCTION

A term used in old English law,

## DETAINER

The act (or the juridical fact) - of
withholding from a person lawfully entitled the
possession of land or goods, or the restraint of
a man's personal liberty against his will; deten-
tion.
The wrongful keeping of a person's goods is called an
"unlawful detainer" although the original taking may have
been lawful. As, if one distrains another's cattle, damage
feasant, and before they are impounded the owner tenders
sufficient amends; now, though the original taking was
lawful, the subsequent detention of them after tender of
amends is not lawful, and the owner has an action of re-
plevin to recover them, in which he will recover damages
for the detention, and not for the caption, because the orig-
inal taking was lawful. 3 Steph.Comm. 548.
In Practice
A writ or instrument, issued or made by a com-
petent officer, authorizing the keeper of a prison
to keep in his custody a person therein named.
A detainer may be lodged against one within the
walls of a prison, on what account soever he is
there. Com.Dig. "Process," E, (3 B.) This writ
was superseded by 1 & 2 Vict. c. 110, §§ 1, 2.
Forcible Detainer
See that title.

## DETAINMENT

This term is used in policies of
marine insurance, in the clause relating to "ar-
rests, restraints, and detainments." The last two
words are construed as equivalents, each meaning
the effect of superior force operating directly on
the vessel. Schmidt v. Insurance Co., 1 Johns.,
N.Y., 262, 3 Am.Dec. 319.

## DETECTION

which was hidden; investigation. Meunier v.
Bernich, La.App., 170 So. 567, 572.

## DETECTIVE

and furnish information concerning, alleged
wrongdoers by investigating their haunts and
habits. One whose business it is to detect crim-

aforesaid. Marconi Wireless Telegraph Co. of
America v. De Forest Radio Telephone & Tele-
graph Co., C.C.A.N.Y., 243 F. 560, 561. In wire-
less telegraphy, the "detector" or "coherer" and

the electromagnetic waves cause the indicator to
respond. National Electric Signaling Co. v. Tele-
funken Wireless Telegraph Co. of United States,

sion of all others. It forms the substance of pos-
session in all its varieties. Mackeld. Rom. Law, §
DETENTION. The act of keeping back or with-
holding, either accidentally or by design, a person
or thing. State v. Crappel, 181 La. 715, 160 So.
309. See Detainer.

eration in the substance of the thing, such as that
arising from decay, corrosion, or disintegration.

superficial hurt or impairment removable by the
simple process of cleansing, cannot be said to be
"deterioration" within the ordinary meaning of

London Assur. Corporation, 214 Mo.App. 672, 264
S.W. 433, 436.

## DETESTATIO

Lat. In the civil law. A sum-
moning made, or notice given, in the presence of
witnesses, (denuntiatio facts cum testatione.)
Dig. 50, 16, 40.
law. A species of action of debt, which lay for the
specific recovery of goods, under a contract to de-
liver them. 1 Reeves, Eng. Law, 159.
In Pleading
An action of debt is said to be in the detinet
when it is alleged merely that the defendant with-
holds or unjustly detains from the plaintiff the
thing or amount demanded.
An action of replevin is said to be in the de-
tinet when the defendant retains possession of
the property until after judgment in the action.
Bull, N.P. 52; Chit.Pl. 145.

## DETINUE

In practice. A form of action which
lies for the recovery, in specie, of personal chat-
tels from one who acquired possession of them
lawfully, but retains it without right, together
with damages for the detention. 3 Bl.Comm. 152.
Sinnott v. Feiock, 165 N.Y. 444, 59 N.E. 265, 53 L.
R.A. 565, 80 Am.St.Rep. 736.
The action of dettinue is defined in the old books as a
remedy founded upon the delivery of goods by the owner
to another to keep, who afterwards refuses to redeliver
them to the bailor; and it is said that, to authorize the
maintenance of the action, it is necessary that the defend-
ant should have come lawfully into the possession of the
chattel, either by delivery to him or by finding it. In fact,
it was once understood to be the law that detinue does not
lie where the property had been tortiously taken. But it
is, upon principle, very unimportant in what manner the
defendant's possession commenced, since the gist of the
action is the wrongful detainer, and not the original tak-
ing.
It is only incumbent upon the plaintiff to prove property
in himself, and possession in the defendant. At present,
the action of detinue is proper in every case where the
owner prefers recovering the specific property to damages
for its conversion, and no regard is had to the manner in
which the defendant acquired the possession. Tiefel Bros.
& Winn v. Maxwell, Tex.Civ.App., 154 S.W. 319, 320.
DETINUE OF GOODS IN FRANK MARRIAGE.
A writ formerly available to a wife after a di-
vorce, for the recovery of the goods given with
her in marriage. Mozley & Whitley.

## DETINUIT

In pleading. An action of replevin
is said to be in the detinuit when the plaintiff ac-
quires possession of the property claimed by
means of the writ. The right to retain is, of
course, subject in such case to the judgment of
the court upon his title to the property claimed.
Bull, N.P. 521.

## DETOUR

A temporary turning aside from us-
ual or regular route, course or procedure or from
a task or employment. Reddy-Waldhauer-Maf-
fett Co. v. Spivey, 53 Ga.App. 117, 185 S.E. 147,
A temporary road or a longer road in temporary
use because of an obstruction on regularly used

## DETRIMENT

Any loss or harm suffered in per-
son or property; e. g., the consideration for a
contract may consist not only in a payment or
other thing of value given, but also in loss or
"detriment" suffered by the promisee. In that
connection, "detriment" means that the promisee
has, in return for the promise, forborne some legal
right which he otherwise would have been entitled
to exercise. Wallace v. Cook, 190 Ky. 262, 227
S.W. 279, 281; or that he has given up something

which he had a right not to do. Irving v. Irwin,

Misappropriation of assets held in a fiduciary char-
acter; any violation or neglect of duty by an
executor or administrator, involving loss to the
decedent's estate, which makes him personally
responsible to heirs, creditors, or legatees. Mc-
Glaughlin v. McGlaughlin, 43 W.Va. 226, 27 S.E.
Also, if plaintiff, in an action against an executor or ad-
ministrator, has obtained judgment, the usual execution
runs de bonis testatoris; but, if the sheriff returns such
a writ nulla bona testatoris nec propria, the plaintiff may,
forthwith, upon this return, sue out an execution against
as full a manner as in an action against him, sued in his
own right. Such a return is called a "devastavit." Brown.

## DEVELOP

state or condition, as an injury. Rabin v. Cen-

93 Mont. 248, 89 A.L.R. 200; Jones v. Warmsprings
Irr. Dist., 162 Or. 186, 91 P.2d 542.

## DEVENERUNT

A writ, now obsolete, directed
to the king's escheators when any of the king's
tenants in capite dies, and when his son and heir
dies within age and in the king's custody, com.
manding the escheators, that by the oaths of
twelve good and lawful men they shall inquire
what lands or tenements by the death of the ten-
ant have come to the king. Dyer, 360; Termes
de la Ley; Keilw. 199a; Blount; Cowell.

## DEVEST

To deprive; to take away; to with-
draw. Usually spoken of an authority, power,

nifies to deliver the possession of anything to an-
other, so to devest signifies to take it away. Ja-
cob
•
It is sometimes written "divest" but "devest"
has the support of the best authority. Burrill.
DEVIATION.
In General
A change made in the progress of a work from
the original terms or design or method agreed
upon. Ward v. City of Monrovia, 16 Ca1.2d 815, 108

out necessity or reasonable cause, from the regi,
lar or usual route or from a stipulated or cus-
tomary mode of carriage. Ward v. Gulf, M. & N.

scribed in the policy, without necessity or just
cause, after the risk has begun. 1 Phil.Ins. §
977, et seq.; 1 Arn.Ins. 415, et seq. Hostetter v.
Park, 137 U.S. 30, 11 Sup.Ct. 1, 34 L.Ed. 568.

A departure on the part of a servant from his
master's service, for some purpose of his own.
Jeffries v. Jodawelky, 304 Mich. 421, 8 N.W.2d
121, 122. The liability of the master to third per-
sons injured by the servant depends on the de-
gree of deviation and all the attending circum-
stances. Johnson v. Maryland Cass Co., C.C.A.
Wis., 125 F.2d 337, 338. To exonerate the master,
the deviation must be so substantial as to amount
to an entire departure, and must be for purposes
entirely personal to the servant. Thomas v.
Lockwood Oil Co., 174 Wis. 486, 182 N.W. 841, 843.
Contra, it is held that the test is whether master
impliedly consented to route taken, and there
can be no such thing as a slight deviation. Kalin-
owski v. Odlewany, 289 Mich. 684, 287 N.W. 344,
345. As to a distinction between "deviation," "tem-
porary abandonment," and "complete abandon-
ment," see Dockweiler v. American Piano Co., 94
Misc. 712, 160 N.Y.S. 270, 273.

per was his will. 7 Brown, Parl.Cas, 437; 2 Atk.

## DEVISE

A testamentary disposition of land or
realty; a gift of real property by the last will and
testament of the donor. Scholle v. Scholle, 113
N.Y. 261, 21 N.E. 84; Murchison v. Wallace, 156
Va, 728, 159 S.E. 106, 108.
Classification
Devises are contingent or vested; that is, after the death
of the testator. Contingent, when the vesting of any
estate in the devisee is made to depend upon some future
event, in which case, if the event never occur, or until it
does occur, no estate vests under the devise. But, when
the future event is referred to merely to determine the
time at which the devisee shall come into the use of the
estate, this does not hinder the vesting of the estate at the
death of the testator. 1 Jarm.Wills, c. 26. Devises are
also classed as general or specific. A general devise is one
which passes lands of the testator without a particular
enumeration or description of them; as, a devise of "all
my lands" or "all my other lands." In a more restricted
sense, a general devise is one which grants a parcel of land
without the addition of any words to show how great an
estate is meant to be given, or without words indicating
either a grant in perpetuity or a grant for a limited term;
in this case it is construed as granting a life estate. Hitch
v. Patten, 8 Houst. (Del.) 334, 16 A. 558, 2 L.R.A. 724.
Specific devises are devises of lands particularly specified in
the terms of the devise, as opposed to general and residu-
ary devises of land, in which the local or other particular
descriptions are not expressed. For example, "I devise my
Hendon Hall estate" is a specific devise; but "I devise all
my lands," or, "all other my lands," is a general devise or
a residuary devise. But all devises are (in effect) specific,
even residuary devises being so. L.R. 3 Ch. 420; Id. 136.
At common law, all devises of land were deemed to be
"specific" whether the land was identified in the devise or
passed under the residuary clause. In re Sutton's Estate,
11 Del.Ch. 460, 97 A. 624, 626. A conditional devise is one
which depends upon the occurrence of some uncertain
event, by which it is either to take effect or be defeated.
'An executory devise of lands is such a disposition of them
by will that thereby no estate vests at the death of the
devisor, but only on some future contingency. It differs
from a remainder in three very material points ; (1) That
it needs not any particular estate to support it; (2) that
by it a fee-simple or other less estate may be limited after
a fee-simple; (3) that by this means a remainder may be
limited of a chattel interest, after a particular estate for
life created in the same. 2 Bl.Comm. 172. In a stricter
sense, a limitation by will of a future contingent interest in
lands, contrary to the rules of the common law. 4 Kent,
Comm. 263; 1 Steph.Comm. 564; Dean v. Crews, 77 Fla.
319, 81 So. 479. A limitation by will of a future estate or
interest in land, which cannot, consistently with the rules
of law, take effect as a remainder. 2 Pow.Dev. (by Jar-
man,) 237; Bean v. Atkins, 87 Vt. 376, 89 A. 643, 646. See
Poor v. Considine, 6 Wall. 474, 18 L.Ed. 869; Glover v.
Condell, 163 Ill. 566, 45 N.E. 173, 35 L.R.A. 360. A future
interest taking effect as a fee in derogation of a defeasible
will, is an "executory devise," and, when created by deed,
is a "conditional limitation," and in either event is given
effect as a shifting or springing use. McWilliams v. Have-
ly, 214 Ky. 320, 283 S.W. 103, 104.
The estates known as a contingent remainder and an "ex-
ecutory devise" are both interests or estates in land to
take effect in the future and depend upon a future con-
tingency; an "executory devise" being an interest which
the rules of law do not permit to be created in convey-
ances, but allow in case of wills. It follows a fee estate
created by a will. A contingent remainder may be created
by will or other conveyance and must follow a particular
or temporary estate created by the same instrument of
conveyance. Wilkins v. Rowan, 107 Neb. 180, 185 N.W. 437,
439. Lapsed devise. A devise which fails, or takes no ef-
fect, in consequence of the death of the devisee before the
testator; the subject-matter of it being considered as not
disposed of by the will. 1 Steph.Comm. 559; 4 Kent,
Comm. 541. Murphy v. McKeon, 53 N.J.Eq. 406, 32 A. 374.
Residuary devise. A devise of all the residue of the testa-
tor's real property, that is, all that remains over and above
the other devises.
Synonyms
The term "devise" is properly restricted to real prop-
erty; testamentary dispositions of personal property being
properly called "bequests" or "legacies." Borgner v.
Brown, 133 Ind. 391, 33 N.E. 92.

that is, an observation or remark made by a judge
in pronouncing an opinion upon a cause, con-
cerning some rule, principle, or application of law,
or the solution of a question suggested by the
case at bar, but not necessarily involved in the
case or essential to its determination; any state-
ment of the law enunciated by the court merely
by way of illustration, argument, analogy, or sug-
gestion. See Railroad Co. v. Schutte, 103 U.S.

Dicta are opinions of a judge which do not embody the
resolution or determination of the court, and made without
argument, or full consideration of the point, are not the
professed deliberate determinations of the judge himself.
Obiter dicta are such opinions uttered by the way, not
upon the point or question pending, as if turning aside for
the time from the main topic of the case to collateral sub-
jects. Rohrbach v. Insurance Co., 62 N.Y. 47, 58, 20 Am.
Rep. 451.
In Old English Law
Dictum meant an arbitrament, or the award of

## DIGEST

A collection or compilation, embodying
the chief matter of numerous books in one, dis-
posed under proper heads or titles, and usually by
an alphabetical arrangement, for facility in ref-
erence.
As a legal term, "digest" is to be distinguished from
"abridgment." The latter is a summary or epitome of the
contents of a single work, in which, as a rule, the original
order or sequence of parts is preserved, and in which the
principal labor of the compiler is in the matter of consoli-
dation. A digest is wider in its scope ; is made up of
quotations or paraphrased passages ; and has its own sys-
tem of classification and arrangement. An "index" mere-
ly points out the places where particular matters may be
found, without purporting to give such matters in extenso.
A "treatise" or "commentary" is not a compilation, but an
original composition, though it may include quotations and
excerpts.
A reference to the "Digest," or "Dig.," is always
understood to designate the Digest (or Pandects)
of the Justinian collection; that being the digest
par eminence, and the authoritative compilation
of the Roman law.
The American Digest System embraces the Cen-
tury, First, Second, Third, Fourth Decennials, and
General Digest. It covers the decisions of all
American courts of last resort, State and Federal,
from 1658 to date, under one uniform classifica-
tion. The First Decennial, Second Decennial,
Third Decennial, Fourth Decennial and General
Digest, are Key-Numbered. There are also the
United States Supreme Court Digest, covering all
cases in that court, and the Federal Digest, cov-
and the Supreme Court Reporter.

## DIGESTA

Digests. One of the titles of the Pan-
dects of Justinian. Inst. Prcem, § 4. Bracton
uses the singular, "Digestum." Bract. fol. 19.

## DIGESTS

The ordinary name of the Pandects of
Justinian, which are now usually cited by the ab-
breviation "Dig." instead of "Ff.," as formerly.
Sometimes called "Digest," in the singular.

## DIGGING

Has been held as synonymous with
"excavating," and not confined to the removal of
earth. Sherman v. New York, 1 N.Y. 316.

## DIGNITARY

In canon law. A person holding an
ecclesiastical benefice or dignity, which gave him
some pre-eminence above mere priests and canons.
To this class exclusively belonged all bishops,
deans, archdeacons, etc.; but it now includes all
the prebendaries and canons of the church.

## DIGNITY

In English law. An honor; a title,
station, or distinction of honor. Dignities are a

seq.

## DILACION

In Spanish law. A space of time

demand or produce evidence of a disputed fact.

## DILAPIDATION

A species of ecclesiastical
waste which occurs whenever the incumbent suf-
fers any edifices of his ecclesiastical living to go to
ruin or decay. It is either voluntary, by pulling
down, or permissive, by suffering the church,
parsonage-houses, and other buildings thereunto
belonging, to decay. And the remedy for either
lies either in the spiritual court, where the canon
law prevails, or in the courts of common law. It
is also held to be good cause of deprivation if the
bishop, parson, or other ecclesiastical person dilap-
idates buildings or cuts down timber growing on
the patrimony of the church, unless for necessary
repairs; and that a writ of prohibition will also
lie against him in the common-law courts. 3 Bl.
Comm. 91.
The term is also used, in the law of landlord and
tenant, to signify the neglect of necessary re-
pairs to a building, or suffering it to fall into a
or any part of it. Wall Estate Co. v. Standard
Box Co., 20 Cal.App. 311, 128 P. 1020, 1021.

DILATORY EXCEPTIONS are such as do not
tend to defeat the action, but only to retard its
progress.

## DILATORY PLEAS

A class of defenses at com-
mon law, founded on some matter of fact not con-
nected with the merits of the case, but such as
might exist without impeaching the right of action
itself. They were either pleas to the jurisdiction,
showing that, by reason of some matter therein
stated, the case was not within the jurisdiction
of the court; or pleas in suspension, showing some
matter of temporary incapacity to proceed with
the suit; or pleas in abatement, showing some
matter for abatement or quashing the declaration.
3 Steph.Comm. 576. Parks v. McClellan, 44 N.J.
Law, 513, 558; Shaw v. Southern Ry. Co., 17 Ga.
App. 78, 86 S.E. 95.

## DILIGENCE

Prudence; vigilant activity; at-
tentiveness; or care, of which there are infinite
shades, from the slightest momentary thought to
the most vigilant anxiety. People v. Hewitt, 78
Cal.App. 426, 248 P. 1021, 1024. The law recog-
nizes only three degrees of diligence: (1) Com-
mon or ordinary, which men, in general, exert
in respect of their own concerns; the standard is
necessarily variable with respect to the facts, al-
though it may be uniform with respect to the
principle. (2) High or great, which is extraor-
dinary diligence, or that which very prudent per-
sons take of their own concerns. (3) Low or
slight, which is that which persons of less than
common prudence, or indeed of no prudence at
all, take of their own concerns. Brown & Flowers
v. Central of Georgia Ry. Co., 197 Ala. 71, 72 So.
366, 367.
The civil law is in perfect conformity with the
common law. It lays down three degrees of dili-
gence,—ordinary, (diligentia;) extraordinary,
(exactissima diligentia;) slight, (levissima diligen-
tia.) Story, Bailm. 19.
There may be a high degree of diligence, a common de-
gree of diligence, and a slight degree of diligence, with
their corresponding degrees of negligence, and these can
be clearly enough defined for all practical purposes, and,
with a view to the business of life, seem to be all that are
really necessary. Common or ordinary diligence is that
degree of diligence which men in general exercise in re-
spect to their own concerns ; high or great diligence is of
course extraordinary diligence, or that which very prudent
persons take of their own concerns; and low or slight dili-
gence is that which persons of less than common prudence,
or indeed of any prudence at all, take of their own con-
cerns.
slight, or less than ordinary, negligence is the want of
great diligence; and gross or more than ordinary negli-
gence is the want of slight diligence. Railroad Co. v. Rol-
lins, 5 Kan. 180.

Process of law, by which persons, lands, or ef-
fects are seized in execution or in security for
debt. Ersk. Inst. 2, 11, 1. Brande. Process for

DIRECTORY, adj. A provision in a statute, rule
of procedure, or the like, which is a mere direction
or instruction of no obligatory force, and involv-
ing no invalidating consequence for its disregard,
as opposed to an imperative or mandatory provi-
sion, which must be followed. In re Opinion of
the Justices, 124 Me. 453, 126 A. 354, 363. The
general rule is that the prescriptions of a statute
relating to the performance of a public duty are
so far directory that, though neglect of them may
be punishable, yet it does not affect the validity
of the acts done under them, as in the case of a
statute requiring an officer to prepare and deliver
a document to another officer on or before a cer-
tain day. And see Pearse v. Morrice, 2 Adol. &
El. 94; Nelms v. Vaughan, 84 Va. 696, 5 S.E. 704.
A "directory" provision in a statute is one, the observ-
ance of which is not necessary to the validity of the pro-
ceeding to which it relates; State v. Barnell, 109 Ohio St.
246, 142 N.E. 611, 613; one which leaves it optional with
the department or officer to which it is addressed to obey
or not as he may see fit; In re Thompson, 94 Neb. 658,
144 N.W. 243, 244.
Statutory requisitions are deemed "directory" only when
they relate to some immaterial matter where a compliance
is matter of convenience rather than of substance. This
mode of getting rid of a statutory provision by calling it
"directory" is not only unsatisfactory, on account of the
vagueness of the rule itself, but it is the exercise of a
dispensing power by the courts, which approaches so near
legislative discretion that it ought to be resorted to with
reluctance, only in extraordinary cases, where great public
mischief would otherwise ensue, or important private in-
terests demand the application of the rule. Ellis v. Till-
man, 125 Miss. 678, 88 So. 281, 283.
Directory calls. Those which merely direct the
neighborhood where the different calls may be
found, whereas "locative calls" are those which
serve to fix boundaries. Cates v. Reynolds, 143
Tenn. 667, 228 S.W. 695, 696.
Directory statute. Under a general classifica-
tion, statutes are either "mandatory" or "direc-
tory," and, if mandatory, they prescribe, in addi-
tion to requiring the doing of the things specified,
the result that will follow if they are not done,
whereas, if directory, their terms are limited to
what is required to be done. Hudgins v. Moores-
ville Consol. School Dist., 312 Mo. 1, 278 S.W. 769,
770. A statute is mandatory when the provision
of the statute is the essence of the thing required
to be done; otherwise, when it relates to form and
manner, and where an act is incident, or after ju-
risdiction acquired, it is directory merely. State
v. Kozer, 108 Or. 550, 217 P. 827, 832.
Directory trust. Where, by the terms of a trust,
the fund is directed to be vested in a particular
appropriated, this is called a "directory trust." It
is distinguished from a discretionary trust, in
which the trustee has a discretion as to the man-
agement of the fund. Deaderick v. Cantrell, 10
Yerg. (Tenn.) 272, 31 Am.Dec. 576.

## DIRECTORY

Book containing names, addres-
ses, and occupations of inhabitants of city. Also
any list or compilation, usually in book or pamph-
let form, of persons, firms or corporations forming
some class separate and distinct from others, e.
g., telephone directory, hotel directory, etc.
American Travel & Hotel Directory Co. v. Gehring
Publishing Co., D.C., 4 F.2d 415.

## DIRIBITORES

In Roman law. Officers who dis-
tributed ballots to the people, to be used in voting.
Tayl. Civil Law, 192.

## DIRIMENT IMPEDIMENTS

In canon law. Ab-
solute bars to marriage, which would make it null
oh initio.

## DIRT

Filth or excrement; garden loam; earth
or soil, especially when loose; dust; garden earth.
Highley v. Phillips, 176 Md. 463, 5 A.2d 824, 827.

## DISABILITY

The want of legal capability to
perform an act. Berkin v. Marsh, 18 Mont. 152, 44
Pac. 528, 56 Am.St.Rep. 565.
A crippled condition. Kimbrough v. National
Protective Ins. Ass'n, 225 Mo.App. 913, 35 S.W.2d
654, 657.
At the present day, disability is generally used to indi-
cate an incapacity for the full enjoyment of ordinary le-
gal rights; thus married women, persons under age, insane
persons, and felons convict are said to be under disability.
Sometimes the term is used in a more limited sense, as
when it signifies an impediment to marriage, or the re-
straints placed upon clergymen by reason of their spiritual
avocations. Mozley & Whitley.
Classification
Disability is either general or 'special; the for-
mer when it incapacitates the person for the per-
formance of all legal acts of a general class, or
giving to them their ordinary legal effect; the
latter when it debars him from one specific act.
State ex rel. Sathre v. Moodie, 258 N.W. 558, 567,
65 N.D. 340. Disability is also either personal or
absolute; the former where it attaches to the
particular person, and arises out of his status,
his previous act, or his natural or juridical in-
capacity; State ex rel. Olson v. Langer, 65 N.D.
68, 256 N.W. 377; the latter where it originates
with a particular person, but extends also to his
descendants or successors. Lord de le Warre's
Case, 6 Coke, la; Avegno v. Schmidt, 5 Sup.Ct.
487, 113 U.S. 293, 28 L.Ed. 976. Considered with
special reference to the capacity to contract a
marriage, disability is either canonical or civil;
a disability of the former class makes the mar-
riage voidable only, while the latter, in general,
avoids it entirely. However, it has been held that,
in the absence of statute, a court does not have ju-
risdiction to annul a marriage for a canonical dis-
ability. D. v. D., 2 Terry 263, 20 A.2d 139, 141.
The term civil disability is also used as equiva-
disability, both these expressions
meaning disabilities or disqualifications created
by positive law, as distinguished from physical dis-
abilities. Stieffel v. Valentine Sugars, 188 La.
1091, 179 So. 6, 15. A physical disability is a dis-
ability or incapacity caused by physical defect or
infirmity, or bodily imperfection, or mental weak-
ness or alienation; as,distinguished from civil dis-
ability, which relates to the civil status or con-
dition of the person, and is imposed by the law.
Absence of competent physical, intellectual, or
moral powers; impairment of earning capacity ;
loss of physical function that reduces efficiency;
inability to work. Rorabaugh v. Great Eastern
Casualty Co., 117 Wash. 7, 200 P.2d 587, 590.
Temporary Disability
Temporary, as distinguished from permanent,
disability is a condition that exists until the in-
jured employee is as far restored as the permanent
character of the injuries will permit. Consolidat-
ed Coal Co. of St. Louis v. Industrial Commission,
311 Ill. 61, 142 N.E. 498, 500.
Total Disability
Total disability to follow insured's usual occu-
pation arises where he is incapacitated from per-
forming any substantial part of his ordinary du-
ties, though still able to perform a few minor du-
ties and be present at his place of business. Fi-
delity & Casualty Co. of New York v. Bynum, 221
Ky. 450, 298 S.W. 1080, 1082. "Total disability"
within an accident policy does not mean absolute
physical disability to transact any business per-
taining to insured's occupation, but disability from
performing substantial and material duties con-
nected with it. Jacobs v. Loyal Protective Ins.
Co., 97 Vt. 516, 124 A. 848, 852; Brown v. Missouri
State Life Ins. Co., 136 S.C. 90, 134 S.E. 224-225.
The term may also apply to any impairment of
mind or body rendering it impossible for insured
to follow continuously a substantially gainful oc-
cupation without seriously impairing his health,
the disability being permanent when of such na-
ture as to render it reasonably certain to continue
throughout the lifetime of insured. Starnes v. U.
S., D.C.Tex., 13 F.2d 212, 213. See, also, Wholly
Disabled.

## DISABLE

Ordinarily, to take away the ability
of, to render incapable of proper and effective ac-
tion. Federal Union Life Ins. Co. of Cincinnati,
Ohio v. Richey's Adm'x, 256 Ky. 262, 75 S.W.2d
767, 768.
In the old language of pleading, to disable is to
take advantage of one's own or another's disabili-
ty. Thus, it is "an express maxim of the common
law that the party shall not disable himself;"
but "this disability to disable himself * * * is
personal." 4 Coke, 123b.

## DISABLING STATUTES

These are acts of par-
liament, restraining and regulating the exercise
of a right or the power of alienation; the term is
specially applied to 1 Eliz. c. 19, and similar acts
restraining the power of ecclesiastical corporations
to make leases.

## DISADVOCARE

To deny a thing.

## DISAFFIRM

To repudiate; to revoke a consent
once given; to recall an affirmance. To refuse
one's subsequent sanction to a former act; to dis-
claim the intention of being bound by an antece-
dent transaction.

## DISAFFIRMANCE

The repudiation of a former
transaction. The refusal by one who has the legal
power to refuse, (as in the case of a voidable con-
tract,) to abide by his former acts, or accept the
legal consequences of them. It may either be
"express" (in words) or "implied" from acts in-
consistent with a recognition of validity of former
transaction. Ryan v. Morrison, 40 Okl. 49, 135
P. 1049, 1050.

## DISAFFOREST

To restore to their former condi-
tion lands which have been turned into forests.
To remove from the operation of the forest laws.
2 Bl.Comm. 416.

## DISAGREEMENT

Difference of opinion or want
of uniformity or concurrence of views; as, a dis-
agreement among the members of a jury, among
the judges of a court, or between arbitrators. Dar-
nell v. Lyon, 85 Tex. 466, 22 S.W. 304.
In Real Property Law
The refusal by a grantee, lessee, etc., to accept
an estate, lease, etc., made to him; the annulling
of a thing that had essence before. No estate can
be vested in a person against his will. Conse-
quently no one can become a grantee, etc., without
his agreement. The law implies such an agree-
ment until the contrary is shown, but his disagree-
ment renders the grant, etc., inoperative. Whar-
ton.

## DISALT

To disable a person.

## DISALLOW

To refuse to allow, to deny the va-
lidity of, to disown or reject. Stewart v. Yellow-
tail, D.C.Mont., 35 F.Supp. 798, 799.

## DISAPPROPRIATION

In ecclesiastical law.
This is where the appropriation of a benefice is
severed, either by the patron presenting a clerk or
by the corporation which has the appropriation
being dissolved. 1 Bl.Comm. 385.

## DISAPPROVE

To pass unfavorable judgment
upon; to refuse official approbation to; to disal-
low; to decline to sanction; to refuse to confirm,
ratify or consent to. Stewart v. Yellowtail, D.C.
Mont., 35 F.Supp. 798, 799.

## DISASTER

A sudden and ruinous misfortune,
hence, one who had been pronounced by eminent
physicians to be afflicted with dementia praecox,
who had nervous breakdown, and who was with-
out funds or ability to earn them by either mental
or physical exertion, was overtaken by disaster.
Robison v. Elston Bank & Trust Co., 113 Ind.App.
633, 48 N.E.2d 181, 188.

## DISAVOW

To repudiate the unauthorized acts
of an agent; to deny the authority by which he
assumed to act.
manently of the privileges of his position; it is
analogous to striking an attorney off the rolls. In
America, the word describes the act of a court in
rescinding an attorney's license to practice at its
bar. Gresham v. Superior Court of Los Angeles
County, 44 Cal.App.2d 664, 112 Pd 965, 967.

## DISBOCATIO

In old English law. A conversion
of wood grounds into arable or pasture; an assart-
ing. Cowell. See Assart.

## DISBURSEMENTS

Money paid out or expended
for which one is entitled to a credit upon render-
ing an account of his doings. Tinkler v. Powell,
23 Wyo. 352, 151 P. 1097, 1098.
The term is also used under the codes of civil
procedure, to designate the expenditures neces-
sarily made by a party in the progress of an ac-
tion, aside from the fees of officers and court
costs, which are allowed, eo nomine, together with
costs. Fertilizer Co. v. Glenn, 48 S.C. 494, 26 S.E.
796; Sasser v. Stuyvesant Ins. Co., 258 App.Div.
340, 16 N.Y.S.2d 401, 402, 403.

## DISCARCARE

In old English law. To dis-
charge, to unload; as a vessel. Carcare et discar-
care; to charge and discharge; to load and un-
load. Cowell.

## DISCARGARE

In old European law. To dis-
charge or unload, as a wagon. Spelman.

## DISCEPTIO CAUSE

In Roman law. The argu-
ment of a cause by the counsel on both sides.
Calvin.

## DISCHARGE

To release, Clark v. Sperry, 125
W.Va. 718, 25 S.E.2d 870, 872; liberate, People ex
rel. La Velle v. Trophagen, 236 N.Y.S. 214, 216, 134
Misc. 604; annul, Glaser v. Haskin, 140 Or. 392,
13 P.2d 1071, 1074; unburden; disincumber; dis-
miss, The Losmar, D.C.Md., 20 F.Supp. 887, 891;

App. 529, 41 N.E.2d 979, 981; remove from employ-
ment, Bourne v. Board of Education of City of
Roswell, 46 N.M. 310, 128 P.2d 733, 735.
In the Law of Contracts
To cancel or unloose the obligation of a con-
tract; to make an agreement or contract null and
inoperative. As a noun, the word means the act
or instrument by which the binding force of a con-
tract is terminated, irrespective of whether the
contract is carried out to the full extent contem-
plated (in which case the discharge is the result of
performance) or is broken off before complete
execution. Rivers v. Blom, 163 Mo. 442, 63 S.W.
Discharge is a generic term; its principal species are re-
scission, release, accord and satisfaction, performance,
judgment, composition, bankruptcy, merger (q. v.) .
Leake, Cont. 413.
As applied to demands, claims, rights of action,
incumbrances, etc., to discharge the debt or claim
is to extinguish it, to annul its obligatory force,
to satisfy it. And here also the term is generic;
thus a debt, a mortgage, a legacy, may be dis-
charged by payment or performance, or by any
act short of that, lawful in itself, which the credi-
tor accepts as sufficient. Blackwood v. Brown,
29 Mich. 484; Rangely v. Spring; 28 Me. 151. To
discharge a person is to liberate him from the
binding force of an obligation, debt, or claim.
There is a distinction between a "debt discharged" and
a "debt paid." When discharged the debt still exists
though divested of its character as a legal obligation dur-
ing the operation of the discharge. Something of the
original vitality of the debt continues to exist which may
be transferred, even though the transferee takes it sub-
ject to its disability incident to the discharge. The fact
that it carries something which may be a consideration for
a new promise to pay, so as to make an otherwise worth-
less promise a legal obligation, makes it the subject of
transfer by assignment. Stanek v. White, 172 Minn. 390,
215 N.W. 784.
Discharge by operation of law is where the discharge
takes place, whether it was intended by the parties or
not; thus, if a creditor appoints his debtor his executor,
the debt is discharged by operation of law, because the
executor cannot have an action against himself. Co. Litt.
264b, note 1; Williams, Ex'rs, 1216; Chit.Cont. 714.
In Bankruptcy Practice
The discharge of the bankrupt is the step which
regularly follows the adjudication of bankruptcy
and the administration of his estate. By it he is
released from the obligation of all his debts which
were or might be proved in the proceedings, so
that they are no longer a charge upon him, and
so that he may thereafter engage in business and
acquire property without its being liable for the
satisfaction of such former debts. Pitcairn v.
Scully, 252 Pa. 82, 97 A. 120, 121.
In Civil Practice
To discharge a rule, an order, an injunction, a
certificate, process of execution, or in general any
proceeding in a court, is to cancel or annul it, or
to revoke it, or to refuse to confirm its original
provisional force. Nichols v. Chittenden, 14 Colo.
App. 49, 59 P. 954.
To discharge a jury is to relieve them from any
further consideration of a cause. This is done
when the continuance of the trial is, by any cause,
rendered impossible; also when the jury, after
deliberation, cannot agree on a verdict.
In Criminal Practice
The act by which a person in confinement, held
on an accusation of some crime or misdemeanor,
is set at liberty. The writing containing the order
for his being so set at liberty is also called a "dis-
charge." In re Eddinger, 236 Mich. 668, 211 N.W.
In Equity Practice
In the process of accounting before a master
in chancery, the discharge is a statement of ex-
penses and counter-claims brought in and filed, by
way of set-off, by the accounting defendant;
which follows the charge in order.
In Maritime Law
The unlading or unlivery of a cargo from a ves-
sel. The Bird of Paradise v. Heyneman, 5 Wall.
557, 18 L.Ed. 662.
In Military Law
The release or dismissal of a soldier, sailor, or
marine, from further military service, either at
the expiration of his term of enlistment, or previ-
ous thereto on special application therefor, or as
a punishment. An "honorable" discharge is one
granted at the end of an enlistment and accom-
panied by an official certificate of good conduct
during the service. A "dishonorable" discharge is
a dismissal from the service for bad conduct or as
a punishment imposed by sentence of a court-mar-
tial for offenses against the military law. There
is also in occasional use a form of "discharge
without honor," which implies censure, but is not
in itself a punishment. U. S. v. Sweet, 23 S.Ct.
638, 189 U.S. 471, 47 L.Ed. 907.
A discharge from the army is the discharge given one
who was actually in military service, as distinguished
from a mere discharge from draft. Patterson v. Lamb,
App.D.C., 67 S.Ct. 448, 329 U.S. 539, 91 L.Ed. 485.
A discharge from draft is the discharge given selectees
who reported for military service in World War I and were
rejected at camp after induction for unfitness, dependency
and the like. Thus a selectee who reported on November
11, 1918 but was told that draft call was cancelled because
of the armistice was properly given a discharge from draft,
rather than a discharge from the army and could not claim
veterans' rights. Patterson v. Lamb, App.D.C., 67 S.Ct.
448, 329 U.S. 539, 91 L.Ed. 485.

## DISCIPLINE

Instruction, comprehending the
communication of knowledge and training to ob-
serve and act in accordance with rules and orders.
In re Swenson, 183 Minn. 602, 237 N.W. 589.
Correction, chastisement, punishment, penalty.
Rules and regulations. Reutkemeier v. Nolte, 179
Iowa, 342, 161 N.W. 290, 292, L.R.A.1917D, 273.

## DISCLAIMER

The repudiation or renunciation
of a claim or power vested in a person or which
he had formerly alleged to be his. The refusal,
or rejection of an estate or right offered to a per-
son. The disavowal, denial, or renunciation of an
interest, right, or property imputed to a person
or alleged to be his. Also the declaration, or the
instrument, by which such disclaimer is published.
Moores v. Clackamas County, 40 Or. 536, 67 P.
Of Estate
The act by which a party refuses to accept an
estate which has been conveyed to him. Thus,
a trustee who releases to his fellow-trustees his
estate, and relieves himself of the trust, is said
to disclaim. Kentucky Union Co. v. Cornett, 112
Ky. 677, 66 S.W. 728.
A renunciation or a denial by a tenant of his
landlord's title, either by refusing to pay rent,
denying any obligation to pay, or by setting up a
title in himself or a third person, and this is a
distinct ground of forfeiture of the lease or other
tenancy, whether of land or tithe. See 16 Ch. Div.
In Patent Law
When the title and specifications of a patent
do not agree, or when part of that which it covers
is not strictly patentable, because neither new nor
useful, the patentee is empowered, with leave of
the court, to enter a disclaimer of any part of
either the title or the specification, and the dis-
claimer is then deemed to be part of the letters
patent or specification, so as to render them valid
for the future. Permutit Co. v. Wadham, C.C.A.
Mich., 15 F.2d 20, 21.
In Pleading
A renunciation by the defendant of all claim to
the subject of the demand made by the plaintiff's
bill. Wilson v. McCoy, 93 W.Va. 667, 117 S.E. 473,
DISCLAMATION. In Scotch law. Disavowal of
tenure; denial that one holds lands of another.
Bell.

## DISCLOSE

To bring into view by uncovering, to
lay bare, to reveal to knowledge, to free from
secrecy or ignorance, or make known. State v.
Krokston, 187 Mo.App. 67, 172 S.W. 1156, 1157.

## DISCLOSURE

Revelation; the impartation of
that which is secret. Commonwealth v. Chesa-
peake & 0. Ry. Co., 137 Va. 526, 120 S.E. 506, 509.
That which is disclosed or revealed. Webster,
Dict.
In patent law, the specification; the statement
of the subject-matter of the invention, or the
manner in which it operates. Westinghouse Elec-
tric & Mfg. Co. v. Metropolitan Electric Mfg. Co.,
C.C.A.N.Y., 290 F. 661, 664.
What any patentee has invented is theoretically what he
discloses, and the "disclosure" is the specification while
a "claim" is a definition of that which has been disclosed
in the specification; the disclosure telling how to do that
of which the claimant attempts definition. Westinghouse
Electric & Mfg. Co. v. Metropolitan Electric Mfg. Co., C.C.
A.N.Y., 290 F. 661, 664.

## DISCOMMON

To deprive commonable lands of
their commonable quality, by inclosing and ap-
propriating or improving them.
DISCONTINUANCE.
In Pleading
That technical interruption of the proceedings
in an action which follows where a defendant
does not answer the whole of the plaintiff's de-
claration, and the plaintiff omits to take judg-
ment for the part unanswered. Steph. Pl. 216,
In Practice
The termination of an action, in consequence
of the plaintiff's omitting to continue the process
or proceedings by proper entries on the record.
3 Bl.Comm. 296; 1 Tidd, Pr. 678; 2 Arch.Pr.K.B.
233. Hadwin v. Railway Co., 67 S.C. 463, 45 S.E.
In practice, a discontinuance is a chasm or gap left by
neglecting to enter a continuance. By our practice, a
neglect to enter a continuance, even in a defaulted action,
by no means puts an end to it, and such actions may al-
ways be brought forward. Taft v. Northern Transp. Co.,
56 N.H. 416; Porter v. Watkins, 196 Ala. 333, 71 So. 687,
The cessation of the proceedings in an action
where the plaintiff voluntarily puts an end to it,
either by giving notice in writing to the defendant
before any step has been taken in the action sub-
sequent to the answer, or at any other time by
order of the court or a judge; a non-suit; dis-
missal. Payne v. Buena Vista Extract Co., 124
Va. 296, 98 S.E. 34, 39.
In practice, discontinuance and dismissal import the same
thing, viz., that the cause is sent out of court. Thurman v.
James, 48 Mo. 235.
In Public Works
Refers to the termination or abandonment of
a project, structure, highway, or the like. Fulton
County v. Board of Hudson River Regulating Dist.,
248 N.Y.S. 8, 10, 231 App.Div. 408.
Ending, causing to cease, ceasing to use, giving
up, leaving off. Keenan v. Broad River Power
Co., 163 S.C. 133, 161 S.E. 330, 331.
In Zoning Ordinances
Synonymous with abandonment. State ex rel.
Schaetz v. Mander, 206 Wis. 121, 238 N.W. 835,
DISCONTINUANCE OF AN ESTATE. The ter-
mination or suspension of an estate-tail, in con-
sequence of the get of the tenant in tail, in con-
veying a larger estate in the land than he was by
law entitled to do. 2 Bl.Comm. 275; 3 Bl.Comm.
171. An alienation made or suffered by tenant
in tail, or by any that is seised in autre droit,
whereby the issue in tail, or the heir or successor,
or those in reversion or remainder, are driven to
their action, and cannot enter. Co. Litt. 325a.
The cesser of a seisin under an estate, and the
acquisition of a seisin under a new and necessarily
a wrongful title. Prest. Merg. c. ii.
Discontinuare nihil aliud significat quam inter-
mittere, desuescere, interrumpere. Co. Litt. 325.
To discontinue signifies nothing else than to in-
termit, to disuse, to interrupt.

## DISCONTINUANCE

Occasional; intermittent;
characterized by separate repeated acts; as, dis-
continuous easements and servitudes. See Ease-
ment.

## DISCONVENABLE

L. Fr. Improper; unfit.
Kelham.

## DISCOUNT

In a general sense, an allowance or
deduction made from a gross sum on any account
whatever. In a more limited and technical sense,
the taking of interest in advance. Cooper v. Na-
tional Bank of Savannah, 21 Ga.App. 356, 94 S.
E. 611, 614.
By the language of the commercial world and
the settled practice of banks, a discount by a bank
means a drawback or deduction made upon its ad-
vances or loans of money, upon negotiable paper
or other evidences of debt payable at a future
day, which are transferred to the bank. See, also,
Valley Mortg. Co. v. Patterson, 30 Ala.App. 492,
8 So.2d 213, 214.
Although the discounting of notes or bills, in its most
comprehensive sense, may mean lending money and taking
notes in payment, yet, in its more ordinary sense, the dis-
counting of notes or bills means advancing a consideration
for a bill or note, deducting or discounting the interest
which will accrue for the time the note has to run. In re
Worth Lighting & Fixture Co., D.C.N.Y., 292 F. 769, 772.
Discounting by a bank means lending money upon a
note, and deducting the interest or premium in advance.
Meserole Securities Co. v. Cosman, 253 N.Y. 130, 170 N.E.
519, 521.
Discount, as we have seen, is the difference between the
price and the amount of the debt, the evidence of which
is transferred. That difference represents interest charged,
being at the same rate, according to which the price paid,
if invested until the maturity of the debt, will just produce
its amount. Napier v. John V. Farwell Co., 60 Colo. 319,
153 P. 694, 695.

538, 45 A.L.R. 559.

## DISCRETELY

Separately; disjunctively. Parks
v. City of Des Moines, 195 Iowa, 972, 191 N.W. 728,
10 Coke, 140. Discretion is to know through law

Discretio est scire per legem quid sit justum. Dis-
cretion consists in knowing what is just in law.
Le Roy v. New York, 4 Johns. Ch. (N. Y.) 352,
DISCRETION. Power or privilege of the court
to act unhampered by legal rule. Osborn v. Unit-
ed States Bank, 9 Wheat. 866, 6 L.Ed. 204; Mur-
ray v. Buell, 74 Wis. 14, 41 N.W. 1010, 11 L.R.A.
When applied to public functionaries, discretion means a
power or right conferred upon them by law of acting
officially in certain circumstances, according to the dictates
of their own judgment and conscience, uncontrolled by the
judgment or conscience of others. This discretion un-
doubtedly is to some extent regulated by usage, or, if the
term is preferred, by fixed principles. But by this is to
be understood nothing more than that the same court can-
not, consistently with its own dignity, and with its char-
acter and duty of administering impartial justice, decide in
different ways two cases in every respect exactly alike.
The question of fact whether the two cases are alike in
every color, circumstance, and feature is of necessity to
be submitted to the judgment of some tribunal. State v.
Tindell, 112 Kan. 256, 210 P. 619, 622. Board of Permanent
Road Com'rs of Hunt County v. Johnson, Tex.Civ.App.,
231 S.W. 859, 860.
Judicial Discretion, Legal Discretion
These terms are applied to the discretionary action of a
judge or court, and mean discretion as above defined, that
is, discretion bounded by the rules and principles of law,
and not arbitrary, capricious, or unrestrained. "Judicial
discretion" is substantially synonymous with judicial pow-
er. Griffin v. State, 12 Ga.App. 615, 77 S.E. 1080, 1083.
It is not the indulgence of a judicial whim, but the ex-
ercise of judicial judgment, based on facts and guided by
law, Smith v. Hill, C.C.A., 5 F.2d 188, or the equitable
decision of what is just and proper under the circum-
stances, People v. Pfanschmidt, 262 Ill. 411, 104 N.E. 804,
816, Ann.Cas.1915A, 1171. It is simply the technical name
of the decision of certain questions of fact by the court.
Nawn v. Boston & M. R. R., 77 N.H. 299, 91 A. 181, 182.
Lord Coke defines judicial discretion to be "discernere
per legem quid sit justum," to see what would be just ac-
cording to the laws in the premises. It does not mean a
wild self-willfulness, which may prompt to any and every
act; but this judicial discretion is guided by the law, (see
what the law declares upon a certain statement of facts,
and then decide in accordance with the law,) so as to do
substantial equity and justice. Faber v. Bruner, 13 Mo.
543. It is a legal discretion to be exercised in discerning
the course prescribed by law 'and is not to give effect to
the. will of the judge, but to that of the law. McGurty v.
Delaware, L. & W. R. Co., 158 N.Y.S. 285, 286, 172 App.
Div. 46.
True, it is a matter of discretion; but then the discre-
tion is not willful or arbitrary, but legal. And, although
its exercise be not purely a matter of law, yet it "involves
a matter of law or legal inference," in the language of
the Code, and an appeal will lie. Lovinier v. Pearce, 70 N.
C. 171.
Legal discretion, is the exercise of discretion where there
are two alternative provisions of law applicable, under ei-
ther of which court could proceed. Shannon v. Hendrix-
son, Ohio App., 32 N.E.2d 431, 432.
In criminal law and the law of torts, it means
the capacity to distinguish between what is right
and wrong, lawful or unlawful, wise or foolish,
sufficiently to render one amenable and responsi-
ble for his acts. Towle v. State, 3 Fla. 214.
Wise conduct and management; cautious dis-
cernment, especially as to matters of propriety
ness. Arkansas Valley Town & Land Co. v. At-
chison, T. & S. F. Ry. Co., 49 Okl. 282, 151 P. 1028,
DISCRETIONARY DAMAGES. Those which are
measureable by enlightened conscience of impar-
tial jurors. Southern Ry. Co. v. Groover, 41 Ga.
App. 746, 154 S.E. 706, 707.

## DISCRETIONARY POWER

One which is not
imperative or, if imperative, the time, manner,
or extent of execution of which is left to donee's
discretion; the power to do or to refrain from
doing a certain thing. City of San Antonio v. Zog-
heib, Tex.Civ.App., 70 S.W.2d 333, 334.

## DISCRETIONARY TRUSTS

Such as are not
marked out on fixed lines, but allow a certain
amount of discretion in their exercise. Those
which cannot be duly administered without the
application of a certain degree of prudence and
judgment. Greenwich Trust Co. v. Tyson, 129
Conn. 211, 27 A.2d 166, 172.

## DISCRIMINATION

With reference to common
carriers (especially railroads), a breach of the
carrier's duty to treat all shippers alike, and af-
ford them equal opportunities to market their
product. Cox v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 240 Pa. 27,
87 A. 581, 583. A carrier's failure to treat all alike
under substantially similar conditions. Kentucky
Traction & Terminal Co. v. Murray, 176 Ky. 593,
195 S.W. 1119, 1120.
"Discrimination" is a term well understood in the nom-
enclature of transportation over railroads. It implies to
charge shippers of freight, as compensation for carrying
the same over railroads, unequal sums of money for the
same quantity of freight for equal distances; more for
shorter than a longer distance, more in proportion of dis-
tance for a shorter than a longer distance; more for
freights called local freights than those designated other-
wise; more for the former in proportion to distance such
freights may be carried than the latter. Atchison, T. & S.
F. Ry. Co. v. State, 85 Okl. 223, 206 P. 236, 239.
In constitutional law, the effect of a statute
which confers particular privileges on a class ar-
bitrarily selected from a large number of persons,
all of whom stand in the same relation to the
privileges granted and between whom and those
not favored no reasonable distinction can be
found. Franchise Motor Freight Ass'n v. Seavey,
196 Cal. 77, 235 P. 1000, 1002.
In general, a failure to treat all equally; fa-
voritism. Employment, Mische v. Kaminski, 127

the ground of race and color, Thomas v. Hibbitts,
D.C.Tenn., 46 F.Supp. 368, 371; taxation, Atlantic
Pipe Line Co. v. Brown County, D.C.Tex., 12 F.
Supp. 642, 647.
In the Civil Law
A proceeding, at the instance of a surety, by
which the creditor is obliged to exhaust the prop-
erty of the principal debtor, towards the satis-
faction of the debt, before having recourse to the
surety; and this right of the surety is termed the
"benefit of discussion."
In Scotch Law
The ranking of the proper order in which heirs
are liable to satisfy the debts of the deceased.

of America v. Nicholson, C.C.A.N.Y., 9 F.2d 7, 14;
Merriam v. Hamilton, 64 Or. 476, 130 P. 406, 407.
In construing a policy of life insurance, it is
generally true that, before any temporary ailment
can be called a "disease," it must be such as to
indicate a vice in the constitution, or be so serious
as to have some bearing upon general health and
the continuance of life, or such as, according to
common understanding, would be called a "dis-
ease." Delaney v. Modern Ace. Club, 121 Iowa
528, 97 N.W. 91, 63 L.R.A. 603; Metropolitan Casu-
alty Ins. Co. v. Cato, 113 Miss. 303, 74 So. 118, 119.

of employment and such disease or infection as may nat-
urally and unavoidably result therefrom. Pinto v. Chelsea

ed rights and immunities; to deprive of any fran-

Webster.
In any election where the party system furnishes the
means by which the citizen's right of suffrage is made ef-
fective, denial of his party's right to participate in the
election accomplishes the "disfranchisement of voters" or
political parties other than that to which they belong, and
the deprivation of the right of selection is a deprivation of
the right of franchise. Communist Party of United States
of America v. Peek, 20 Ca1.2d 536, 127 P.2d 889, 894.

## DISFRANCHISEMENT

sal from operating as .a bar to a subsequent suit.
Northrup v. Jay, 262 Mich. 463, 247 N.W. 717, 718.

## DISMISSED

A judgment of "Dismissed," with-
out qualifying words indicating a right to take
further proceedings, is presumed to be dismissed
on the merits; Durant v. Essex Co., 7 Wall. 107,
19 L.Ed. 154. But a bill "dismissed" on motion of
complainant does not bar a second suit; Ex parte
Loung June, D.C.N.Y., 160 F. 251, 259.

## DISMISSED FOR WANT OF EQUITY

A phrase
used to indicate a decision on the merits, as dis-
tinguished from one based upon some formal de-
fect. The dismissal may be because the aver-
ments of complainant's bill have been found un-
true in fact, or because they are insufficient to
entitle complainant to the relief sought. Rein-
man v. Little Rock, 35 S.Ct. 511, 513, 237 U.S. 171,

## DISSEISIN

Dispossession; a deprivation of pos-

right of seisin and possession, and an exercise of
such powers and privileges of ownership as to
keep out or displace him to whom these right-
fully belong. 3 Washb. Real Prop. 125; Sweeney
v. Dahl, 140 Me. 133, 34 A.2d 673, 675, 151 A.L.R.
It is a wrongful putting out of him that is seised
of the freehold, not, as in abatement or intrusion,
a wrongful entry, where the possession was va-
cant, but an attack upon him who is in actual
possession, and turning him out. It is an ouster
from a freehold in deed, as abatement and in-
trusion are ousters in law. 3 Steph.Comm. 386.
When one man invades the possession of another, and by
force or surprise turns him out of the occupation of his
lands, this is termed a "disseisin," being a deprivation of
that actual seisin or corporal possession of the freehold
which the tenant before enjoyed. In other words, a dissei-
sin is said .to be when one enters intending to usurp the
possession, and to oust another from the freehold. To con-
stitute an entry a disseisin, there must be an ouster of
the freehold, either by taking the profits or by claiming the
inheritance. Brown.
According to the modern authorities, there seems to be
no legal difference between the words "seisin" and "pos-
session," although there is a difference between the words
"disseisin" and "dispossession ;" the former meaning an
estate gained by wrong and injury, whereas the latter
may be by right or by wrong ; the former denoting an
ouster of the disseisee, or some act equivalent to it, where-
as by the latter no such act is implied. Slater v. Rawson,
6 Metc. (Mass.) 439.
Equitable disseisin is where a person is wrong-
fully deprived of the equitable seisin of land, e. g.,
of the rents and profits. 2 Meriv. 171; 2 Jac. &
W. 166.
Disseisin by election is where a person alleges
or admits himself to be disseised when he has not
really been so.
Disseisinam satis fa,cit, qui uti non permittit pos-
sessorem, vel minus commode, licet omnino non
expellat. Co. Litt. 331. He makes disseisin
enough who does not permit the- possessor to en-
joy, or makes his enjoyment less beneficial, al-
though he does not expel him altogether.

## DISSEISITRIX

ess. Fleta, lib. 4, c. 12, § 4.

## DISSENSUS

technically, an undoing of the consensus which

DISSENT. Contrariety of opinion; refusal to
agree with something already stated or adjudged
or to an act previously performed.
The term is most commonly used in American
law to denote the explicit disagreement of one or
more judges of a court with the decision passed
by the majority upon a case before them. In such
event, the non-concurring judge is reported as
"dissenting." Mere failure of a justice to vote is
not a dissent. Charles W. Sommer & Bro. v. Al-
bert Lorsch & Co., 254 N.Y. 146, 172 N.E. 271, 272.
A dissent may or may not be accompanied by an
opinion.

## DISSOLUTE

abandoned to sensual pleasures, profligate, wan-
ton, lewd, debauched, thus, evidence that defend-
ants danced in nude at a smoker authorized their
conviction as dissolute persons. People v. Scott,
113 Cal.App. 778, 296 P. 601, 603.
DISSOLUTION.
In Contracts
. The dissolution of a contract is the cancellation
or abrogation of it by the parties themselves, with
the effect of annulling the binding force of the
agreement, and restoring each party to his orig-
inal rights. In this sense it is frequently used in
the phrase "dissolution of a partnership." Willis-
ton v. Camp, 9 Mont. 88, 22 P. 501.
In Practice
The act of rendering a legal proceeding null,
abrogating or revoking it; unloosing its constrain-
ing force; as when an injunction is dissolved by
the court. Jones v. Hill, 6 N.C. 131.
Of Corporations
The dissolution of a corporation is the termina-
tion of its existence as a body politic. This may
take place in several ways; as by act of the legis-
lature, where that is constitutional; by surrender
or forfeiture of its charter; by expiration of its
charter by lapse of time; by proceedings for wind-
ing it up under the law; by loss of all its mem-
bers or their reduction below the statutory limit.

v. Jones, 170 Tenn. 217, 94 S.W.2d 47, 48.

## DISSOLUTION OF PARLIAMENT

may dissolve parliament either in person or by
proclamation; the dissolution is usually by pro-
clamation, after a prorogation. No parliament
may last for a longer period than seven years.
Septennial Act, 1 Geo. I. c. 38. Under 6 Anne, c.
37, upon a demise of the crown, parliament be-
came ipso facto dissolved six months afterwards,
but under the Reform Act, 1867, its continuance
is now nowise affected by such demise. May, Parl.
Pr. (6th Ed.) 48. Brown.

the work. Steph. Pl. (7th Ed.) 77d.

ments, but rather it is an increase in the number
of shares declared out of profits, the increased
number representing exactly the same property
as was represented by the smaller number of
shares. Booth v. Gross, Kelley & Co., 30 N.M.
465, 238 P. 829, 831, 41 A.L.R. 868. It is_ really

cal claims to supremacy in temporal as well as

Divine Right of Kings."
DIVINE SERVICE. Divine service was the name
of a feudal tenure, by which the tenants were
obliged to do some special divine services in cer-
tain; as to sing so many masses, to distribute
such a sum in alms, and the like. (2 Bl. Comm.
102; 1 Steph. Comm. 227.) It differed from tenure
in frankalmoign, in this: that, in case of the
tenure by divine service, the lord of whom the
lands were holden might distrain for its nonper-
formance, whereas, in case of frankalmoign, the
lord has no remedy by distraint for neglect of the
service, but merely a right of complaint to the
visitor to correct it. Mozley & Whitley.

## DO, DICO, ADDICO

Lat. I give, I say, I ad-
judge. Three words used in the Roman law, to
express the extent of the civil jurisdiction of

In this and the foregoing phrase, the conjunction "ut" is

consideration. In the Roman usage, this word imported
a modus, that is, a qualification; while a consideration
(causa) was more aptly expressed by the word "quia."

v. Bullock Tractor Co., D.C.Cal., 242 F. 543, 550;
Johnson v. Cass & Emerson, 91 Vt. 103, 99 A. 633,
635; or be of a systematic and regular nature;
Home Lumber Co. v. Hopkins, 107 Kan. 153, 190

Co., 96 N.J.Law, 218, 114 A. 756, 757; Anderson v.
Morris & E. R. Co., C.C.A.N.Y., 216 F. 83, 87. To
the contrary. Tripp State Bank of Tripp v. Jerke,
45 S.D. 448, 188 N.W. 314, 315.
No general definition can be made of phrase "doing busi-
ness" in statutes relating to foreign corporations. Each
case must be determined on its own facts, by considering
objective of statute in which phrase is found, its purpose
and orientation to the carrying on of business, nature of
activities, their magnitude, multiplicity of contracts, and
possibility that incidents may occur and liabilities be cre-
ated, especially where entrance into state is in ordinary
prosecution of corporation's business. State Highway and
Public Works Commission v. Diamond S. S. Transp. Corp.,
225 N. C. 198, 34 S.E.2d 78, 80, 81.
Ordinarily the phrase means engaging in activities in
pursuit of gain. Welch Holding Co. v. Galloway, 161 Or.
515, 89 P.2d 559; People v. Jones, 16 N.Y.S.2d 558, 559, 172

## DOLUS

In the civil law. Guile; deceitfulness;
malicious fraud. A fraudulent address or trick
used to deceive some one; a fraud. Dig. 4, 3, 1.
Any subtle contrivance by words or acts with a

2, 21.
Such acts or omissions as operate as a deception
upon the other party, or violate the just confidence
reposed by him, whether there be a deceitful in-
tent (malus animus) or not. Poth. Traitê de De-
pot, nn. 23, 27; Story, Bailm. § 20a; 2 Kent,
Comm. 506, note.
Fraud, willfulness, or intentionality. In that
use it is opposed to culpa, which is negligence
merely, in greater or less degree. The policy of
the law may sometimes treat extreme culpa as if
it were dolus, upon the maxim culpa dolo com-
paratur. A person is always liable for dolus pro-
ducing damage, but not always for culpa produc-
ing damage, even though extreme. Brown.
DOLUS AUCTORIS NON NOCET SUCCESSORI.
The fraud of a predecessor prejudices not his suc-
cessor.

## DOLUS BONUS, DOLUS MALUS

In a wide
sense, the Roman law distinguishes between
"good," or rather "permissible" dolus and "bad"
or fraudulent dolus. The former is justifiable or
allowable deceit; it is that which a man may em-
ploy in self-defense against an unlawful attack,
or for another permissible purpose, as when one
dissembles the truth to prevent a lunatic from
injuring himself or others. The latter exists
where one intentionally misleads another or takes
advantage of another's error wrongfully, by any
form of deception, fraud, or cheating. Mackeld.
Rom. Law, § 179; Broom, Max. 349; 2 Kent,
Comm. 560, note.

## DOLUS EST MACHINATIO, CUM ALIUD DIS- SIMULAT ALIUD AGIT

Lane, 47. Deceit is an
artifice, since it pretends one thing and does an-
other.
DOLUS ET FRAUS NEMINI PATROCINENTUR,
(PATROCINARI DEBENT.) Deceit and fraud
shall excuse or benefit no man. Yearb. 14 Hen.

cerum or Domo Procerum; the house of lords

## DOMAIN

The complete and absolute ownership
,of land; a paramount and individual right of
property in land. People v. Shearer, 30 Cal. 658.
Also the real estate so owned. The inherent sov-
ereign power claimed by the legislature of a
state, of controlling private property for public
uses, is termed the "right of eminent domain."
2 Kent, Comm. 339. See Eminent Domain.
A distinction has been made between "property" and
"domain." The former is said to be that quality which is
conceived to be in the thing itself, considered as belonging
to such or such person, exclusively of all others. By the
latter is understood that right which the owner has of dis-
posing of the thing. Hence "domain" and "property" are
said to be correlative terms. The one is the active right
to dispose of ; the other a passive quality which follows
the thing and places it at the disposition of the owner. 3
Toullier, no. 83.
National domain is sometimes applied to the
aggregate of the property owned directly by a
nation. Civ. Code La. art. 486. Public domain
embraces all lands, the title to which is in the
United States, including as well land occupied
_for the purposes of federal buildings, arsenals,
dock-yards, etc., as land of an agricultural or
mineral character not yet granted to private own-
ers. Day Land & Cattle Co. v. State, 68 Tex. 526,
,4 S.W. 865.

## DOMBEC, DOMBOC

ors, and the forms of judicial proceedings. It is
said to have been extant so late as the reign of
Edward IV., but is now lost. 1 Bl.Comm. 64, 65.

## DOMESDAY, DOMESDAY-BOOK

lands in England. 2 Bl.Comm. 49, 50. The work
was begun by five justices in each county in 1081,
and finished in 1086.

## DOMESMEN

(Sax.) An inferior kind of judges.
Men appointed to doom (judge) in matters in con-
troversy. Cowell. Suitors in a court of a manor

## DOMESTIC

A domestic, or, in full, domestic
servant, is a servant who resides in the same

to workmen or laborers employed out of doors.
Ex parte Meason, 5 Bin. (Pa.) 167; Richardson v.
State, 43 Tex. 456; Anderson v. Ueland, 197 Minn.
518, 267 N.W. 517, 518.
The Louisiana Civil Code enumerates as domestics those
who receive wages and stay in the house of the person
paying and employing them, for his own service or that of
his family ; such as valets, footmen, cooks, butlers, and
others who reside in the house. Persons employed in pub-
lic houses are not included. Cook v. Dodge, 6 La.Ann. 276.
The term is sometimes extended, however, to include
servants who do not reside in the same house as the master.

132 N.J.L. 213, 38 A.2d 862, 864; In re Stabile, 348
Pa. 587, 36 A.2d 451, 458; Shreveport Long Leaf
Lumber Co. v. Wilson, D.C.La., 38 F.Supp. 629, 631,
632. Not for a mere special or temporary pur-
se, but with the present intention of making a
permanent home, for an unlimited or indefinite
period. In re Garneau, 127 F. 677, 62 C.C.A. 403;
In re Gilbert's Estate, 15 A.2d 111, 117, 118, 18 N.J.
Misc. 540; In re Schultz' Estate, 316 Ill.App. 540,
45 N.E.2d 577, 582. Davis v. Davis, Ohio App., 57
N.E.2d 703, 704.
In international law, a residence at a particu-

town, 32 N.J.Law, 192; Graham v. Graham, 81 N.
W. 44, 9 N.D. 88; Phillimore, Int. Law 49.
The word "domicile" is derived from latin "domus",
meaning home or dwelling house, and domicile is legal
conception of "home". In re Schultz' Estate, 316 Ill.App.
45 N.E.2d 577, 582, 316 Ill.App. 540.
The established, fixed, permanent, or ordinary dwelling-
place or place of residence of a person, as distinguished
from his temporary and transient, though actual, place of
residence. It is his legal residence, as distinguished from
his temporary place of abode; or his home, as distin-
guished from a place to which business or pleasure may
temporarily call him. Towson v. Towson, 126 Va. 640, 102
S.E. 48, 52.
"Citizenship," "habitancy," and "residence" are several-
ly words which in the particular case may mean precisely
the same as domicile. Baker v. Keck, D.C.Ill., 13 F.Supp.
487. Earley v. Hershey Transit Co., D.C.Pa., 55 F.Supp.
981, 982; Dodd v. Lorenz, 210 Iowa 513, 231 N.W. 422,

"Domicile" and "residence," however, are frequently
distinguished, in that domicile is the home, the fixed place
of habitation; while residence is a transient place of dwell-
ing. Fisher v. Jordan, C.C.A.Tex., 116 F.2d 183, 186;
Minick v. Minick, 111 Fla. 469, 149 So. 483, 488; Hartzler
v. Radeka, 265 Mich. 451, 251 N.W. 554.
Domicile may be deemed to be of three sorts,—domicile
by birth, domicile by choice, and domicile by operation of
law. The first is the common case of the place of birth,
domicilium originis; the second is that which is voluntari-
ly acquired by a party, proprio motu; the last is conse-
quential, as that of the wife arising from marriage. Story,
Confl. Laws, § 46. And see Railroad Co. v. Kirnbrough, 115
Ky. 512, 74 S.W. 229; Johnson v. Harvey, 261 Ky. 522, 88
S.W.2d 42, 46, 47.

Wheat. 76, 4 L.Ed. 189.
In French law, permanent and fixed residence
in France of an alien who has not acquired French
citizenship nor taken steps to do so, but who in-
tends to make his home permanently or indefinite-
ly in that country; called domicile "de facto'r
because domicile in the full sense of that term, as
used in France, can only be acquired by an act
equivalent to naturalization. In re Cruger's Will,
36 Misc. 477, 73 N.Y.S. 812.
Domestic Domicile
A name sometimes used for "municipal domi-
cile" (q. v.). Hayward v. Hayward, 65 Ind.App.
440, 115 N.E. 966, 970.
Domicile of Choice
The essentials of "domicile" of choice are the
fact of physical presence at a dwelling place and
the intention to make that place home. New York
Trust Co. v. Riley, Del., 16 A.2d 772, 776, 783, 785;
In re Eisenberg's Estate, 31 N.Y.S.2d 380, 384, 385,
386, 177 Misc. 655; Prince v. New York Life Ins.
Co., D.C.Mass., 24 F.Supp. 41, 42.

charged. Fisher & Van Gilder v. First Trust
Joint-Stock Land Bank, 210 Iowa 531, 231 N.W.
671, 672, 69 A.L.R. 1340.
Domicile of Origin
The home of the parents. Phillim. Dom. 25,
101. That which arises from a man's birth and
connections. 5 Ves. 750. The domicile of the
parents at the time of birth, or what is termed
the "domicile of origin," constitutes the domicile
of an infant, and continues until abandoned, or
until the acquisition of a new domicile in a dif-
ferent place. Struble v. Struble, Tex.Civ.App., 177
S.W.2d 279, 283.
Domicile of Succession
As distinguished from a commercial, political,
or forensic domicile, the actual residence of a per-
son within some jurisdiction, of such a character
as shall, according to the well-established prin-
ciples of public law, give direction to the succes-
sion of his personal estate. Smith v, Croom, 7 Fla.
Elected Domicile

Municipal Domicile
One which as distinguished from "national dom-
icile" and "quasi national domicile" (see those
titles, infra), has reference to residence in a coun-
ty, township, or municipality. Hayward v. Hay-
ward, 65 Ind.App. 440, 115 N.E. 966, 970.
National Domicile
The domicile of a person, considered as being
within the territory of a particular nation, and
not with reference to a particular locality or sub-
division of a nation.
Natural Domicile
The same as domicile of origin or domicile by
birth. Johnson v. Twenty-One Bales, 13 Fed.Cas.
Necessary Domicile

of law, as distinguished from voluntary domicile
or domicile of choice. Phillim. Dom. 27-97.

Its literal translation, "gift," has acquired in real law a
more limited meaning, being applied to the conveyance of
estates tail. 2 Bl.Comm. 316; Littleton, § 59; West,
Symb. § 254; 4 Cruise, Dig. 51.
By the civil law (adopted into the English and American
law) donations are either inter vivos (between living per-
sons) or mortis causa (in anticipation of death.) As to
these forms, see infra. A donatio or gift as between living
persons is called donatio mera or pura when it is a simple
gift without compulsion or consideration, that is, resting
solely on the generosity of the donor, as in the case of
most charitable gifts. It is called donatio remuneratoria
when given as a reward for past services, but still not un-
der any legal compulsion, as in the case of pensions and
land-grants. It is called donatio sub modo (or modalis)
when given for the attainment of some special object or
on condition that the donee shall do something not specially
ment of hospitals, colleges, etc., coupled with the condition
that they shall be established and maintained. Mackeld.
Rom.Law, § 466; Fisk v. Flores, 43 Tex. 340; Noe v. Card,

to another. 2 Kent, Comm. 438; 2 Steph.Comm.
102. A term derived from the civil law. Inst. 2,
7, 2. A donation inter vivos (between living per-
sons) is an act by which the donor divests himself
at present and irrevocably of the thing given in
favor of the donee who accepts it. Succession
of Brand, 162 La. 880, 111 So. 267, 268.
There are three kinds of "donations inter vivos", namely,
"gratuitous donations", "onerous donations", and "re-
munerative donations", the first being based on mere lib-
erality, the second being burdened with charges imposed
by the donee, and the third being recompense for services
rendered. White v. White, La.App., 7 So.2d 255, 257.

## DONATIO MORTIS CAUSA

solution near, delivers, oar causes to be delivered,

2 Bl.Comm. 514. The civil law defines it to be
a gift under apprehension of death; as when any-
thing is given upon condition that, if the donor
dies, the donee shall possess it absolutely, or re-
turn it if the donor should survive or should re-
pent of having made the gift, or if the donee
should die before the donor. Adams v. Nicholas,
1 Miles (Pa.) 109-117. A gift in view of death is
one which is made in contemplation, fear, or peril
of death, and with intent that it shall take effect
only in case of the death of the giver. Prender-
gast v. Drew, 103 Conn. 88, 130 A. 75, 76. A do-
nation mortis causa (in prospect of death) is an
act to take effect when the donor shall no longer
exist, by which he disposes of the whole or a part
of his property, and which is revocable.

## DONATIO NON PRIESUMITUR

propter nuptias." Mackeld.Rom.Law, § 572.

eration whatever. International & G. N. Ry. Co. v. Ander-
son County, Tex.Civ.App., 174 S.W. 305, 315.
A donation of real estate is certainly not a mortgage or
privilege, but is a transfer of property of a peculiar kind,

A writ which lies
for a widow to whom no dower has been assigned.
3 Bl.Comm. 182. By 23 & 24 Vict. c. 126, an ordi-
nary action commenced by writ of summons has

United States, and under the designation of "dow-
er unde nihil habet" (see that title), I is the form
in common use for the recovery of dower at law.

A grievance made known
by a clerk or other person, to the archbishop of
the province, against the ordinary, for delaying or
refusing to do justice in some cause ecclesiastical,
as to give sentence, institute a clerk, etc. It is
termed a "double complaint," because it is most
commonly made against both the judge and him
at whose suit justice is denied or delayed; the
effect whereof is that the archbishop, taking no-
tice of the delay, directs his letters, under his au.-
thentical seal, to all clerks of his province, com-
manding them to admonish the ordinary, within
a certain number of days, to do the justice re-
quired, or otherwise to appear before him or his
official, and there allege the ca use of his delay;
perform the thing enjoined, nor appear nor show
cause against it, he himself, in his court of
audience, will forthwith proceed to do the jus-
tice that is due. Cowell.

tax and a school tax), nor the taxation of the
same piece of property to different persons when
they hold different interests in it or when it re-
presents different values in their hands, as when
both the mortgagor and mortgagee of property
are taxed in respect to their interests in it, or
when a tax is laid upon the capital or property
of a corporation and also upon the value of its
shares of stock in the hands of the separate stock-
holders. Cook v. Burlington, 59 Iowa, 251, 13 N.

a principle or process, previously known and ap-
plied, to some new use, but which does not lead to

## DOUBLE VALUE

In English law. This is a
penalty on a tenant holding over after his land-
lord's notice to quit. By 4 Geo. II. c. 28, § 1, it is
enacted that if any tenant for life or years hold
over any lands, etc., after the determination of
his estate, after demand made, and notice in writ-
ing given, for delivering the possession thereof,
by the landlord, or the person having the rever-
sion or remainder therein, or his agent thereunto
lawfully authorized, such tenant so holding over
shall pay to the person so kept out of possession
at the rate of double the yearly value of the
lands, etc., so detained, for so long a time as the
same are detained. See Woodf. Landl. & Ten.
(12th Ed.) 717, et seq.

## DOUBLE VOUCHER

This was when a common
recovery was had, and an estate of freehold was
first conveyed to any indifferent person against
whom the prcecipe was brought, and then he
vouched the tenant in tail, who vouched over the
common vouchee. For, if a recovery were had
immediately against a tenant in tail, it barred
only the estate in the premises of which he was
then actually seised, whereas, if the recovery
were had against another person, and the tenant
in tail were vouchee, it barred every latent right
and interest which he might have in the lands
recovered. 2 Bl.Comm. 359.

## DOUBLE WASTE

When a tenant bound to re-
pair suffers a house to be wasted, and then un-
lawfully fells timber to repair it, he is said to
commit double waste. Co. Litt. 53.

## DOUBT

Uncertainty of mind; the absence

of mind towards the acceptance of or belief in
a proposition, theory, or statement, in which the
judgment is not at rest but inclines alternately
to either side. Rowe v. Baber, 93 Ala. 422, 8 So.
865; Smith v. Railway Co., 143 Mo. 33, 44 S.W.
718; West Jersey Traction Co. v. Camden Horse
R. Co., 52 N.J.Eq. 452, 29 A. 333. An equipoise of
the mind arising from an equality of contrary
reasons. Ayliffe, Pand. 121.
Reasonable Doubt
This is a term often used, probably pretty well
understood, but not easily defined. It does not
mean a mere possible doubt, because everything
relating to human affairs, and depending on moral
evidence, is open to some possible or imaginary
doubt. It is that state of the case which, after
the entire comparison and consideration of all the
evidence, leaves the minds of jurors in that con-
dition that they cannot say they feel an abiding
conviction to a moral certainty of the truth of
the charge. If upon proof there is reasonable
doubt remaining, the accused is entitled to the
benefit of it by an acquittal; for it is not suffi-
cient to establish a probability, though a strong
one, arising from the doctrine of chances, that
the fact charged is more likely to be true than
the contrary, but the evidence must establish the
truth of the fact to a reasonable and moral cer-
tainty,—a certainty that convinces and directs
the understanding and satisfies the reason and
judgment of those who are bound to act con-
scientiously upon it. This is proof beyond rea-
sonable doubt; because if the law, which mostly
depends upon considerations of a moral nature,
should go further than this, and require absolute
certainty, it would exclude circumstantial evi-
dence altogether. Egan v. U. S., 52 App.D.C. 384,
287 F. 958.
Proof "beyond a reasonable doubt" is not be-
yond all possible or imaginary doubt, but such
proof as precludes every reasonable hypothesis
except that which it tends to support. It is proof
"to a moral certainty,"—such proof as satisfies
the judgment and consciences of the jury, as
reasonable men, and applying their reason to the
evidence before them, that the crime charged has
been committed by the defendant, and so satisfies
them as to leave no other reasonable conclusion
possible. State v. Koski, 100 W.Va. 98, 130 S.E.
100, 101.
The difficulty of a satisfactory definition is discussed in
57 Am.L.Reg. 419, where C. J. Shaw's definition is criti-
cized and that in Corn. v. Costley, 118 Mass. 1, supra, is
suggested as better. And in Hopt v. Utah, 120 U.S. 430,
7 S.Ct. 614, 30 L.Ed. 708, it was approved as contrasted
with C. J. Shaw's definition.
A "reasonable doubt" is such a doubt as would
cause a reasonable and prudent man in the grav-
er and more important affairs of life to pause and
hesitate to act upon the truth of the matter charg-
ed. But a reasonable doubt is not a mere possi-
bility of innocence, nor a caprice, shadow, or
speculation as to innocence not arising out of the
evidence or the want of it. State v. Perkins, 21
N.M. 135, 153 P. 258, 259.
A "reasonable doubt" is such a doubt as an upright man
might entertain in an honest investigation after truth.
Peterson v. State, 47 Ga. 524(5); Lochamy v. State, 152
Ga. 235, 109 S.E. 497.
A "reasonable doubt" is one for which a reason can be
given. State v. Jefferson, 43 La.Ann. 995, 10 So. 199.
Contra: Abbott v. Territory, 20 Okl. 119, 94 P. 179, 16 L.
R. A. ,N. S. , 260, 129 Am. St. Rep. 818.
The term needs no definition. People v. Rogers, 324 Ill.
224, 154 N.E. 909, 913.

## DOUBTFUL PAPER

"Slow" paper and "doubt-
ful paper" are not synonymous. American Nat.
Bank of Portsmouth v. Ames, 169 Va. 711, 194
S.E. 784, 793.

## DOUBTFUL TITLE

One as to the validity of
which there exists some doubt, either as to mat-
ter of fact or of law; one which invites or ex-
poses the party holding it to litigation. Barrett
v. McMannis, 153 Kan. 420, 110 P.2d 774, 778;
Black v. American International Corporation, 264
Pa. 260, 107 A. 737, 739. Distinguished from a
"marketable" title, which is of such a character
that the courts will compel its acceptance by a
purchaser who has agreed to buy the property or
has bid it in at public sale. Herman v. Somers,
(158 Pa. 424, 27 A. 1050, 38 Am.St.Rep. 851.

## DOUN, L

Fr. A gift. Otherwise written "don"
and "done." The thirty-fourth chapter of Britton
is entitled "De Douns."
DOVE. Doves are animals ferce naturce, and not

er's custody. Corn. v. Chace, 9 Pick., Mass. 15, 19
Am.Dec. 348; Ruckman v. Outwater, 28 N.J.Law
DOVETAIL. A structure in the form of a tenon
having oppositely-flared edges similar in shape to
the tail of a bird. Cheney Co. v. Cunningham,
D.C.Pa., 37 F.Supp. 224, 226.

## DOWABLE

Subject to be charged with dower;
as dowable lands.
Entitled or entitling to dower. Thus, a dowable
interest in lands is such as entitles the owner to
have such lands charged with dower.

## DOWAGER

A widow who is endowed, or who
has a jointure in lieu of dower. In England, this
is a title or addition given to the widows of
princes, dukes, earls, and other noblemen, to dis-
tinguish them from the wives of the heirs, who
have right to bear the title. 1 Bl.Comm. 224.
DOWAGER—QUEEN. The widow of the king.
As such she enjoys most of the privileges belong-
ing to her as queen consort. It is not treason to
conspire her death or violate her chastity, be-
cause the succession to the crown is not thereby
endangered. No man, however, can marry her
without a special license from the sovereign, on
pain of forfeiting his lands or goods. 1 Bl.Comm.

## DOWER

The provision which the law makes
for a widow out of the lands or tenements of her
husband, for her support and the nurture of her
children. Co. Litt. 30a; 2 Bl.Comm. 130; In re
Miller's Estate, 44 N.M. 214, 100 P.2d 908, 911. A
species of life-estate which a woman is, by law,
entitled to claim on the death of her husband, in
the lands and tenements of which he was seised
in fee during the marriage, and which her issue,
if any, might by possibility have inherited. 1
Steph.Comm. 249; 2 Bl.Comm. 129; Cruise, Dig.
tit. 6; 2 Crabb, Real Prop. p. 124, § 1117; 4 Kent,
Comm. 35. See Inchoate Dower.
"Dower" is the life estate to which every married woman
is entitled on death of her husband, intestate, or, in case
she dissents from his will, one-third in value of all lands
of which husband was beneficially seized in law or in fact.
at any time during coverture. McGehee v. McGehee, 189 N.
C. 558, 127 S.E. 684, 687. McLawhorn v. Smith, 211 N.C.
513, 191 S.E. 35, 38, 110 A.L.R. 980.
The term, both technically and in popular ac-
ceptation, has reference to real estate exclusive-
ly. Shackelford v. Shackelford, 181 Va. 869, 27
S.E.2d 354, 359.
"Dower," in modern use, is distinguished from "dowry."
The former is a provision for a widow on her husband's
death ; the latter is a bride's portion on her marriage.
Wendler v. Lambeth, 163 Mo. 428, 63 S.W. 684.

## DOWER AD OSTIUM ECCLESLE

Dower at
the church door or porch. An ancient kind of
dower in England, where a man, (being tenant in
fee-simple, of full age,) openly at the church door,
where all marriages were formerly celebrated,
after affiance made and troth plighted between
them, endowed his wife with the whole of his
lands, or such quantity as he pleased, at the same
time specifying and ascertaining the same. Litt.
§ 39; 2 Bl.Comm. 133.

## DOWER BY COMMON LAW

The ordinary kind
of dower in English and American law, consisting
of a life interest in one-third of the lands of which
the husband was seised in fee at any time during

Steph.Comm. 302; 4 Kent, Comm. 35.

## DOWER BY CUSTOM

A kind of dower in Eng-
land, regulated by custom, where the quantity
allowed the wife differed from the proportion of
the common law; as that the wife should have
half the husband's lands; or, in some places, the
whole; and, in some, only a quarter. 2 Bl.Comm.
132; Litt. § 37.

## DOWER DE LA PLUS BELLE (DE LA PLUIS BEALE)

L. Fr. Dower of the fairest [part.]
A species of ancient English dower, incident to
the old tenures, where there was a guardian in
chivalry, and the wife occupied lands of the heir
as guardian in socage. If the wife brought a
writ of dower against such guardian in chivalry,
he might show this matter, and pray that the

## DOWRESS

A woman entitled to dower; a ten-
ant in dower. 2 P.Wms. 707.

## DOWRY

The property which a woman brings
to her husband in marriage; now more common-
ly called a "portion."
This word expresses the proper meaning of the "dos" of
the Roman, the "dot" of the French, and the "dote" of the
Spanish, law, but is a very different thing from "dower,"
with which it has sometimes been confounded. See Co.Litt.
31; Dig. 23, 3, 76; Code 5, 12, 20; Buard v. De Russy, 6
Rob., La., 111; Gates v. Legendre, 10 Rob., La., 74; Cut-

enjoyed by him so long as the marriage shall
last, and the income of it belongs to him. He
alone has the administration of it during mar-
riage, and his wife cannot deprive him of it. The
real estate settled as dowry is inalienable during
marriage, unless the marriage contract contains
a stipulation to the contrary. De Young v. De
Young, 6 La.Ann. 786.

## DOYLE RULE

multiply the result by the length of the log in
feet. Morrison v. Pickrell Walnut Co., 199 Ill.
App. 175, 176.

## DOZE

DR. An abbreviation for "doctor;" also, in com-
mercial usage, for "debtor," indicating the items
or particulars in a bill or in an account-book

or dregs. In weighing commodities the term sig-
nifies dust and dirt, and not what is generally
meant by "draught" or "draft" (q. v.). 28 C.J.S.
p. 227.

## DRAFT

The common term for a bill of ex-
change; as being drawn by one person on an-
other. Hinnemann v. Rosenback, 39 N.Y. 100;
Ennis v. Coshocton Nat. Bank, 27 Ga.App. 479,
108 S.E. 811.
An order for the payment of money drawn
by one person on another. It is said to be a no-
men generalissimum, and to include all such or-
ders. Wilson v. Buchenau, D.C.Cal., 43 F.Supp.
272, 275.
The term includes a cashier's check, People v. Miller, 278
Ill. 490, 116 N.E. 131, 138 L.R.A.1917E, 797; Advance-Rum-
ely Thresher Co. v. Hess, 85 Mont. 293, 279 P. 236, 237;
but a draft is distinguishable from a cashier's check in,

The principle asserted by
Luis Drago, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the
Argentine Republic, in a letter to the Argentine
the forcible intervention of states to secure the
payment of public debts due to their citizens from
foreign states is unjustifiable and dangerous to
the security and peace of the nations of South
America. The subject was brought before the
Conference by the United States and a Conven-
tion was adopted in which the contracting pow-
ers agreed, with some restrictive conditions, not
to have recourse to armed force for the recov-
ery of contract debts claimed by their nationals
against a foreign state. Higgins, 184-197. See
Calvo Doctrine.

## DROIT

In French law. Right, justice, equity,
law, the whole body of law; also a right. Toullier,
n. 96; Pothier, Droit.
This term exhibits the same ambiguity which is discov-
erable in the German equivalent, "recht" and the English
word "right." On the one hand, these terms answer to the
Roman "jus," and thus indicate law in the abstract, con-
sidered as the foundation of all rights, or the complex of
underlying moral principles which impart the character of
justice to all positive law, or give it an ethical content.
Taken in this abstract sense, the terms may be adjectives,
which case they may be paraphrased by the expressions
"justice," "morality," or "equity." On the other hand,
they serve to point out a right; that is, a power, privilege,
faculty, or demand, inherent in one person, and incident
upon another. In the latter signification, droit (or recht or
right) is the correlative of "duty" or "obligation." In the
former sense, it may be considered as opposed to wrong,.
injustice, or the absence of law. Droit has the further
ambiguity that it is sometimes used to denote the existing
body of law considered as one whole, or the sum total of
a number of individual laws taken together. See Jus;
Recht; Right.
In old English law. Law; right; a writ of
right. Co.Litt. 158b.
A person was said to have droit droit, plurimum June,
and plurimum possessionis, when he had the freehold, the
fee, and the property in him. Crabb, Hist.E.L. 406.
—Autre droit. The right of another.

## DROITS CIVILS

This phrase in French law de-
notes private rights, the exercise of which is in-
dependent of the status (qualite) of citizen. For-
eigners enjoy them; and the extent of that en-
joyment is determined by the principle of reci-
prodty. Conversely, foreigners may be sued on
contracts made by them in France. Brown.
DROIT—CLOSE. An ancient writ, directed to the
lord of ancient demesne on behalf of those of his
tenants who held their lands and tenements by
charter in fee-simple, in fee-tail, for life, or in
dower. Fitzh.Nat.Brev. 23.

## DROIT D'EXECUTION

The right of a stockbro-
ker to sell the securities bought by him for ac-
count of a client, if the latter does not accept de-
livery thereof. The same expression is also ap-
plied to the sale by a stockbroker of securities de-
posited with him by his client, in order to guaranty
the payment of operations for which the latter has
given instructions. Arg.Fr.Merc.Law, 557.
the lords of the roasts of certain parts of France,
to shipwrecks, by which not only the property, but
the persons of those who were cast away, were
confiscated for the prince who was lord of the
coast. Otherwise called "droit de bris sur le nau-
frage." This right prevailed chiefly in Bretagne,

rolls at Bordeaux.

## DROIT-DROIT

A double right; that is, the right

currence was necessary to constitute a complete
title to land. Mozley & Whitley.

says in Anglo-Amer.Leg.Hist. 318; 15 L.Q.R. 359;
Marsden, Admiralty, Droits and Salvage; 1 W.
Rob. 423. In England, it has been usual in mari-
time wars for the government to seize and con-
demn, as droits of admiralty, the property of an
enemy found in her ports at the breaking out of
hostilities. 1 C.Rob. 196; 13 Ves. 71; 1 Edw. 60;

usual to make an order in one way, the junior
judge withdrawing his judgment. Wharton.

fumers v. State, 212 Ind. 455, 7 N.E.2d 970, 972.

## DRUGGIST

A dealer in drugs; one whose busi-
ness is to sell drugs and medicines. In strict us-
age, this term is to be distinguished from "apothe-
cary." A druggist deals in the uncompounded
medicinal substances; the business of an apothe-
cary is to mix and compound them. But in Ameri-
ca the two words are used interchangeably, as the
same persons usually discharge both functions.
State v. Donaldson, 41 Minn. 74, 42 N.W. 781.

## DRUNK

A person is "drunk" when he is so far
'
under the influence of liquor that his passions are
visibly excited or his judgment impaired, or wilen
his brain is so far affected by potations of liquor
that his intelligence, sense-perceptions, judgmert,
continuity of thought or of ideas, speech,, and ,co-
ordination of volition with muscular action (pr
some of these faculties or processes) are impaired
or not under normal control. Wilson V. Inter-
Ocean Casualty Co., 210 N.C. 585, 188 S.E. 102, 106.
It is a synonym of intoxicated. Gault v. State, 42
Okl.Cr. 89, 274 P. 687, 688.

## DRUNKARD

He is a drunkard whose habit it is
to get drunk; whose ebriety has become habitual.

705, 19 A. 142. Pollon v. State, 218' Wis. 466, 261
N.W. 224, 225.
A "common" drunkard is defined by statute in some
states as a person who has been convicted of drunkenness
(or proved to have been drunk) a certain number of times
within a limited period. State v. Flynn, 16 R.I. 10, 11 A.
170. Elsewhere the word "common" in this connection is
understood as being equivalent to "habitual," Com. v.
McNamee, 112 Mass. 286; or perhaps as synonymous with
"public," Com. v. Whitney, 5 Gray, Mass., 86.

## DRUNKENNESS

In medical jurisprudence. The
condition of a man whose mind is affected by the
immediate use of intoxicating drinks; the state
of one who is "drunk." Mutual Life Ins. Co. v.
Johnson, 64 Okl. 222, 166 P. 1074, 1076. 'The ef-
fect produced upon the mind or body by drinking
intoxicating liquors to such an extent that the
normal condition of the subject is changed and his
capacity for rational action and conduct is sub-
stantially lessened. Lecates v. Lecates, Del.Super.,
190 A. 294, 296. See Drunk.
DRY, adj. In the vernacular, this term means
desiccated or free from moisture; but, In legal
use, it signifies formal or nominal, without impos-
ing any duty or responsibility, or unfruitful, with-
out bringing any profit or advantage.

Watertight oasin, which allows
examination and work on bottom of vessel after
pumping out. Maryland Casualty Co. v. La'wson,
C.C.A.Fla., 101 F.2d 732, 733. Whatever may have
been the definition of a "dry dock" in the past,
the definition must be enlarged to include modern
facilities for repairing boats out of the water, as
the meaning of the term, used in its common,
ordinary sense, is a dry place to work in. Con-
tinental Casualty Co. v. Lawson, D.C.Fla., 2 F.
Supp. 459, 460.

## DRY EXCHANGE

In English law. A term for-
merly in use, said to have been invented for the

thing being pretended to pass on both sides,
whereas, in truth, nothing passed but on one side,
in which respect it was called "dry." Cowell;
Blount.

## DRY ICE

135, 142.

## DRY WEIGHT

In tariff laws, this term does not
mean the weight of an article after desiccation in
a kiln, but its air-dry weight as understood in com-
merce. U. S. v. Perkins, 66 F. 50, 13 C.C.A. 324.

## DUAL BUSINESS

## DUCES TECUM

(Lat. Bring with you.) The
name of certain species of %Nwrits, of which the
subpcena duces tecum is the most usual, requiring
a party who is summoned to appear in court to
bring with him some document, piece of evidence,
or other thing to be used or inspected by the court.

## DUCES TECUM LICET LANGUIDUS

(Bring
with you, although sick.) In practice. An ancient
writ, now obsolete, directed to the sheriff, upon a
return that he could not bring his prisoner with-
out danger of death, he being adeo languidus, (so
sick;) whereupon the court granted a habeas cor-
pus in the nature of a duces tecum licet languidus.
Cowell; Blount.

## DUCHY OF LANCASTER

Those lands which
formerly belonged to the dukes of Lancaster, and
now belong to the crown in right of the duchy.
The duchy is distinct from the county palatine of
Lancaster, and includes not only the county, but
also much territory at a distance from it, especi-
ally the Savoy in London and some land near
Westminster. 3 Bl.Comm. 78.

## DUCHY COURT OF LANCASTER

A tribunal
of special jurisdiction, held before the chancellor
of the duchy, or his deputy, concerning all matters
of equity relating to lands holden of the crown in
right of the duchy of Lancaster; which is a thing
very distinct from the county palatine, (which
has also its separate chancery, for sealing of writs,
and the like,) and comprises much territory which
lies at a vast distance from it; as particularly a
very large district surrounded by the city of West-
minster. The proceedings in this court are the
same as were those on the equity side of the court
of chancery, so that it seems not to be a court
of record; and, indeed, it has been holden that
the court of chancery has a concurrent jurisdic-
tion with the duchy court, and may take cogniz-
ance of the same causes. Jud.Act 1873, § 18; 3
Bl.Comm. 78.
DUCKING–STOOL. See Castigatory.

## DUCROIRE

In French law. Guaranty; equiv-
alent to del credere, (which see.)
DUE. Just; proper; regular; lawful; suffi-
cient; remaining unpaid; reasonable; as in the
phrases "due care," "due process of law," "due
notice."
Owing; payable; justly owed. That which one
contracts to pay or perform to another; that
which law or justice requires to be paid or done.
Owed, or owing, as distinguished from payable.
A debt is often said to be due from a person where
he is the party owing it, or primarily bound to pay,
whether the time for payment has or has not ar-
rived. The same thing is true of the phrase "due
and owing."
Payable. A bill or note is commonly said to be
due when the time for payment of it has arrived.
Final is not synonymous with due. Twine v.
Locke, D.C.N.Y., 3 F.Supp. 1012, 1013.
The word "due" always imports a fixed and settled
obligation or liability, but with reference to the time for
its payment there is considerable ambiguity in the use of
the term, as will appear from the foregoing definitions, the
precise signification being determined in each case from the
context. It may mean that the debt or claim in question
is now (presently or immediately) matured and enforce-
able, or that it matured at some time in the past and yet
remains unsatisfied, or that it is fixed and certain but the
day appointed for its payment has not yet arrived. But
commonly, and in the absence of any qualifying expres-
sions, the word "due" is restricted to the first of these
meanings, the second being expressed by the term "over-
due," and the third by the word "payable." See Feeser v.
Feeser, 93 Md. 716, 50 A. 406.

## DUE AND PROPER CARE

That degree of care
which is required of one for prevention of the ac-
cident. Odgers v. Clark, Del.Super., 19 A.2d 724,
726, 2 Terry 232.

## DUE AND REASONABLE CARE

Care which
reasonably prudent man would exercise under cir-
cumstances. Southern Ry. Co. v. Whetzel, 159
Va. 796, 167 S.E. 427, 431.

## DUE CARE

Just, proper, and sufficient care, so
far as the circumstances demand it; the absence
of negligence. That care which an ordinarily
prudent person would have exercised under the
circumstances. "Due care" is care proportioned
to any given situation, its surroundings, peculiar-
ities, and hazards. It may and often does require
extraordinary care. Tower v. Camp, 103 Conn. 41,
130 A. 86, 89. "Due care," "reasonable care," and
"ordinary care" are convertible terms. Corthell
v. Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., 291 Mass. 242,
196 N.E. 850, 851; Sweeney v. Blue Anchor Bev-
erage Co., 325 Pa. 216, 189 A. 231, 234.
This term, as usually understood in cases where
the gist of the action is the defendant's negli-
gence, implies not only that a party has not been
of no violation of law in relation to the subject-
matter or transaction which constitutes the cause
of action.

## DUE CONSIDERATION

To give such weight
or significance to a particular factor as under the
circumstances it seems to merit, and this involves
discretion. United States ex rel. Maine Potato
Growers & Shippers Ass'n v. Interstate Commerce
Commission, 88 F.2d 780, 783, 66 App.D.C. 398.

## DUE COMPENSATION

For condemned land is
the value of land taken and the damages, if any,
which result to him as a consequence of the tak-
ing without considering either general benefits or
injuries. Mississippi State Highway Commission
v. Hillman, 189 Misc. 850, 198 So. 565, 569.

## DUE COURSE HOLDER

See "Holder in Due
Course."

## DUE COURSE OF LAW

This phrase is synony-
mous with "due process of law," or "the law of
the land," and the general definition thereof is
"law in its regular course of administration
through courts of justice;" and, while not always
necessarily confined to judicial proceedings, yet
these words have such a signification, when used
to designate the kind of an eviction, or ouster,
from real estate by which a party is dispossessed,
as to preclude thereunder proof of a constructive
eviction resulting from the purchase of a para-
mount title when hostilely asserted by the party
holding it. Direct Plumbing Supply Co. v. City
of Dayton, 138 Ohio St. 540, 38 N.E.2d 70, 72, 137
A.L.R. 1058.

## DUE DATE

Time appointed or required for fil-
ing a tax return and, in the event of an extension
of time to file return, is the date to which period
for filing is extended. Langer v. Gray, N.D., 15
N.W.2d 732, 735. Under federal Revenue Act, "due
date," is the date fixed for payment of tax, or sev-
eral installments thereof. American Exchange
Irving Trust Co. v. U. S., Ct.C1., 52 F.2d 1027, 1028.
Within Texas inheritance tax law due date is not date of
assessment, but last day on which taxes could be paid with-
out incurring penalty. Half v. U. S., Ct.C1., 5 F.Supp. 132,
DUE DILIGENCE. See Diligence.

## DUE INFLUENCE

Influence obtained by per-
suasion and argument or by appeals to the af-
fections. In re Chamberlain's Estate, Cal.App.,
109 P.2d 449, 452.

## DUE NOTICE

No fixed rule can be established
as to what shall constitute "due notice." "Due"
is a relative term, and must be applied to each
case in the exercise of the discretion of the court
in view of the particular circumstances. Slattery
v. Doyle, 61 N.E. 264, 180 Mass. 27; Shellenberg-
er v. Warburton, 124 A. 189, 190, 279 Pa. 577; Car-
son v. Kalisch, 99 A: 199, 202, 89 N.J.Law, 458;
Franklin Brass Foundry Co. v. Shapiro & Aron-
son, C.C.A.Pa., 278 F. 435, 436; City of Sebree v.
Powell, 298 S.W. 1103, 1104, 221 Ky. 478.

## DUE POSTING

Includes stamping and placing
letter in United States mail. Tharp v. Loeb
Hardware Co., 135 So. 412, 413, 24 Ala.App. 344.

## DUE PROCESS OF LAW

Law in its regular
courte of administration through courts of jus-
tice. 3 Story, Const. 264, 661. "Due process of
law in each particular case means such an exer-
cise of the powers of the government as the set-
tled maxims of law permit and sanction, and un-
der such safeguards for the protection of indivi-
dual rights as those maxims prescribe for the
class of cases to which the one in question be-
longs." Cooley, Const. Lim. 441. Whatever dif-
ficulty may be experienced in giving to those
terms a definition which will embrace every per-
missible exertion of power affecting private rights,
and exclude such as is forbidden, there can be no
doubt of their meaning when applied to judicial
proceedings. They then mean a course of legal
proceedings according to those rules and princi-
ples which have been established in our systems
of jurisprudence for the enforcement and p.rotec-
tion of private rights. To give such proceedings
any validity, there must be a tribunal competent
by its constitution—that is, by the law of its crea-
tion—to pass upon the subject-matter of the suit;
and, if that involves merely a determination of
the personal liability of the defendant, he must be
brought within its jurisdiction by service of proc-
ess within the state, or his voluntary appearance.
Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U.S. 733, 24 L.Ed. 565. Due
process of law implies the right of the person af-
fected thereby to be present before the tribunal
which pronounces judgment upon the question of
life, liberty, or property, in its most comprehen-
sive sense; to be heard, by testimony or other-
wise, and to have the right of controverting, by
proof, every material fact which bears on the
question of right in the matter involved. If any
question of fact or liability be conclusively pre-
sumed against him, this is not due process of law.
Zeigler v. Railroad Co., 58 Ala. 599. These phras-
es in the constitution do not mean the general
body of the law, common and statute, as it was
at the time the constitution took effect; for that
would seem to deny the right of the legislature to
amend or repeal the law. They refer to certain
fundamental rights, which that system of juris-
prudence, of which ours is a derivative, has al-
ways recognized. Brown v. Levee Com'rs, 50
Miss. 468. "Due process of law," as used in the
constitution, cannot mean less than a prosecution
or suit instituted and conducted according to the
prescribed forms and solemnities for ascertaining
guilt, or determining the title to property. Em-
bury v. Conner, 3 N.Y. 511, 517, 53 Am.Dec. 325.
And see, generally, Davidson v. New Orleans, 96
U.S. 104, 24 L.Ed. 616.
"Law of the land," "due course of law," and "due proc-
ess of law" are synonymous. People v. Skinner, Cal., 110
P.2d 41, 45; State v. Rossi, 71 R.I. 284, 43 A.2d 323, 326;
Direct Plumbing Supply Co. v. City of Dayton, 138 Ohio St.
540, 38 N.E.2d 70, 72, 137 A.L.R. 1058; Stoner v. Higginson,
316 Pa. 481, 175 A. 527, 531. But "judicial process" and
"judicial proceedings" are not necessarily synonymous
with "due process." Pennsylvania Publications v. Penn-
sylvania Public Utility Commission, 152 Pa.Super. 279, 32
A.2d 40, 49; Barry v. Hall, 98 F.2d 222, 68 App.D.C. 350.
The essential elements of "due process of law" are notice
and opportunity to be heard and to defend in orderly pro-
ceeding adapted to nature of case, and the guarantee or
due process requires that every man have protection of day
in court and benefit of general law. Dimke v. Finke, 209
Minn. 29, 295 N.W. 75, 79; Di Maio v. Reid, 13 N.J.L. 17,
37 A.2d 829, 830. Daniel Webster defined this phrase to
mean a law which hears before it condemns, which pro-
ceeds on inquiry and renders judgment only after trial.

There is considerable resemblance between dun-
nage and ballast. The latter is used for trimming
the ship, and bringing it down to a draft of water
proper, and safe for sailing. Dunnage is placed
under the cargo to keep it from being wetted by
water getting into the hold, or between the differ-
ent parcels to keep them from bruising and injur-
ing each other. Great Western Ins. Co. v.
Thwing, 13 Wall. 674, 20 L.Ed. 607; Richards v.

"Dunnage" belongs to the category of crating

securing automobiles was held subject to the auto-
mobile rate and not to the lumber rate, under

In old English
law. Double the value of the marriage. While
an infant was in ward, the guardian had the pow-
er of tendering him or her a suitable match, with-
out disparagement, which if the infants refused,
they forfeited the value of the marriage to their
guardian, that is, so much as a jury would assess
or any one would give to the guardian for such
an alliance; and, if the infants married themselves
without the guardian's consent, they forfeited dou-
ble the value of the marriage. 2 Bl.Comm. 70;
Litt. § 110; Co.Litt. 82b.

## DUPLICATE

To double, repeat, make, or add
a thing exactly like a preceding one; reproduce
exactly. State v. Ogden, 20 N.M. 636, 151 P. 758,
DUPLICATE, n. When two written documents
are substantially alike, so that each might be a
copy or transcript from the other, while both
stand on the same footing as original instruments,
they are called "duplicates." Agreements, deeds,
and other documents are frequently executed in
duplicate, in order that each party may have an
original in his possession. Lorch v. Page, 97
Conn. 66, 115 A. 681, 682, 24 A.L.R. 1204.
A duplicate is sometimes defined to be the "copy" of a
thing ; but, though generally a copy, a duplicate differs
from a mere copy, in having all the validity of an original.
Nor, it seems need it be an exact copy. Defined also to be
the "counterpart" of an instrument; but in indentures
there is a distinction between counterparts executed by the
several parties respectively, each party affixing his or her
seal to only one counterpart, and duplicate originals, each
executed by all the parties. Maston v. Glen Lumber Co.,
65 Okl. 80, 163 P. 128, 129. The old indentures, charters, or
chirographs seem to have had the character of duplicates.
Burrill.
That which exactly resembles or corresponds to some-
thing else; another, correspondent to the first; hence, a
copy; transcript; counterpart; an original instrument
repeated; a document the same as another in essential
particulars; differing from a copy as being valid as an
original. Baker v. Sovereign Camp, W. 0. W., Mo.App.,
116 S.W.2d 513, 517.
The term is also frequently used to signify a
new original, made to take the place of an instru-
ment that has been lost or destroyed, and to have
the same force and effect. Benton v. Martin, 40
N.Y. 347.
In English law. The certificate of discharge
given to an insolvent debtor who takes the bene-
fit of the act for the relief of insolvent debtors.

jects in one legislative act, or two or more contro-
verted ultimate issues submitted in a single spe-
cial issue. Empire Oil & Gas Corporation v. U. S.,.

deprived of his liberty in order to force him to
compliance, or by violence, beating, or other ac-
tual injury, or duress per minas, consisting in
threats of imprisonment or great physical injury
or death. Duress may also include the same in-
juries, threats, or restraint exercised upon the

the crown. The jurisdiction of the Durham court
of pleas was transferred to the supreme court of

## DUTCH AUCTION

See Auction.

## DUTCH LOTTERY

Also known as the "class
lottery." As distinguished from the "Genoese
lottery" (q. v.), it is a scheme in which the num-
ber and value of the prizes are regularly esti-
mated, all the ticket holders are interested at
once in the play, and chance determines whether
a prize or a blank falls to a given number. Flem-
ing v. Bills, 3 Or. 286.

## DUTCH NET

A kind of fishing net commonly
known as a "pound net" (q. v.).

## DUTIES

In its most usual signification this word
is the synonym of imposts or customs; but it is
sometimes used in a broader sense, as including
all manner of taxes, charges, or governmental
impositions. Cooley v. Board of Wardens, 12 How.
299, 13 L.Ed. 996.

## DUTIES OF DETRACTION

Taxes levied upon
the removal from one state to another of prop-
erty acquired by succession or testamentary dis-
position. Frederickson v. Louisiana, 23 How. 445,
16 L.Ed. 577; In re Strobel's Estate, 5 App.Div.
621, 39 N.Y.S. 169. Cf. Droit de detraction.

## DUTIES ON IMPORTS

This term signifies not
merely a duty on the act of importation, but a
duty on the thing imported. It is not confined
to a duty levied while the article is entering the
country, but extends to a duty levied after it has
entered the country. Brown v. Maryland, 12
Wheat. 437, 6 L.Ed. 678.

## DUTY

A human action which is exactly conform-
able to the laws which require us to obey them.
Chicago, etc., R. Co. v. Filson, 35 Oki. 89, 91, 128
P. 298.
The words, "it shall be the duty," in ordinary legisla-
tion, imply the assertion of the power to command and to
coerce obedience. Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How. 66, 107,
16 L.Ed. 717.
In its use in jurisprudence, this word is the cor-
relative of right. Thus, wherever there exists
a right in any person, there also rests a corre-
sponding duty upon some other person or upon
all persons generally. But it is also used, in a
wider sense, to designate that class of moral ob-
ligations which lie outside the jural sphere; such,
namely, as rest upon an imperative ethical basis,
but have not been recognized by the law as within
its proper .province for purposes of enforcement
or redress. Thus, gratitude towards a benefactor
is a duty, but its refusal will not ground an action.
In this meaning "duty" is the equivalent of "moral
obligation," as distinguished from a "legal obli-
gation." Harrison v. Bush, 5 El. & Bl. 349.
Duty is considered by some modern ethicists to be the
fundamental conception of ethics and to be subject to
intuitive knowledge; by others it is conceived as that
which is ethically valid because sanctioned by law, society,
or religion. Webster, Dict.
As a technical term of the law, "duty" signifies a
thing due; that which is due from a person ; that
which a person owes to another. An obligation to
do a thing. A word of more extensive significa-
tion than "debt," although both are expressed by
the same Latin word "debitum." Bankers' Deposit
Guaranty & Surety Co. v. Barnes, 81 Kan. 422, 105
P. 697, 698. Sometimes, however, the term is used
synonymously with debt. Fox v. Hills, 1 Conn.
295, 303.
But in practice it is commonly reserved as the
designation of those obligations of performance,
care, or observance which rest upon a person in
an official or fiduciary capacity; as the duty of
an executor, trustee, manager, etc. Goodwine v.
Vermilion County, 271 Iii. 126, 110 N.E. 890, 892.
It also denotes a tax or impost due to the gov-
ernment upon the importation or exportation of
goods.
Judicial Duty. See Judicial.
Legal Duty. See Legal Duty.

## DUTY OF TONNAGE

A charge upon a vessel
as an instrument of commerce for entering, lying
in or leaving a port, and includes all taxes and du-

geles Lumber Products Co., D.C.Cal., 45 F.Supp.
77, 81; Marine Lighterage Corporation v. Lucken-
bach S. S. Co., 139 Misc. 612, 248 N.Y.S. 71, 72.

## DUTY OF WATER

Such a quantity of water
necessary when economically conducted and ap-
plied to land without unnecessary loss as will
result in the successful growing of crops. Enter-
prise Irr. Dist. v. Willis, 135 Neb. 827, 284 N.W. 326,
DUUMVIRI. (From duo, two, and viri, men.) A
general appellation among the ancient Romans,
given to any magistrates elected in pairs to fill
any office, or perform any function. Brande.
Duumviri municipales were two annual magis-
trates in the towns and colonies, having judicial

man, equip, and refit the navy. Calvin.

Cod. 1, 27, 2. A military officer having charge of
the borders or frontiers of the empire, called

word began to be used as a title of honor or dig-

In Roman law. A leader or military comman-
der. The commander of an army. Dig. 3, 2, 2, pr.
In feudal and old European law. Duke; a title
of honor, or order of nobility. 1 Bl.Comm. 397;
Crabb, Eng.Law, 236.

## DWELL

To have an abode; to inhabit; to live
in a place. Gardener v. Wagner, 9 Fed.Cas. 1,154;
Putnam v. Johnson, 10 Mass. 502; Eatontown v.
Shrewsbury, 49 N.J.Law, 188, 6 A. 319. More than
mere physical presence is sometimes required. It
must be in conformity with law. Kaplan v. Tod,
45 S.Ct. 257, 267 U.S. 228, 69 L.Ed. 585; U. S. v.
Tod, D.C., 292 F. 243, 245.
To delay, to pause or linger, to abide as a per-
manent residence or for a time; to live in a place,
to have one's residence or domicile, to reside. It
is synonymous with inhabit, live, sojourn, stay,
rest. MacLeod v. Stelle, 43 Idaho, 64, 249 P. 254,
DWELLING HOUSE. The house in which a man
lives with his family; a residence; abode; habita-
tion; the apartment or building, or group of
buildings, occupied by a family as a place of resi-
dence.
"Dwelling house" is a very flexible term. Its meaning
depends not only on context, but on the determination of
the courts not to permit public policy or justice to be
defeated by a word. "Dwelling house" often means any
building within the curtilage. Daniels v. Commonwealth,
172 Va. 583, 1 S.E.2d 333, 335. It may mean a single house
used by one family exclusively as a home. It may include
an apartment building, or any structure used by human
beings, partly for business and partly for residential pur-
poses, or a building regardless of habitation. Gerstell v.
Knight, 345 Pa. 83, 26 A.2d 329, 330.
In conveyancing. Includes all buildings at-
tached to or connected with the house. 2 Hil.Real
Prop. 338, and note. In the law of burglary. A
house in which the occupier and his family usually
reside, or, in other words, dwell and lie in. Whart.
Crim.Law, 357. Temporary absence will not de-
stroy character as "dwelling house." Haynes v.
State, 180 Miss. 291, 177 So. 360; State v. Bair,
112 W.Va. 655, 166 S.E. 369, 370, 85 A.L.R. 424.
Private Dwelling
Within a restrictive covenant, a place or house
in which a person or family lives in an individual
or private state, the covenant being violated by the
conversion of a house theretofore used as a resi-
dence for a single family into a residence for two
families, even though the outward appearance of
the house was not materially affected. Paine v.
Bergrose Development Corp., 198 N.Y.S. 311, 312,
119 Misc. 796. The distinction between a boarding
house and a "private dwelling house" is whether
the house is occupied as a home for the occupant
and his wife and child, or whether he occupied it
as a place for carrying on the business of keeping
boarders, although while prosecuting the business
and as a means of prosecuting it, he and his wife
and children live in the house also. Trainor v. Le
Beck, 101 N.J.Eq. 823, 139 A. 16, 17.
DWELLING-PLACE, or home, is some permanent
abode or residence, in which one has the intention
of remaining; it is not synonymous with "domi-
cile," as used in international law, but has a more
limited and restricted meaning. Nor is it synony-
mous with a "place of pauper settlement." Lisbon
v. Lyman, 49 N.H. 553.

## DYING DECLARATION

## DYING WITHOUT ISSUE

At common law this
phrase imports an indefinite failure of issue, and
not a dying without issue surviving at the time of
the death of the first taker. But this rule has
been changed in some of the states, by statute or
decisions, and in England by St. 7 Wm. IV, and 1
Vict. c. 26, § 29.
The words "die without issue," and "die without leaving
issue," in a devise of real estate, import an indefinite fail-
ure of issue, and not the failure of issue at the death of the
first taker. And no distinction is to be made between the
words "without issue" and "without leaving issue." Har-
well v. Harwell, 151 Tenn. 587, 271 S.W. 353, 355.
In Connecticut and other states it has been repeatedly
held that the expression "dying without issue," and like
expressions, have reference to the time of the death of the
party, and not to an indefinite failure of issue. Phelps v.
Phelps, 55 Conn. 359, 11 A. 596; Briggs v. Hopkins, 103
Ohio St. 321, 132 N.E. 843.
Dying without children imports not a failure of issue at
any indefinite future period, but a leaving no children at
the death of the legatee. Condict v. King, 13 N.J.Eq. 375.
The law favors vesting of estates, and limitation such as
"dying without issue," refers to a definite period, fixed in
will, rather than to an indefinite failure of issue. Howard
v. Howard's Trustee, 212 Ky. 847, 280 S.W. 156, 157. Where
context is such as to show clearly that testator intended
the phrase "die without issue" to mean that, if first taker
die without issue during life of testator, the second taker
shall stand in his place and prevent a lapse, the words "die
without issue" are taken to mean death during life of
testator. Martin v. Raff, 114 Ind.App. 507, 52 N.E.2d 839,
DYKE-REED, or DYKE-REEVE. An officer who
has the care and oversight of the dykes and drains
in fenny counties.

ent, they are of minor importance. Dungl.Med.
Dict.

## DYVOUR'S HABIT

In Scotch law. A habit
which debtors who are set free on a cessio bono-
rum are obliged to wear, unless in the summons
and process of cessio it be libeled, sustained, and
proved that the bankruptcy proceeds from mis-
fortune. And bankrupts are condemned to sub-
mit to the habit, even where no suspicion of fraud
lies against them, if they have been dealers in
an illicit trade. Ersk.Prin. 4, 3, 13.
