## EARL

A title of nobility, formerly the highest
in England, now the third, ranking between a
marquis and a viscount, and corresponding with
the French "comte" and the German "graf." The
title originated with the Saxons, and is the most
ancient of the English peerage. William the Con-
queror first made this title hereditary, giving it
in fee to his nobles; and allotting them for the
support of their state the third penny out of the
sheriff's court, issuing out of all pleas of the shire,
whence they had their ancient title "shiremen."
At present the title is accompanied by no territory,
private or judicial rights, but merely confers no-
bility and an hereditary seat in the house of lords.

poration's capital invested in tangible property,
the balance being deemed to give the net earn-
ings attributable to the special franchise, the value

ance at a rate 1 per cent. higher than that found
as a matter of fact to be a fair and reasonable
return on the tangible property. People ex rel.

of another. Weigold v. Bates, 258 N.Y.S. 695, 144

A. 121, 122.

Equitable Easements
The special easements created by derivation of

504, 12 Am.Rep. 147.
Negative Easement
Those where the owner of the servient estate is
prohibited from doing something otherwise law-

Private or Public Easements
A private easement is one in which the enjoy.
ment is restricted to one or a few individuals,
while a public easement is one the right to the
enjoyment of which is vested in the public gen-
erally or in an entire community; such as an ease-
ment of passage on the public streets and high-
ways or of navigation on a stream. Kennelly v.
Jersey City, 57 N.J.Law, 293, 30 A. 531, 26 L.R.A.
Quasi Easement
An "easement," in the proper sense of the word,
can only exist in respect of two adjoining pieces
of land occupied by different persons, and can
only impose a negative duty on the owner of the
servient tenement. Hence an obligation on the
owner of land to repair the fence between his and
his neighbor's land is not a true easement, but is
sometimes called a "quasi easement." Gale,
Easem. 516; Sweet.
Reciprocal Negative Easement
If the owner of two or more lots, so situated
as to bear the relation, sells one with restrictions
of benefit to the land retained, the servitude be-
comes mutual, and, during the period of restraint,
the owner of the lot or lots retained can do noth-
ing forbidden to the owner of the lot sold; this
being known as the doctrine of "reciprocal nega-
tive easement." Sanborn v. McLean, 233 Mich.
227, 206 N.W. 496, 497.
Secondary Easement
One which is appurtenant to the primary or ac-
tual easement; every easement includes such "sec-
ondary easements," that is, the right to do such
things as are necessary for the full enjoyment of
the easement itself. Toothe v. Bryce, 50 N.J.Eq.
589, 25 A. 182.

## EAST

In the absence of other words qualifying
its meaning, the word "east" describing boundaries
means due east. Anaheim Sugar Co. v. Orange
County, 181 Cal. 212, 183 P. 809, 813; Livingston
Oil & Gas Co. v. Shasta Oil Co., Tex.Civ.App., 114
S.W.2d 378, 381. See, also, Easterly.
In the customs laws of the United States, the
words "countries east of the Cape of Good Hope"
mean countries with which, formerly, the Unit-
ed States ordinarily carried on commercial inter-
course by passing around that cape. Powers v.
Conley, 101 U.S. 790, 25 L.Ed. 805.

## EAST GREENWICH

or in the county of Kent, England; mentioned in
royal grants or patents, as descriptive of the ten-
ure of free socage.

## EAST INDIA COMPANY

Originally established
for prosecuting the trade between England and
India, which they acquired a right to carry on ex-
clusively. Since the middle of the last century,
however, the company's political affairs had be-
come of more importance than their commerce.
In 1858, by 21 & 22 Vict. c. 106, the government of
the territories of the company was transferred to
the crown. Wharton.

## EASTER

A feast of the Christian church held in
memory of the Saviour's resurrection. The
Greeks and Latins call it "pascha," (passover,)
to which Jewish feast our Easter answers. This
feast has been annually celebrated since the time
of the apostles, and is one of the most important
festivals in the Christian calendar, being that
which regulates and determines the times of all
the other movable feasts. Enc. Lond.
EASTER-OFFERINGS, or EASTER-DUES.
English law. Small sums of money paid to the
parochial clergy by the parishioners at Easter as
a compensation for personal tithes, or the tithe
for personal labor; recoverable under 7 & 8 Wm.

## III

c. 6, before justices of the peace.

## EASTER TERM

In English law. Formerly One
of the four movable terms of the courts, but aft-
erwards a fixed term, beginning on the 15th of
April and ending on the 8th of May in every year,
though sometimes prolonged so late as the 13th
of May, under St. 11 Geo. IV. and 1 Wm. IV. c. 70.
From November 2, 1875, the division of the legal
year into terms is abolished so far as concerns
the administration of justice. 3 Steph.Comm.
482-486; Mozley & Whiteley.

## EASTERLING

A coin struck by Richard II.
which is supposed by some to have given rise to
the name of "sterling," as applied to English mon-
ey.

## EASTERLY

This word, when used alone, will
be construed to mean "due east." But that is a
rule of necessity growing out of the indefinite-
ness of the term, and has no application where
other words are used for the purpose of qualify-
ing its meaning. Where such is the case, it means
precisely what the qualifying word makes it
mean. Walker v. City of Los Angeles, 23 Cal.App.
634, 139 R 89, 90. See East.

## EASTINUS

An easterly coast or country.

## EASTMAN FORMULA

In determining fixed

freshments of any kind, not including spirits,

(1) Archbishops and bishops; (2) deans and
chapters; (3) archdeacons; (4) rural deans; (5)
parsons (under whom are included appropriators)

church, may be considered to be a species of ec-
clesiastical authorities. Wharton.

## ECCLESIASTICAL COMMISSIONERS

doctrine, creed, or form of worship of the church,

App. 249, 131 S.W.2d 375, 380.

sion of the debtor is properly called the "tally,"
the other "echantillon." Poth.Obl. pt. 4, c. 1, art.

closely resembles the convulsions of epilepsy, and
is often fatal.

## ECLECTIC PRACTICE

In medicine. That sys-
tem followed by physicians who select their modes
of practice and medicines from various schools.
Webster.
"Without professing to understand much of medical
phraseology, we suppose that the terms 'allopathic prac-
tice' and 'legitimate business' mean the ordinary method
commonly adopted by the great body of learned and emi-
nent physicians, which is taught in their institutions, estab-
lished by their highest authorities, and accepted by the
larger and more respectable portion of the community. By
'eclectic practice,' without imputing to it, as the counsel
for the plaintiff seem inclined to, an odor of illegality,
we presume is intended another and different system,
unusual and eccentric, not countenanced by the classes
before referred to, but characterized by them as spurious
and denounced as dangerous. It is sufficient to say that the
two modes of treating human maladies are essentially dis-
tinct, and based upon different views of the nat*re and
causes of diseases, their appropriate remedies, and the
modes of applying them." Bradbury v. Bardin, 34 Conn.

## ECONOMIZER

As applied to boiler construc-
tion, a contrivance or device in which water is

## EDICT

A positive law promulgated by the sov-
ereign of a country, and having reference either
to the whole land or some of its divisions, but
usually relating to affairs of state. It differs
from a "public proclamation," in that it enacts a
new statute, and carries with it the authority of
law, whereas the latter is, at most, a declaration
of a law before enacted. In Roman law. Some-
times, a citation to appear before a judge. A
"special edict" was a judgment in a case; a "gen-
eral edict" was in effect a statute. See Edictum.

## EDICTAL CITATION

In Scotch law. A citation
published at the market-cross of Edinburgh, and
pier and shore of Leith. Used against foreign-
ers not within the kingdom, but having a landed
estate there, and against natives out of the king-
dom. Bell.

## EDICTS OF JUSTINIAN

Thirteen constitutions
or laws of this prince, found in most editions of
the Corpus Juris Civilis, after the Novels. Being
confined to matters of police in the provinces of
the empire, they are of little use.

## EDICTUM

In the Roman law. An edict; a man-
date, or ordinance. An ordinance, or law, enacted
by the emperor without the senate; belonging to
the class of constitutiones principis. Inst. 1, 2, 6.
An edict was a mere voluntary constitution of the
emperor; differing from a rescript, in not being
returned in the way of answer; and from a de-
cree, in not being given in judgment; and from
both, in not being founded upon solicitation. Tayl.
Civil Law, 233.
A general order published by the praetor, on en-
tering upon his office, containing the system of
rules by which he would administer justice during
the year of his office. Dig. 1, 2, 2, 10; Mackeld.
Rom.Law, § 35; Tayl.Civil Law, 214. See Calvin.

## EDICTUM ANNUUM

The annual edict or system
of rules promulgated by a Roman praetor immedi-
ately upon assuming his office, setting forth the
principles by which he would be guided in deter-
mining causes during his term of office. Mackeld.
Rom.Law, § 36.

## EDICTUM PERPETUUM

The perpetual edict.
A compilation or system of law in fifty books, di-
gested by Julian, from the praetor's edicts and oth-
er parts of the Jus Honorarium. All the remains
of it which have come down to us are the extracts
of it in the Digests. Butl.Hor.Jur. 52.

## EDICTUM PROVINCIALE

An edict or system of
rules for the administration of justice, similar to
the edict of the praetor, put forth by the procon-
suls and proprEetors in the provinces of the Roman
Empire. Mackeld.Rom.Law, § 36.

## EDICTUM THEODORICI

This is the first col-
lection of law that was made after the downfall
of the Roman power in Italy. It was promulgated
by Theodoric, king of the Ostrogoths, at Rome in
A.D. 500. It consists of 154 chapters, in which we
recognize parts taken from the Code and Novellw
of Theodosius, from the Codices Gregorianus and
Hermogenianus, and the Sentential of Paulus. The
edict was doubtless drawn up by Roman writers,
but the original sources are more disfigured and
altered than in any other compilation. This col-
lection of law was intended to apply both to the
Goths and the Romans, so far as its provisions
went; but, when it made no alteration in the Goth-
ic law, that law was still to be in force. Savigny,
Geschichte des R. R.

## EDICTUM TRALATITIUM

Where a Roman prw-
tor, upon assuming office, did not publish a wholly
new edict, but retained the whole or a principal
part of the edict of his predecessor ( as was usually
the case) only adding to it such rules as appeared
to be necessary to adapt it to changing social
conditions or juristic ideas, it was called "edictum
tralatitium." Mackeld.Rom.Law, § 36.

## EDITION

Any quantity of books put forth to the
bookselling trade at one time by the publisher. 4
K. & J. 656. A new edition is published whenever,
having in his warehouse a certain number of
copies, the publisher issues a fresh batch of them
to the public.

## EDITOR

One who directs or supervises the poli-
cies and contributions of a newspaper, magazine,
work of reference, or the like. Brokaw v. Cottrell,
211 N.W. 184, 187, 114 Neb. 858. The term is held
to include not only the person who writes or se-
lects the articles for publication, but he who pub-
lishes a paper and puts it in circulation. Pennoy-
er v. Neff, 95 U.S. 721, 24 L.Ed. 565.

calling or business, or for activity and usefulness
in life. In re Wolfe's Estate, 299 N.Y.S. 99, 102, 164
Misc. 504.

## EDUCATION

Comprehends not merely the in-
struction received at school or college, but the
whole course of training, moral, intellectual, and
physical. Education may be particularly directed
to either the mental, moral, or physical powers and
faculties, but in its broadest and best sense it re-
lates to them all. Barbers' Commission of Mobile
County v. Hardeman, 21 So.2d 118, 120, 31 Ala.App.
626. Acquisition of all knowledge tending to train
and develop the individual. Mifchell v. Reeves,
123 Conn. 549, 196 A. 785, 788, 15 A.L.R. 1114.
"Education" is not confined to the improvement and
cultivation of the mind, but may consist of the cultivation
of one's religious or moral sentiments, and likewise may
consist in the development of one's physical faculties.
Commissioners of District of Columbia v. Shannon & Luchs
Const. Co., 57 App.D.C. 67, 17 F.2d 219, 220; Jones v.
Better Business Bureau of Oklahoma City, C.C.A.Okla., 123
F.2d 767, 769.

## EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION

A school, semi-
nary, college, or educational establishment, not
necessarily a chartered institution. Ward Semi-
nary for Young Ladies v. City of Nashville, 129
Tenn. 412, 167 S.W. 113. As used in a zoning ordi-
nance, the term may include not only buildings,
but also all grounds necessary for the accomplish-
ment of the full scope of educational instruction,
including those things essential to mental, moral,
and physical development. Commissioners of Dis-
trict of Columbia v. Shannon & Luchs Const. Co.,
57 App.D.C. 67, 17 F.2d 219, 220.

## EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES

Synonymous with
an educational undertaking, and whatever educates
is within the meaning of an "educational under-
taking." Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of
Freemasonry v. Board of County Com'rs, 122 Neb.
586, 241 N.W. 93, 95.
formation or inspirational suggestions which cause
the individual to think and act along proper lines.
Jones v. Better Business Bureau of Oklahoma
City, C.C.A.Okl., 123 F.2d 767, 769.

## EFFECT

To do; to produce; to make; to
bring to pass; to execute; enforce; accomplish.
Vailsburg Motor Corporation v. Fidelity & Casual-
ty Co., 110 N.J.L. 209, 164 A. 408, 409. A be-
lief that a mortgage would "effect" a preference
under the bankruptcy act is equivalent to a belief
that it would "operate as" a preference. Ogden
v. Reddish, D.C.Ky., 200 F. 977, 979.

## EFFECT

Result. Western Indemnity Co. v.
MacKechnie, Tex.Civ.App., 214 S.W. 456, 460; Beel-
er v. People, 58 Colo. 451, 146 P. 762, 764. The re-
sult which an instrument between parties will
produce in their relative rights, or which a stat-
ute will produce upon the existing law, as dis-
covered from the language used, the forms em-
ployed, or other materials for construing it. The
operation of a law, of an agreement, or an act.

tion," etc., are used interchangeably. Maize v. State, 4
Ind. 342.

effect. Schutze v. Dabney, Tex.Civ.App., 204 S.W.
342, 347.

## EFFECTING LOAN

Renewal of original note
without lending of new money held not "effecting
of loan," within statute prohibiting officers or
.
employees of banking department from effecting
loans from state bank. To effect a loan within
such statute means to bring about a loan, to ac-
complish, fulfill, or produce or make a loan. It
means the result or consequence, the bringing into
operation of a loan; while "renewal" is not a loan,
but an extension of the time of payment. State v.
Love, 150 So. 196, 199, 170 Miss. 666, 90 A.L.R. 506.

## EFFECTIVE PROCURING CAUSE

tive procuring cause," of sale of realty is ordi-
narily the broker who first secures the serious at-
tention of the customer and is instrumental in
bringing the parties together. In re Cowan's Es-

kind. Ettlinger v. Importers' & Exporters' Ins. Co.
of New York, 247 N.Y.S. 260, 262, 138 Misc. 743.
In this sense, the term is more comprehensive than the
word "goods," as including fixtures and choses in action,
which "goods" will not include. Bank v. Byram, 131 Ill.
92, 22 N.E. 842.
Also, every kind of property, real and personal.
Child v. Orton, 119 N.J.Eq. 438, 183 A. 709, 710;

If the term is used simpliciter, as in a gift of "all

tate, unless an intention appears to the contrary.

N.Y.S.2d 673, 674, 675. The meaning of the term is
determined by the context and surrounding cir-
cumstances; Coffman's Adm'r v. Coffman, 131 Va.
456, 109 S.E. 454, 459; and is broad enough to in-
clude property of any kind. In re Lafferty's Es-
tate, 311 Pa. 469, 167 A. 49, 50.
The words "real and personal effects" will em-
brace the whole estate. Hogan v. Jackson, Cowp.
304; The Alpena, D.C., 7 F. 361; 15 M. & W. 450;
Foxall v. McKenney, 3 Cranch C.C. 206, Fed.Cas.

C.C.A.Ind., 102 F.2d 160, 162.

## EFFICIENT CAUSE

The working cause; that
cause which produces effects or results; an inter-
vening cause, which produces results which would
not have come to pass except for its interposition,
and for which, therefore, the person who set in
motion the original chain of causes is not respon-
sible. Southland-Greyhound Lines v. Cotten, Tex.
Civ.App., 55 S.W.2d 1066, 1069; The cause which
originates and sets in motion the dominating
agency that necessarily proceeds through other
causes as mere instruments or vehicles in a na-
tural line of causation to the result. That cause
of an injury to which legal liability attaches.
Bole v. Pittsburgh Athletic Club, C.C.A., 205 F. 468,
471, 46 L.R.A.,N.S., 602. The "proximate cause."

results. State v. Des Champs, 126 S.C. 416, 120 S.

dicates the conclusion or expiration of an agreed
term of years specified in the deed or writing, such

termination of the term by the acts of the parties
or by some unexpected or unusual incident or

try, pretending to have skill in telling fortunes,
and to deceive the common people, but live chief-
ly by filching or stealing, and, therefore, the stat-

## EJECTIONE CUSTODI)E

In old English law.
Ejectment of ward. This phrase, which is the
Latin equivalent for the French "ejectment de
garde," was the title of a writ which lay for a
guardian when turned out of any land of his
ward during the minority of the latter. Brown.
It lay to recover the land or person of his ward,
or both. Fitzh. N.B. 139, L.; Co.Litt. 199.
EJECTIONE FIRM1E. Ejection, or ejectment of
farm. The name of a writ or action of trespass,
which lay at common law where lands or tene-
ments were let for a term of years, and after-
wards the lessor, reversioner, remainder-man, or
any stranger ejected or ousted the lessee of his
term, ferme, or farm, (ipsum a firma ejecit.) In
this case the latter might have his writ of ejec-
tion, by which he recovered at first damages for
the trespass only, but it was afterwards made a
remedy to recover back the term itself, or the re-
mainder of it, with damages. Reg.Orig. 227b;
Fitzh. Nat. Brev. 220, F, G; 3 Bl.Comm. 199; Litt.
§ 322; Crabb, Eng.Law, 290, 448. It is the foun-
dation of the modern action of ejectment.

## EJECTMENT

At common law, this was the
name of a mixed action (springing from the earlier
personal action of ejectione firmce) which lay for
the recovery of the possession of land, and for
damages for the unlawful detention of its pos-
session. The action was highly fictitious, being
in theory only for the recovery of a term for
years, and brought by a purely fictitious person, as
lessee in a supposed lease from the real party in
interest. The latter's title, however, must be
established in order to warrant a recovery, and the
establishment of such title, though nominally a
mere incident, is in reality the object of the ac-
tion. Hence this convenient form of suit came to
be adopted as the usual method of trying titles
N.J.Law, 260, 51 A. 509, 57 L.R.A. 956, 91 Am.St.
Rep. 433. In England, since the Judicature Act,
ejectment has given place to a new action for
the recovery of land. Ejectment has been mate-
rially modified in many of the states, though still
retaining the name. For the history of ejectment,.
see 3 Sel.Essays in Anglo-Amer. L. Hist. 611.
It was the only mixed action at common law, the whole.
method of proceeding in which was anomalous, and
depended on fictions invented and upheld by the court for
the convenience of justice, in order to escape from the
inconveniences which were found to attend the ancient
forms of real and mixed actions.
It is also a form of action by which possessory
titles to corporeal hereditaments may be tried and
possession obtained.
Ejectment Bill
A bill in equity brought merely for the recovery
of real property, together with an account of the-
rents and profits, without setting out any distinct
ground of equity jurisdiction; hence demurrable.
Crane v. Conklin, 1 N.J.Eq. 353, 22 Am.Dec. 519.
Equitable Ejectment
A proceeding in use in Pennsylvania, brought
to enforce specific performance of a contract for
the sale of land, and for some other purposes,.
which is in form an action of ejectment, but is in
reality a substitute for a bill in equity. Riel v..
Gannon, 161 Pa. 289, 29 A. 55.
Justice Ejectment
A statutory proceeding in Vermont, for the evic
tion of a tenant holding over after termination
of the lease or breach of its conditions. Foss v._
Stanton, 76 Vt. 365, 57 A. 942.

## EJECTOR

One who ejects, puts out, or dispos-
sesses another.
Casual Ejector
The nominal defendant in an action of eject-
ment; so called because, by a fiction of law pecu-
liar to that action, he is supposed to come casual
ly or by accident upon the premises and to eject
the lawful possessor. 3 Bl.Comm. 203.

## EJECTUM

That which is thrown up by the sea..
Also jetsam, wreck, etc. Warder v. La Belle Cre-
ole, 1 Pet.Adm.Dec. 43, Fed.Cas.No.17,165.

## EJECTUS

In old English law. A whore-mong-
er. Blount.

## EJERCITORIA

In Spanish law. The name of'
an action lying against a ship's owner, upon the
contracts or obligations made by the master for-
repairs or supplies. It corresponds to the actio
exercitoria of the Roman law. Mackeld. Rom.
Law, § 512.

## EJIDOS

In Spanish law. Commons; lands us-
ed in common by the inhabitants of a city, pueblo,.
or town, for pasture, wood, threshing-ground, etc..

place.

## EJUS EST INTERPRETARI CUJUS EST CON- DERE

It is his to interpret whose it is to enact.
Tayl. Civil Law, 96.

## EJUS EST NOLLE, QUI POTEST VELLE

He
who can will, [exercise volition,] has a right to
refuse to will, [to withhold consent.] Dig. 50,
7, 3. This maxim is sometimes written, Ejus est
non nolle qui potest velle, and is translated, "He
may consent tacitly who may consent expressly."

## EJUS EST PERICULUM CUJUS EST DOMIN- IUM AUT COPMMODUM

He who has the do-
minion or advantage has the risk. Bart.Max. 33.

## EJUS NULLA CULPA EST, CUI PARERE NEC- ESSE SIT

No guilt attaches to him who is com-
pelled to obey. Dig. 50, 17, 169, pr. Obedience to
existing laws is a sufficient extenuation of guilt
before a civil tribunal. Broom, Max. 12, note.

## EJUSDEM GENERIS

Of the same kind, class,
or nature.
In the construction of laws, wills, and other instruments,
the "ejusdem generis rule" is, that where general words
follow an enumeration of persons or things, by words of a
particular and specific meaning, such general words are not
to be construed in their widest extent, but are to be held
as applying only to persons or things of the same general
kind or class as those specifically mentioned. Black, Interp.
of Laws, 141; Goldsmith v. U. S., C.C.A.N.Y., 42 F.2d
133, 137; Aleksich v. Industrial Accident Fund, 116 Mont.
69, 151 P.2d 1016, 1021. The rule, however, does not neces-
sarily require that the general provision be limited in its
scope to the identical things specifically named. Nor does
it apply when the context manifests a contrary intention.
The maxim "ejusdem generis," is only an illustration of
the broader maxim, "noscitur a sod's." State v. Western
Union Telegraph Co., 196 Ala. 570, 72 So. 99, 100.

## ELABORARE

In old European law. To gain,
acquire, or purchase, ag by labor and industry.

## ELABORATUS

Property which is the acquisi-
tion of labor. Spelman.

## ELASTIC

Pertaining to a substance having the
property of returning or springing back to its
original form after being disarranged by pressure
or applied force;—to be distinguished from "plas-
tic," which applies to a substance capable of being
molded and pressed into form. Diamond Patent
Co. v. Webster Bros., C.C.A.Cal., 249 F. 155, 157;
Kitson Co. v. Lattimer-Stevens Co., C.C.A.Pa., 37
F.2d 562, 563.

## ELDER BRETHREN

A distinguished body of
men, elected as masters of Trinity House, an insti-
tution incorporated in the reign of Henry VIII.,
charged with numerous important duties relating
to the marine, such as the superintendence of
lighthouses. Mozley & Whitley; 2 Steph.Comm.
502. The full title of the corporation is Elder
Brethren of the Holy and Undivided Trinity.

## ELDER TITLE

A title of earlier date, but com-
ing simultaneously into operation with a title of
younger origin, is called the "elder title," and pre-
vails.
The eldest son is the first-born, the primo-genitus;
L.R. 2 App.Cas. 698; L.R. 12 Ch.Div. 171; Ander-
son v. Anderson, C.C.A.S.C., 221 F. 871, 874. If
there is only one son, he may still be described as
the "eldest." L.R. 7 H.L. 644.

## ELECTA UNA VIA, NON DATUR RECURSUS AD ALTERAM

He who has chosen one way can-
not have recourse to another. 10 Toull. no. 170.

## ELECTED

The word "elected," in its ordinary
signification, carries with it the idea of a vote,
generally popular, sometimes more restricted, and
cannot be held the synonym of any other mode of
filling a position. Kimberlin v. State, 130 Ind.
120, 29 N.E. 773, 14 L.R.A. 858, 30 Am.St.Rep. 208.
ELECTIO EST INTERNA LIBERA ET SPON-
TANEA SEPARATIO UNIUS REI AB ALIA,
SINE COMPULSIONE, CONSISTENS IN ANIMO
ET VOLUNTATE. Dyer, 281. Election is an in-
ternal, free, and spontaneous separation of one
thing from another, without compulsion, consist-
ing in intention and will.

## ELECTIO SEMEL FACTA, ET PLACITUM TES- TATUM NON PATITUR REGRESSUM

Co.Litt.
146. Election once made, and plea witnessed (or
intent shown), suffers not a recall.

## ELECTION

The act of choosing or selecting
one or more from a greater number of persons,
things, courses, or rights. The choice of an al-
ternative. State v. Tucker, 54 Ala. 210.
The internal, free, and spontaneous separation of one
thing from another, without compulsion, consisting in
intention and will. Dyer, 281.
The selection of one person from a specified
class to discharge certain duties in a state, cor-
poration, or society. Smith v. McQueen, 232 Ala.
90, 166 So. 788, 791.
With respect to the choice of persons to fill public office
or the decision of a particular public question or public
policy the term means in ordinary usage the expression by
vote of the will of the people or of a somewhat numerous
body of electors. State v. State Board of Canvassers, 78
S.C. 461, 59 S.E. 145. But this is not necessarily so, for the
term may apply to the selection by a city council of one
of their number as mayor.
"Election" ordinarily has reference to a choice or selec-
tion by electors, while "appointment" refers to a choice or
selection by an individual, as the Governor, or an official
body. Board of Education of Boyle County v. McChesney,
235 Ky. 692, 32 S.W.2d 26, 27. But the terms are some-
times used interchangeably. Van Cleve v. Wallace, 216
Minn. 500, 13 N.W.2d 467, 469.
A primary election is an "election" within the constitu-
tional provision. United States v. Classic, 61 S.Ct. 1031,
1039, 313 U.S. 299, 85 L.Ed. 1368; Ex parte Hawthorne, 116
Fla. 608, 156 So. 619, 622, 96 A.L.R. 572. But the contrary
view has been expressed, Mathes v. State, 173 Tenn. 511,
121 S.W.2d 548, 549; People ex rel. Lindstrand v. Emmer-
son, 333 Ill. 606, 165 N.E. 217, 223, 62 A.L.R. 912. Refer-
endum elections are "elections". Masters v. Duval County,
114 Fla. 205, 154 So. 172, 176. To the contrary, Vulcan Last
Co. v. State, 194 Wis. 636, 217 N.W. 412, 414.
The choice which is open to a debtor who is
bound in an alternative obligation to select either
one of the alternatives.
Equitable Election
See Equitable Election.
One at which the officers to be elected are
such as belong to the general government,—that
is, the general and central political organization
of the whole state; as distinguished from an elec-
tion of officers for a particular locality only. Al-
so, one held for the selection of an officer after
the expiration of the full term of the former of-
ficer; thus distinguished from a special election,
which is one held to supply a vacancy in office
occurring before the expiration of the full term
for which the incumbent was elected. Downs v.
State, 78 Md. 128, 26 A. 1005. One that regularly
recurs in each election precinct of the state on
a day designated by law for the selection of of-
ficers, or is held in such entire territory pursuant
to an enactment specifying a single day for the
ratification or rejection of one or more measures
submitted to the people by the Legislative As-
sembly, and not for the election of any officer.
Bethune v. Funk, 166 P. 931, 932, 85 Or. 246. One
that is held throughout the entire state or terri-
tory. Territory v. Ricordati, 18 N.M. 10, 132 P.
1139, 1140. An election for the choice of a na-
tional, state, judicial, district, municipal, county,
or township official, required by law to be held
regularly at a designated time, to fill a new of-
fice or a vacancy in an office at the expiration
of the full term thereof. Eakle v. Board of Edu-
cation of Independent School Dist. of Henry, 97
W.Va. 434, 125 S.E. 165, 168. In statutes, the term
may include a primary election. Kelso v. Cook,
184 Ind. 173, 110 N.E. 987, 993, Ann.Cas.1918E, 68.
Contra, under a municipal charter, City Council
of San Jose v. Goodwin, 196 Cal. 274, 237 P. 548,
549. In Vermont, the term is used throughout the
Public Statutes to designate what before had com-
monly been known as "freeman's meeting."

In Criminal Law
The choice, by the prosecution, upon which of
several counts in an indictment (charging distinct
offenses of the same degree, but not parts of a
continuous series of acts) it will proceed. Jack-
son v. State, 95 Ala. 17, 10 So. 657.
In Practice
The liberty of choosing (or the act of choosing)
one out of several means afforded by law for the
redress of an injury, or one out of several avail-
able forms of action.
An "election of remedies" arises when one having two
coexistent but inconsistent remedies chooses to exercise
one, in which event he loses the right to thereafter exer-
cise the other. Mosher Mfg. Co. v. Eastland W. F. & G. R.
Co., Tex.Civ.App., 259 S.W. 253, 255.
An "election of remedies" is choosing between two or
more different and coexisting modes of procedure and
relief allowed by law on the same state of facts. Pacific
Mut. Life Ins. Co. of California v. Rhame, D.C.S.C., 32
F.Supp. 59, 63; Doggett Lumber Co. v. Perry, 212 N.C. 713,
194 S.E. 475, 478.
"Election of remedies" is a species of estoppel in pals.
Mansfield v. Pickwick Stages, Northern Division, 191 Cal.
129, 215 P. 389, 390.
Black's Law Dictionary Revised 4th Ed.-39
A widow's election is her choice whether she
will take under the will or under the statute;
that is, whether she will accept the provision
made for her in the will, and acquiesce in her
husband's disposition of his property, or disre-
gard it and claim what the law allows her. Logan
v. Logan, Tex.Civ.App., 112 S.W.2d 515, 518;
Schlimme v. Schlimme, 364 Ill. 303, 4 N.E.2d 369,
An "election under the will" means that a lega-
tee or devisee under a will is put to the choice of
accepting the beneficial interest offered by the
donor in lieu of some estate which he is entitled
to, but which is taken from him by the terms of
the will. McDermid v. Bourhill, 101 Or. 305, 199
P. 610, 612, 22 A.L.R. 428.
Primary Election
An election by the voters of a ward, precinct,
or other small district, belonging to a particular
party, of representatives or delegates to a con-
vention which is to meet and nominate the candi-
dates of their party to stand at an approaching
municipal or general election. State v. Woodruff,
68 N.J.Law, 89, 52 A. 294. Also, an' election to
select candidates for office by a political organiza-
tion, the voters being restricted to the members
or supporters of such organization. Kelso v.
Cook, 184 Ind. 173, 110 N.E. 987, Ann.Cas.1918E,
68. They are not in reality elections but are
merely nominating devices. Van Dyke v. Thomp-
son, 136 Tenn. 136, 189 S.W. 62, 66.
Regular Election
One recurring at stated times fixed by law.
State v. Andresen, 110 Or. 1, 222 P. 585, 587. A gen-
eral, usual, or stated election. When applied to
elections, the terms "regular" and "general" are
used interchangeably and synonymously. The
word "regular" is used in reference to a general
election occurring throughout the state. State v.
Conrades, 45 Mo. 47; Ward v. Clark, 35 Kan. 315,
10 P. 827.
Result of Election
Usually, the expression of the will of the voters
as determined by a count of the ballots. Cipow-
ski v. Calumet City, 322 Ill. 575, 153 N.E. 613, 614.
Special Election
An election for a particular emergency; out of
the regular course; as one held to fill a vacancy
arising by death of the incumbent of the office.
State v. Andresen, 110 Or. 1, 222 P. 585, 587. In
a statute, any election at which officers are not
chosen. Hutchins v. City of Des Moines, 176 Iowa
189, 157 N.W. 881, 883. In determining whether
an election is special or general, regard must be
had to the subject-matter as well as date of the
election, and, if an election occurs throughout
state uniformly by direct operation of law, it is
a "general election," but, if it depends on employ-
ment of special preliminary proceeding peculiar
to process which may or may not occur, and the
less than whole state, it is a "special election."
Hill v. Hartzell, 121 Or. 4, 252 P. 552, 555.

## ELECTION AUDITORS

In English law. Offi-
cers annually appointed, to whom was committed
the duty of taking and publishing the account of
all expenses incurred at parliamentary elections.
See 17 & 18 Vict. c. 102, §§ 18, 26-28. But these
sections have been repealed by 26 Vict. c. 29,
which throws the duty of preparing the accounts
on the declared agent of the candidate, and the
duty of publishing an abstract of it on the return-
ing officer. Wharton.

## ELECTION CONTEST

one who has failed of success in election against
right of one who has been declared or determined

ial district. Appeal of Phillips, 262 Pa. 396, 105 A.
547, 548.

## ELECTION DOWER

to the provision which a law or statute makes for
a widow in case she "elects" to reject the provi-
sion made for her in the will and take what the

An estoppel predicated on a voluntary and intelligent
action or choice of one of several things which is incon-
sistent with another, the effect of the estoppel being to
prevent the party so choosing from afterwards reversing
his election or disputing the state of affairs or rights of
others resulting from his original choice. Yates v. Hurd,
8 Colo. 343, 8 Pac. 575.
The doctrine of "estoppel by election" against benefici-
ary who has elected to take favorable provisions of will
from objecting to other provisions of will applies only
where will undertakes to bestow a gift and also deprive
donee of a prior existing right, thus confronting devisee
with alternative of accepting devise and renouncing prior
right or of retaining latter and renouncing devise. Mason
& Mason v. Brown, Tex.Civ.App., 182 S.W.2d 729, 733.

have her name put on a jury list, in view of a
state constitution and statute. People v. Barnett,
319 Ill. 403, 150 N.E. 290, 291.

tled to vote, whereas "voters" appropriately designates
only those actually voting. State ex rel. Chaney v. Grin-

of some for that reason. "This barbarism jars the unhappy
latinist's nerves much more cruelly than the operation
denoted jars those of its victim." Fowler, Dict. of Mod.
English Usage (1926), p. 130. "To one having even an ele-
mentary knowledge of Latin grammar this word is no less
than disgusting, and the thing meant by it is felt to be
altogether too good for the word's inventor." Bierce,
Write it Right (1909), p. 24. It is not included in the New
English Dict. (Oxford, 1897), but is listed without comment
in the New Cent. Diet. (1927) and also in Funk & Wag-

lished use, though formerly much criticized from the
learned point of view because of the manner of its forma-
tion." Krapp, Comprehensive Guide to Good English

Taken in the king's court. It is so called because it
is in the choice or election of the plaintiff whether

fendant's goods and chattels are appraised and
all of them (except oxen and beasts of the plow)
are delivered to the plaintiff, at such reasonable

moiety of his freehold lands, which he had at the
time of the judgment given, are also to be deliv-
ered to the plaintiff, to hold till out of the rents
and profits thereof the debt be levied, or till the
defendant's interest be expired. During this per-
iod the plaintiff is called "tenant by elegit," and
his estate, an "estate by elegit." This writ, or
its analogue, is in use in some of the United
States, as Virginia and Kentucky. See 3 Bl.

Cas.1917B, 293. The same is true of water. Mills

## EMBARGO

A proclamation or order of state,
usually issued in time of war or threatened hos-
tilities, prohibiting the departure of ships or goods
from some or all the ports of such state until
further order. The William King, 2 Wheat. 148,
4 L.Ed. 206. For the use of the term as applied
in a loose sense to the government's control of
coal exports during a strike, see Ernesto Foglino
& ,Co. v. Webster, 216 N.Y.S. 225, 237, 217 App.Div.
Embargo is the hindering or detention by any govern-
ment of ships of commerce in its ports. If the embargo is
laid upon ships belonging to citizens of the state imposing
It, it is called a "civil embargo;" if, as more commonly
happens, it is laid upon ships belonging to the enemy, it is
called a "hostile embargo." The effect of this latter
embargo is that the vessels detained are restored to the
rightful owners if no war follows, but are forfeited to the
embargoing government if war does follow, the declara-
tion of war being held to relate back to the original seizure
and detention. Brown.
The temporary or permanent sequestration of
the property of individuals for the purposes of a

jejunii" are of great antiquity in the church. They
are observed on Wednesday, Friday, and Satur-
day next after Quadragesima Sunday, or the first
Sunday in Lent, after Whitsuntide, Holyrood Day,
in September, and St. Lucy's Day, about the mid-
dle of December. Brit. c. 53. Our almanacs call
the weeks in which they fall the "Ember Weeks,"
and they are now chiefly noticed on account of
the ordination of priests and deacons; because the
canon appoints the Sundays next after the Ember
weeks for the solemn times of ordination, though
the bishops, if they please, may ordain on any
Sunday or holiday. Enc. Lond.

## EMBEZZLEMENT

Co. v. U. S. Fidelity & Guaranty Co., 261 Mich.
221, 246 N.W. 71.
Embezzlement is not an offense at common law, but was
created by statute. "Embezzle" includes in its meaning
appropriation to one's own use, and therefore the use of
the single word "embezzle," in the indictment or informa-
tion, contains within itself the charge that the defendant
appropriated the money or property to his own use. State
v. Wolff, 34 La.Ann. 1153; State v. Hudson, 93 W.Va. 435,
117 S.E. 122, 125.
Embezzlement is common-law larceny extended by stat-
ute to cover cases where the stolen property comes orig-
inally into the possession of the defendant without a tres-
pass. Moody v. People, 65 Colo. 339, 176 P. 476.
Embezzlement is a species of larceny, and the term is
applicable to cases of furtive and fraudulent appropriation
by clerks, servants, or carriers of property coming into
their possession by virtue of their employment. It is dis-
tinguished from "larceny," properly so called, as being
committed in respect of property which is not at the time
in the actual or legal possession of the owner. That is to
say, that in embezzlement the original taking of the prop-
erty was lawful or with the consent of the owner, while in
larceny the felonious intent must have existed at the time
of the taking. Tredwell v. U. S., C.C.A.Va., 266 F. 350,
352. Both words, however, may be used, as in a bond, as
generic terms to indicate the dishonest and fraudulent
breach of any duty or obligation upon the part of an
employee to pay over to his employer, or account to him
for any money, securities, or other personal property, title
to which is in the employer, but which may come into the
possession of the employee. National Surety Co. v. Wil-
liams, 74 Fla. 446, 77 So. 212, 222. Under statute declaring
guilty of a felony an officer or clerk of a state bank who
"embezzles, abstracts, or willfully misapplies" its funds,
"embezzle" refers to acts done for the benefit of the actor
as against the bank, "misapply" covers acts having no
relation to pecuniary profit or advantage to the doer, while
"abstract" means only to take and withdraw from the pos-
session and control of the bank; and while "embezzle-.
ment" may include the offenses of abstraction and willful
misapplication, either of those offenses may be committed
without embezzlement. Ferguson v. State, 80 Tex.Cr.R.
383, 189 S.W. 271, 273. See, however, Winkelmann v. State,
114 Neb. 1, 205 N.W. 565, 566.

## EMBLEMATA TRIBONIANI

In the Roman law.
Alterations, modifications, and additions to the
writings of the older jurists, selected to make up
the body of the Pandects, introduced by Tribon-
ian and his associates who constituted the com-
mission appointed for that purpose, with a view
to harmonize contradictions, exscind obsolete mat-
ter, and make the whole conform to the law as
understood in Justinian's time, were called by this
name. Mackeld. Rom. Law, § 71.

## EMBLEMENTS

The vegetable chattels called
"emblements" are the corn and other growth of
the earth which are produced annually, not spon-
taneously, but by labor and industry, and thence
are called "fructus industriales." Reiff v. Reiff,
64 Pa. 137. See Crop.
The growing crops of those vegetable productions of the
soil which are annually produced by the labor of the culti-
vator. They are deemed personal property, and pass as
such to the executor or administrator of the occupier,
whether he were the owner in fee, or for life, or for years,
if he die before he has actually cut, reaped, or gathered
the same; and this, although, being affixed to the soil,
they might for some purposes be considered, while grow-
ing, as part of the realty. Wharton.
The term also denotes the right of a tenant to
take and carry away, after his tenancy has ended,
such annual products of the land as have resulted
from his own care and labor.
Emblements are the away-going crop; in other words,
the crop which is upon the ground and unreaped when the
tenant goes away, his lease having determined; and the
right to emblements is the right in the tenant to take away
the away-going crop, and for that purpose to come upon
the land, and do all other necessary things thereon. Miller
v. Gray, Tex.Civ.App., 108 S.W.2d 265, 267, 268.
Where a life tenant, having leased the premises, died,
and the remainderman did not recognize the lease, the
lessee of the life tenant was entitled to the emblements,
which are the crops of grain growing yearly, but requiring
an outlay of labor or industry, without payment of any
compensation for use of the land in harvesting the emble-
ments. Turner v. Turner, 132 Tenn. 592, 179 S. W. 132, 133.

## EMBLERS DE GENTZ

L. Fr. A stealing from
the people. The phrase occurs in the old rolls of
parliament: 'Whereas divers murders, emblers
de gentz, and robberies are committed," etc.

## EMBOLISM

In medical jurisprudence. The me-
chanical obstruction of an artery or capillary by
some body traveling in the blood current, as, a
blood-clot (embolus), a globule of fat or an air-
bubble.
Embolism is to be distinguished from "thrombosis," a
thrombus being a clot of blood formed in the heart or a
blood vessel in consequence of some impediment of the
circulation from pathological causes, as distinguished from
mechanical causes, for example, an alteration of the blood
or walls of the blood vessels. When embolism occurs in
the brain (called "cerebral embolism") there is more or
less coagulation of the blood in the surrounding parts, and
there may be apoplectic shock or paralysis of the brain,
and its functional activity may be so far disturbed as to
cause entire or partial insanity. See Cundall v. Haswell,
23 R.I. 508, 51 A. 426.

## EMBOLUS

In case of wounds is a product of
coagulation of the blood or blood clot. Berryhill
v. Nichols, 171 Miss. 769, 158 So. 470. A plug
which floats along until it becomes lodged so as
to obstruct the passage of the blood. It consists
usually of a clot or fibrin, a shred from a morbid
growth, a globule of fat, air bubbles, or a micro-
organism. An embolus or floating particle by
attaching itself or becoming wedged may form a
thrombosis or occlusion. Norris v. Industrial
Commission, 90 Utah 256, 61 P.2d 413, 414.

## EMBRACEOR

A person guilty of the offense of
embracery (q. v.). See Co. Litt. 369.

## EMBRACERY

In criminal law. This offense
consists in the attempt to influence a jury corrupt-
ly to one side or the other, by promises, persua-
sions, entreaties, entertainments, douceurs, and
the like. The person guilty of it is called an "em-
braceor." Moss v. Arnold, 63 Okla.Cr. 343, 75 P.2d
491, 503; Commonwealth v. Fahey, 113 Pa.Super.
598, 173 A. 854, 856.
Embracery being but an attempt corruptly to influence
juror, there is no such crime as attempt to commit
embracery. Wiseman v. Commonwealth, 143 Va. 631, 130
S.E. 249, 251.

## EMENDA

Amends; something given in repara-
tion for a trespass; or, in old Saxon times, in
compensation for an injury or crime. Spelman.

## EMENDALS

An old word still made use of in
the accounts of the society of the Inner Temple,
where so much in emendals at the foot of an ac-
count on the balance thereof signifies so much
money in the bank or stock of the houses, for
reparation of losses, or other emergent occasions.
Spelman.

## EIVICENDARE

In Saxon law. To make amends
or satisfaction for any crime or trespass commit-
ted; to pay a fine; to be fined. Spelman. Emen-
dare se, to redeem, or ransom one's life, by pay-
EMENDATIO. In old English law. Amendment,
or correction. The power of amending and cor-
recting abuses, according to certain rules and
measures. Cowell.

## EMERGENCY

A sudden unexpected happening;
an unforeseen occurrence or condition; specifical-
ly, perplexing contingency or complication of cir-
cumstances; a sudden or unexpected occasion for
action; exigency; pressing necessity.
A relatively permanent condition of insufficien-
cy of service or of facilities resulting in social dis-
turbance or distress. Kardasinksi v. Koford, 88
N.H. 444, 190 A. 702, 703, 111 A.L.R. 1017; Con-
tract Cartage Co. v. Morris, D.C.I11., 59 F.2d 437,
446; Los Angeles Dredging Co. v. City of Long
Beach, 210 Cal. 348, 291 P. 839, 843, 71 A.L.R. 161.
"Emergency" in sense of constitutional provision respect-
ing referendum does not mean expediency, convenience, or
best interest. State v. Hinkle, 161 Wash. 652, 297 P. 1071,
EMERGENCY EMPLOYMENT DOCTRINE. A
regularly employed servant possesses implied ati-,
thority to engage an assistant to aid in perform-
ing a task, within scope of servant's duties in case
of emergency rendering it absolutely necessary to
obtain such assistance, and without which emer-
gency conditions could not be overcome by serv-
ant or any of his coemployees in regular service
of their common master. Hall v. 0. C. Whitaker
Co., 143 Tex. 397, 185 S.W.2d 720, 722, 723.

## EMERGENCY LANDING AREA

Any area that
a plane could possibly be landed into with or with-
out motor. It should be from five hundred to a
thousand feet in length, depending on obstructions

it should be at least two or three times that of
plane. Shaw v. Carson, 218 Iowa 1251, 257 N.W.

## EMERGENT YEAR

The epoch or date whence
any people begin to compute their time.

## EMIGRANT

country or state to another.
It is to be distinguished from "expatriation."

Emigration is also used of the removal from one
section to another of the same country.

## EMINENCE

An honorary title given to car-
dinals. They were called "illustrissimi" and "re-
verendissimi" until the pontificate of Urban VIII.

## EMINENT DOMAIN

The power to take private
property for public use. MacVeagh v. Multon-
omah County, 126 Or. 417, 270 P. 502, 507.
The right of eminent domain is the right of the
state, through its regular organization, to reas-
sert, either temporarily or permanently, its do-
minion over any portion of the soil of the state on
account of public exigency and for the public
good. Thus, in time of war or insurrection, the
proper authorities may possess and hold any part
of the territory of the state for the common safe-
ty; and in time of peace the legislature may au-
thorize the appropriation of the same to public
purposes, such as the opening of roads, construc-
tion of defenses, or providing channels for trade
or travel.
The right of society, or of the sovereign, to dispose, in
case of necessity, and for the public safety, of all the
wealth contained in the state, is called "eminent domain."
Jones v. Walker, 2 Paine, 688, Fed.Cas.No.7,507.
Eminent domain is the highest and most exact idea of
property remaining in the government, or in the aggregate
body of the people in their sovereign capacity. It gives a
right to resume the possession of the property in the man-
ner directed by the constitution and the laws of the state,
whenever the public interest requires it. Beekman v. Sara-
toga & S. R. Co., 3 Paige, N.Y., 45, 73, 22 Am. Dec. 679.
"The exaction of money from individuals under the right
of taxation, and the appropriation of private property for
public use by virtue of the power of eminent domain, must
not be confused. In paying taxes the citizen contributes
his just and ascertained share to the expenses of the gov-
ernment under which he lives. But when his property is
taken under the power of eminent domain, he is compelled
to surrender to the public something above and beyond his
due proportion for the public benefit. The matter is spe-
cial. It is in the nature of a compulsory sale to the state."
Black, Tax-Titles, § 3; Beeland Wholesale Co. v. Kaufman,
234 Ala. 249, 174 So. 516, 520.
The term "eminent domain" is sometimes (but inac-
curately) applied to the land, buildings, etc., owned
directly by the government, and which have not yet passed
into any private ownership. This species of property is
much better designated as the "public domain," or
"national domain."
EMISSARY. A person sent upon a mission as the
agent of another; also a secret agent sent to as-
certain the sentiments and designs of others, and
to propagate opinions favorable to his employer.

## EMISSION

In medical jurisprudence. The ejec-
tion or throwing out of any secretion or other
matter from the body; the expulsion of urine,
semen, etc.

## EMIT

To put forth or send out; to issue. "No
state shall emit bills of credit." Const. U. S. art.
1, § 10.
To issue; to give forth with authority; to put
The word "emit" is never employed in describing those
contracts by which a state binds itself to pay money at a
future day for services actually received, or for money
borrowed for present use. Nor are instruments executed
for such purposes, in common language, denominated "bills
of credit." "To emit bills of credit" conveys to the mind
the idea of issuing paper intended to circulate through the
community, for its ordinary purposes, as money, which
paper is redeemable at a future day. Briscoe v. Bank of
Kentucky, 11 Pet. 316, 9 L.Ed. 709.
To throw off; give out; discharge. Alabama
Great Southern R. Co. v. Stewart, 15 Ala.App. 466,
73 So. 827, 828.
In Scotch practice. To speak out; to state in
words. A prisoner is said to emit a declaration.
2 Alis.Crim.Pr. 560.

## EMMENAGOGUES

In medical jurisprudence.
The name of a class of medicines supposed to
have the property of promoting the menstrual
discharge, and sometimes used for the purpose of
procuring abortion.

## EMOLUMENT

The profit arising from office or
employment; that which is received as a compen-
sation for services, or which is annexed to the
possession of office as salary, fees, and perqui-
sites; advantage; gain, public or private. Web-
ster. Any perquisite, advantage, profit, or gain
arising from the possession of an office. Apple v.
Crawford County, 105 Pa. 303, 51 Am.Rep. 205;
United States v. MacMillan, D.C.I11., 209 F. 266,
272; McLean v. United States, 3 S.Ct. 122, 124,
226 U.S. 374, 57 L.Ed. 260; State ex rel. Todd v.
Reeves, 196 Wash. 145, 82 P.2d 173, 175, 118 A.L.R.

## EMOTIONAL INSANITY

The species of mental
aberration produced by a violent excitement of
the emotions or passions, though the reasoning
faculties may remain unimpaired. A passion, ef-
fecting for a space of time complete derange-
ment of accused's intellect, or an impulse, which
his mind is not able to resist, to do the act. Fan-
non v. Commonwealth, 295 Ky. 817, 175 S.W.2d
531, 533. See Insanity.

the fundament. Enc. Lond.

## EMPANNEL

See Impanel.

## EMPARLANCE

## EMPARNOURS

L. Fr. Undertakers of suits.
Kelham.

## EMPEROR

The title of the sovereign ruler of
an empire. This designation was adopted by the
rulers of the Roman world after the decay of the
republic, and was assumed by those who claimed
to be their successors in the "Holy Roman Em-
pire," as also by Napoleon. "The sovereigns of
Japan and Morocco are often, though with little
propriety, called emperors." 10 Encyc. Amer.
(1929), p. 300. In western speech the former sover-
eigns of Turkey and China were called emperors.
Cent. Diet.
The title "emperor" seems to denote a power
pears to be the appropriate style of the executive
head of a federal government, constructed on the
monarchial principle, and comprising in its organi-
zation several distinct kingdoms or other quasi
sovereign states; as was the case with the Ger-
man empire from 1871 to 1918. "The proper mean-
ing of emperor is the chief of a confederation of
states of which kings are members." Cent. Dict.,
quoting Encyc. Brit. "In general, an emperor is
the holder of a sovereignty extending over con-
quered or confederated peoples, a king is ruler of
a single people. Thus * * * the 'King of Eng-
land' is 'Emperor of India.' " Webster's New
Int. Dict. Before the dissolution of the Austro-
Hungarian empire in November, 1918, its monarch
was known as the Emperor of Austria and King
of Hungary.

## EMPHASIZING FACTS

An instruction is said
to emphasis facts which may contain sufficient
facts to authorize a verdict, but nevertheless some
fact or facts are selected from the evidence and
mentioned in such a way as to indicate to the jury
that they have especial potency when that is not
justified. Robinson v. Ross, Mo., 47 S.W.2d 122,
EMPHYTEUSIS. In the Roman and civil law.
A contract by which a landed estate was leased
to a tenant, either in perpetuity or for a long
term of years, upon the reservation of an annual
rent or canon, and upon the condition that the
lessee should improve the property, by building,
cultivating, or otherwise, and with a right in the
lessee to alien the estate at pleasure or pass it to
his heirs by descent, and free from any revoca-
tion, re-entry, or claim of forfeiture on the part of
the grantor, except for non-payment of the rent.
Inst. 3, 25, 3; 3 Bl.Comm. 232; Maine, Anc. Law,
The right granted by such a contract, (jus em-
phyteuticum, or emphyteuticarium.) The real
right by which a person is entitled to enjoy an-
other's estate as if it were his own, and to dis-
pose of its substance, as far as can be done with-
out deteriorating it. Mackeld. Rom. Law, § 326.

## EMPHYTEUTA

In the civil law. The person to
whom an emphyteusis is granted; the lessee or
tenant under a contract of emphyteusis.

## EMPHYTEUTICUS

In the civil law. Founded
on, growing out of, or having the character of, an

mons or citation, issued by authority of a judge,
requiring the person to whom it is addressed to

purchaser to see that the price is so reinvested.
Arg. Fr. Mere. Law, 557.

## EMPLOY

To engage in one's service; to use
as an agent or substitute in transacting business;
to commission and intrust with the management
of one's affairs; and, when used in respect to a
servant or hired laborer, the term is equivalent to
hiring, which implies a request and a contract for
a compensation, and has but this one meaning
when used in the ordinary affairs and business of
life. Tennessee Coal, Iron & R. Co. v. Muscoda
Local No. 123, Ala., 64 S.Ct. 698, 703, 705, 321 U.S.
590, 88 L.Ed. 949; Slocum Straw Works v. Indus-
trial Commission, 232 Wis. 71, 286 N.W. 593, 598;
It is a synonym of "appoint". Morris v. Parks,

mous with "hire." Nat. Wooden Box Ass'n v.
U. S., Ct.C1., 103 Ct.C1. 595, 59 F.Supp. 118, 119.

## EMPLOYED

This signifies both the act of doing
a thing and the being under contract or orders to
do it. To give employment to; to have employ-
ment. State v. Birmingham Beauty Shop, Ala.,
198 So. 435, 436.

## EMPLOYEE

This word "is from the French,
but has become somewhat naturalized in our
language. Strictly and etymologically, it means
`a person employed,' but, in practice in the French
language, it ordinarily is used to signify a person
in some official employment, and as generally
used with us, though perhaps not confined to any
official employment, it is understood to mean some
permanent employment or position." The word
may be more extensive than "clerk" or "officer,"
and may signify any one in place, or having
charge or using a function, as well as one in of-
fice. Hopkins v. Cromwell, 89 App.Div. 481, 85
N.Y.S. 839.
One who works for an employer; a person
working for salary or wages; applied to anyone
so working, but usually only to clerks, workmen,
laborers, etc., and but rarely to the higher officers
of a corporation or government or to domestic
servants. Keefe v. City of Monroe, 120 So. 106, 9
La.App. 545; State ex rel. Gorczyca v. City of
Minneapolis, 174 Minn. 594, 219 N.W. 924.
Generally, when person for whom services are
performed has right to control and direct indi-
vidual who performs services not only as to re-
sult to be accomplished by work but also as to
details and means by which result is accom-
ployee". Young v. Demos, 70 Ga.App. 577, 28 S.E.
2d 891, 893.
"Servant" is synonymous with "employee".
Gooden v. Mitchell, Del.Super., 21 A.2d 197, 200,

Transport, Tex.Civ.App., 138 S.W.2d 293, 294. Ten-
nessee Valley Appliances v. Rowden, 24 Tenn.
App. 487 146 S.W.2d 845, 848.
"Employee" must be distinguished from "independent
contractor," "officer," "vice-principal," "agent," etc. The
term is often specially defined by statutes ; and whether
one is an employee or not within a particular statute will
depend upon facts and circumstances. For examples; Fair
Labor Standards Act, Fleming v. Demeritt Co., D.C.Vt., 56
F.Supp. 376, 378, 390; Schroepfer v. A. S. Abell Co.,

One who employs the services of
others; one for whom employees work and who
pays their wages or salaries. The correlative of
employee." Angell v. White Eagle Oil & Refin-
ing Co., 169 Minn. 183, 210 N.W. 1004, 1005. "Mas-
ter" is a synonymous term. Tennessee Valley

P.2d 314, 317.

sovereign power to, and the possession of it by, the person
filling the office, while an "employment" does not compre-
hend a delegation of any part of the sovereign authority.
Dade County v. State, 95 Fla. 465, 116 So. 72, 76.

and house of representatives of the United States
of America in congress assembled," "The general
assembly do enact," etc. A section of a statute
denouncing an offense is sometimes spoken of as
the "enacting clause." City of Astoria v. Malone,

dimension, where it crosses the vein, while the
"side lines" are those which mark its longer
dimension, where it follows the course of the vein.
But with reference to extra-lateral rights, if the
claim as a whole crosses the vein, instead of fol-
lowing its course, the end lines will become side
lines and vice versa. Consolidated Wyoming
Gold Min. Co. v. Champion Min. Co., C.C.Cal., 63
F. 549.

## END OF WILL

tive provisions terminate. In re Levanti's Will,

co, C.C.A.Mass., 283 F. 890, 893.

## END SILLS

The sill of a car is one of the main
longitudinal timbers which are connected trans-
versely by the end sills, bolsters, and cross-ties.
Sills are divided into side sills, intermediate sills,
and center sills. The end sill is the transverse
member of the under frame of a car framed
across the ends of all the longitudinal sills. In
passenger cars the end sill comes directly under
the end door; the platform with its various parts
usually being a separate construction. The plat-
form end sill is the transverse end piece of the
platform frame, and is also called the "end tim-
ber" and buffer beam on passenger equipment
cars. Hill v. Minneapolis, St. P. & S. S. M. Ry. Co.,
160 Minn. 484, 200 N.W. 485, 486.

## END TO END

The expression "end to end,"
used in a patent claim in describing the relative
position of rollers, does not necessarily require
that there shall be no longitudinal space between
the ends of the rollers, nor impose a limitation
which will enable another to avoid infringement
by leaving a space between them, where it does
not change their function or mode of operation.
Stebler v. Riverside Heights Orange Growers'
Ass'n, C.C.A.Cal., 205 F. 735, 740.

## ENDEAVOR

known as "endowed schools;" and a series of
acts of parliament regulating them are known as
the "endowed schools acts." Mozley & Whitley.

## ENDOWMENT

The assignment of dower; the
setting off a woman's dower. 2 Bl. Comm. 135.
In appropriations of churches (in English law,)
the setting off a sufficient maintenance for the
vicar in perpetuity. 1 Bl. Comm. 387.
The act of settling a fund, or permanent pecun-
iary provision, for the maintenance of a public
institution, charity, college, etc.
A fund settled upon a public institution, etc.,
for its maintenance or use.
The words "endowment" and "fund," in a statute
exempting from taxation the real estate, the furniture and
personal property, and the "endowment or fund" of reli-
gious and educational corporations, are ejusdem generic,
and intended to comprehend a class of property different
from the other two, not real estate or chattels. The dif-
ference between the words is that "fund" is a general
term, including the endowment, while "endowment" means
that particular fund, or part of the fund, of the institution,
bestowed for its more permanent uses, and usually kept
sacred for the purposes intended. The word "endowment"
does not, in such an enactment, include real estate. See
First Reformed Dutch Church v. Lyon, 32 N.J.Law, 360;
Appeal of Wagner Institute, 116 Pa. 555, 11 A. 402.

## ENDOWMENT POLICY

In life insurance. A
policy which is payable when the insured reaches
a given age, or upon his decease, if that occurs
earlier. Central States Life Ins. Co. v. Morris,
202 Ark. 969, 155 S.W.2d 333, 336, 202 Ark. 969.

## ENDURANCE

continuance; or act or instance of bearing or
suffering; a continuing or the power of continu-
ing under pain, hardship, or distress without being
overcome; sufferance; as beyond endurance.
State ex rel. Adams v. Crowder, 46 N.M. 20, 120
P.2d 428, 431.
ENEMY, in public law, signifies either the state
which is at war with another, or a citizen or sub-
ject of such state, or a person, partnership, or
corporation doing business within the territory of
an enemy state or an ally thereof. United States
v. Fricke, D.C.N.Y., 259 F. 673, 675; Rossie v.
Garvan, D.C.Conn., 274 F. 447, 453.
Alien Enemy
An alien, that is, a citizen or subject of a for-
eign state or power, residing within a given coun-
try, is called an "alien ami" if the country
where he lives is at peace with the country
of which he is a citizen or subject; but if a state
of war exists between the two countries, he is
called an "alien enemy," and in that character is
denied access to the courts or aid from any of the
departments of government.
Enemy Belligerent
Citizens who associate themselves with the mili-
tary arm of an enemy government and enter the
United States bent on hostile acts. Ex parte Quir-
in, App.D.C., 63 S.Ct. 2, 15, 317 U.S. 1, 87 L.Ed. 3.
Enemy's Property
In international law, and particularly in the
usage of prize courts, this term designates any
property which is engaged or used in illegal in-
tercourse with the public enemy, whether belong-
ing to an ally or a citizen, as the illegal traffic
stamps it with the hostile character and attaches
to it all the penal consequences. Prize Cases, 2
Black, 674, 17 L.Ed. 459.
Public Enemy
A nation at war with the United States; also
every citizen or subject of such nation. Not in-
cluding robbers, thieves, private depredators, or
riotous mobs. State v. Moore, 74 Mo. 417, 41 Am.
Rep. 322.
The term has latterly acquired, in the vocab
ulary of journalism and civic indignation, a more
extended meaning, denoting a particularly notor-
ious offender against the criminal laws, especially
one who seems more or less immune from suc-
cessful prosecution.

## ENFEOFF

ment. To make a gift of any corporeal heredita-

fine; to compel obedience to. Dozier v. City of
Gatesville, Tex.Civ.App., 51 S.W.2d 1091.

## ENFORCEABLE

Word "enforceable," standing
alone, does not mean "perform" or "performable,"
but, when employed in contract for performance
of obligation relating to venue, it is synonymous
with word "execute," and must be given meaning
of "perform," "performable," and "to perform."
It does not necessarily imply actual force or co-
ercion, but may mean to be executed; to put
into execution; to cause to take effect. Glover v.
American Mortgage Corporation, Tex.Civ.App., 94
S.W.2d 1235, 1236.

## ENFRANCHISE

To make free; to incorporate
a man in a society or body politic.

## ENFRANCHISEMENT

The act of making free;
giving a franchise or freedom to; investiture with
privileges or capacities of freedom, or municipal
or political liberty. Admission to the freedom of
a city; admission to political rights, and particu-
larly the right of suffrage. Anciently, the acquisi-
tion of freedom by a villein from his lord.
The word is now used principally either of
the manumission of slaves, (q. v.,) of giving to a
borough or other constituency a right to return a
member or members to parliament, or of the
conversion of copyhold into freehold. Mozley &
Whiteley.

## ENFRANCHISEMENT OF COPYHOLDS

In
English law. The conversion of copyhold into
freehold tenure, by a conveyance of the fee-simple
of the property from the lord of the manor to the
copyholder, or by a release from the lord of all
seigniorial rights, etc., which destroys the custom-
ary descent, and also all rights and privileges an-
nexed to the copyholder's estate. 1 Watk. Copyh.
362; 2 Steph. Comm. 51.

## ENGAGE

To employ or involve one's self; to
take part in; to embark on. State ex rel. Kusie
v. Weber, 72 N.D. 705, 10 N.W.2d 741, 745. It im-
ports more than a single act or transaction or an
occasional participation. Head v. New York Life
Ins. Co., C.C.A.Okl., 43 F.2d 517, 519; Lee v.
Guardian Life Ins. of America, 46 N.Y.S.2d 241,
246, 187 Misc. 221.
"Engage" means to take part in or be employed in and
denotes more than a single act or single transaction while
"participate" means simply to take or have a part or share
in, and may apply equally to a single act or many acts.
Lawyers Lloyds of Texas v. Webb, Tex.Civ.App., 150
S.W.2d 181, 184.
ENGAGED IN AVIATION, See Aviation.

## ENGAGED IN COMMERCE

To be "engaged in
commerce" an employee must be actually engaged
in the movement of commerce or the services he
performs must be so closely related thereto as to
be for all practical purposes an essential part
thereof; McLeod v. Threlkeld, Tex., 63 S.Ct. 1248,
1251, 1252, 319 U.S. 491, 87 L.Ed. 1538; Boutell v.
Walling, C.C.A.Mich., 148 F.2d 329, 331.

## ENGAGED IN EMPLOYMENT

To be rendering
service for employer under terms of employment,
and is more than being merely hired to commence
work. Walling v. Consumers Co., C.C.A.Ill., 149
F.2d 626, 629.

## ENGA GEMENT

In French law. A contract.
The obligation arising from a quasi contract.
The terms "obligation" and "engagement" are
said to be synonymous, (17 Toullier, no. 1;) but
the Code seems specially to apply the term "en-
ga gement" to those obligations which the law im-
poses on a man without the intervention of. any
contract, either on the part of the obligor or the
obligee, (article 1370.) An engagement to do or
omit to do something amounts to a promise. Rue
v. Rue, 21 N.J.Law, 369.
In English practice. The term has been appro-
priated to denote a contract entered into by a
married woman with the intention of binding or
charging her separate estate, or, with stricter ac-
curacy, a promise which in the case of a person
sui juris would be a contract, but in the case of
a married woman is not a contract, because she
cannot bind herself personally, even in equity.
Her engagements, therefor, merely operate as
dispositions or appointments pro tanto of her
separate estate. Sweet.
Under statute rendering national bank stock-
holders liable to assessment in order to discharge
an "engagement" of the bank, the quoted word
includes all pecuniary liabilities and obligations of
the bank. Oppenheimer v. Harriman Nat. Bank
& Trust Co. of City of New York, N.Y., 57 S.Ct.
719, 723, 301 U.S. 206, 81 L.Ed. 1042.

## ENGENDER

To cause, to bring about, to excite,
to occasion, to call forth. Lacy v. State, 30 Okl.
Cr. 273, 236 P. 53, 54.

## ENGINE

This is said to be a word of very gen-
eral signification; and, when used in an act, its
meaning must be sought out from the act itself,
and the language which surrounds it, and also
from other acts in pari materia, in which it oc-
curs. Abbott, J., 6 Maule & S. 192. In a large
sense, it applies to all utensils and tools which
afford the means of carrying on a trade. But in
a more limited sense it means a thing of consider-
able dimensions, of a fixed or permanent nature,
analogous to an erection or building. Id. 182.
And see Lefler v. Forsberg, 1 App.D.C. 41; Brown
v. Benson, 101 Ga. 753, 29 S.E. 215.
Within Employers' Liability Law, § 1, par. 2,
subd. (a), an "engine" is an ingenious or skillful
contrivance used to effect a purpose, and is often
synonymous with the word "machine"; machine-
ry being any combination of mechanical means

diameter, where it still has sufficient expansive
force to drive another piston. This operation may

## ENTAIL

A fee abridged or limited to the is-
sue, or certain classes of issue, instead of descend-
ing to all the heirs. 1 Washb. Real Prop. 66;
Cowell; 2 Bl.Comm. 112, note.
Entail, in legal treatises, is used to signify an estate tail,
especially with reference to the restraint which such an
estate imposes upon its owner, or, in other words, the
points wherein such an estate differs from an estate in fee-
simple. And this is often its popular sense; but some-
times it is, in popular language, used differently, so as to
signify a succession of life-estates, as when it is said that
"an entail ends with A.," meaning that A. is the first per-
son who is entitled to bar or cut off the entail, being in
law the first tenant in tail. Mozley & Whiteley.
Break or Bar an Entail
To free an estate from the limitations imposed
by an entail, and permit its free disposition, an-
ciently by means of a fine or common recovery,
but now by deed in which the tenant and next
Quasi Entail
An estate pur autre vie may be granted, not
only to a man and his heirs, but to a man and
the heirs of his body, which is termed a "quasi
entail;" the interest so granted not being proper-
ly an estate-tail, (for the statute De Donis applies
only where the subject of the entail is an estate
of inheritance,) but yet so far in the nature of an
estate-tail that it will go to the heir of the body
as special occupant during the life of the cestui
que vie, in the same manner as an estate of in-
heritance would descend, if limited to the grantee
and the heirs of his body. Wharton.

## ENTAILED

Settled or limited to specified heirs,
or in tail.

## ENTAILED MONEY

Money directed to be in-
vested in realty to be entailed. 3 & 4 Wm. IV, c.
74, §§ 70, 71, 72.

## ENTAILMENT

An interference with and cur-
tailment of the ordinary rules pertaining to dev-
olution by inheritance; a limitation and direc-
tion by which property is to descend different
from the course which it would take if the creator
of the entailment, grantor or testator, had been
content that the estate should devolve in regular
and general succession to heirs at law in the statu-
tory order of precedence and sequence. Gardner
v. Anderson, 114 Kan. 778, 227 P. 743, 748.

## ENTENCION

In old English law. The plaintiff's
count or declaration.

## ENTENDMENT

The old form of intendment (q.
v.) derived directly from the French, and used to
denote the true meaning or signification of a word
or sentence; that is, the understanding or con-
struction of law. Cowell.

## ENTER

To form a constituent part, to become
a part or partaker; to impenetrate; share; with
into; as, tin enters into the composition of pew-
ter. Bedford v. Colorado Fuel & Iron Corpora-
tion, 102 Colo. 538, 81 P.2d 752, 755.
In the law of real property. To go upon land
for the purpose of taking possession of it. In
strict usage, the entering is preliminary to the
taking possession but in common parlance the en-
try is now merged in the taking possession. See
Entry.
In practice. To place anything before a court,
or upon or among the records, in a formal and
regular manner, and usually in writing; as to "en-
ter an appearance," to "enter a judgment." In
this sense the word is nearly equivalent to setting
down formally in writing, in either a full or
abridged form.

## ENTERCEUR

L. Fr. A party challenging
(claiming) goods; he who has placed them in the
hands of a third person. Kelham.

## ENTERING

Generally synonymous with "re-
cording". In re Labb, D.C.N.Y., 42 F.Supp. 542,
ENTERING JUDGMENTS. The formal entry of
the judgment on the rolls of the court, which is
necessary before bringing an appeal or an action
on the judgment. Blatchford v. Newberry, 100
Ill. 491. The entering of judgment is a ministerial
act performed by the clerk of court by means of
which permanent evidence of judicial act in ren-
dering judgment is made a record of the court.
Jones v. Sun Oil Co., Tex.Civ.App., 145 S.W.2d
615, 619. Under some statutes, the entering con-
sists merely in the filing of a judgment with the
clerk; Mathison v. Anderson, 107 Wash. 617, 182
P. 622. But under other acts, the entry of a judg-
ment consists in the recording of it in the judg-
ment book. Wilson v. Durkee, 20 Cal.App. 492,
129 P. 617, 618.
Entry of judgment differs from rendition of
judgment. "Rendition" of a judgment is the ju-
dicial act of the court in pronouncing the sentence
of the law upon the facts in controversy. The
"entry" is a ministerial act, which consists in
spreading upon the record a statement of the final
conclusion reached by the court in the matter, thus
furnishing external and incontestable evidence of
the sentence given, and designed to stand as a
perpetual memorial of its action. Jaqua v. Har-
kens, 40 Ind.App. 639, 82 N.E. 920, 922; Beet-
chenow v. Bartholet, 162 Wash. 119, 298 P. 335,
ENTERING SHORT. When bills not due are paid
into a bank by a customer, it is the custom of
some bankers not to carry the amount of the bills
directly to his credit, but to "enter them short,"
as it is called, i. e., to note down the receipt of the
bills, their amounts, and the times when they be-
come due in a previous column of the page, and
the amounts when received are carried forward
into the usual cash column. Sometimes, instead
of entering such bills short, bankers credit the
customer directly with the amount of the bills as
cash, charging interest on any advances they may
make on their account, and allow him at once to
draw upon them to that amount. If the banker
becomes bankrupt, the property in bills entered
short does not pass to his assignees, but the cus-
tomer is entitled to them if they remain in his
hands, or to their proceeds, if received, subject
to any lien the banker may have upon them.
Wharton.

## ENTERPRISE

A project or undertaking. Size-
more v. Hall, 148 Kan. 233, 80 P.2d 1092, 1095. In,
Workmen's Compensation Law. A hazardous un-
dertaking or project. Hahnemann Hospital v. In-
dustrial Board of Illinois, 282 Ill. 316, 118 N.E. 767,

with "board," and includes the ordinary neces-
saries' of life. See Lasar v. Johnson, 125 Cal. 549,
58 P. 161. Hospitable provision for the wants of
a guest, especially a provision for the table. That
which serves as amusement. Young v. Board of
Trustees of Broadwater County High School, 90
Mont. 576, 4 P.2d 725, 726.

## ENTHUSIASTS

than they can prove and can prove far more than
any one else can believe. Peskind v. State, 115
Ohio St. 279, 152 N.E. 670.

cure, allure, attract, draw by blandishment, coax
or seduce. Nash v. Douglass, 12 Abb.Prac.N.S.,
N.Y., 190. To lure, induce, tempt, incite, or per-
suade a person to do a thing. Berger v. Levy, 5
Cal.App.2d 544, 43 P.2d 610, 611.

## ENTIRE

Whole; without division, separation, or
diminution; unmingled; complete in all its parts;
not participated in by others. 15 Cyc. 1054; 11
Amer. & Eng. Enc. Law, 48; People v. Tahaures
Purchase, 26 N.Y.S.2d 795, 813.

## ENTIRE ACT

The words "entire Act" as used
in the rule of statutory construction that it is the
duty of the court to examine the entire act means
the caption, the body of the act, and the emergen-
cy clause. Anderson v. Penix, 138 Tex. 596, 161
S.W.2d 455, 459.

idue. In re Taylor's Estate, 86 A. 708, 711, 239

40 A.2d 156, 157.

## ENTIRE BLOOD

are those derived not only from the same ances-
tor, but from the same couple of ancestors. In
re Skidmore's Estate, 266 N.Y.S. 312, 148 Misc. 569.

## ENTIRE CONTRACT

See Contract.

## ENTIRE DAY

This phrase signifies an undivid-
ed day, not parts of two days. An entire day must
have a legal, fixed, precise time to begin, and a
fixed, precise time to end. A day, in contempla-
tion of law, comprises all the twenty-four hours,
beginning and ending at twelve o'clock at night.
Robertson v. State, 43 Ala. 325. In a statute re-
quiring the closing of all liquor saloons during
"the entire day of any election," etc., this phrase
means the natural day of twenty-four hours, com-
mencing and terminating at midnight. Haines v.
State, 7 Tex.App. 30.

## ENTIRE INTEREST

The whole interest or right,
without diminution. Where a person in selling his
tract of land sells also his entire interest in all
improvements upon public land adjacent thereto,
this vests in the purchaser only a quitclaim of his
interest in the improvements. McLeroy v. Duck-
worth, 13 La.Ann. 410.

## ENTIRE LOSS OF SIGHT

In respect of one eye,
or both. Substantial blindness, not necessarily
absolute. International Travelers' Ass'n v. Rog-
ers, Tex.Civ.App., 163 S.W. 421, 422. There was
"entire loss of sight" of eye within accident policy,
where insured could not distinguish one object
from another in the strongest light, though he
could distinguish between light and darkness.
Tracey v. Standard Acc. Ins. Co., 119 Me. 131, 109
A. 490, 494, 9 A.L.R. 521. Locomotive Engineers'
127 So. 699, 702. See Blind; Complete and Per-
manent Loss of Sight of Both Eyes.

## ENTIRE STRUCTURE

Under lien statute. Not
a completed, as distinguished from an uncomplet-
ed, building, but a new structure, not before exist-
ing, as distinguished from betterments and repairs
on previously constructed improvements. Atkin-
son v. Colorado Title & Trust Co., 59 Colo. 528,
151 P. 457, 461.

## ENTIRE TENANCY

A sole possession by one
person, called "severalty," which is contrary to
several tenancy, where a joint or common posses-
sion is in one or more.
ENTIRE USE, BENEFIT, etc. These words in
the habendum of a trust-deed for the benefit of a
married woman are equivalent to the words "sole
use," or "sole and separate use," and consequent-
ly her husband takes nothing under such deed.
Heathman v. Hall, 38 N.C. 414.

## ENTIRELY WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING

Ina-
bility to comprehend nature and effect of transac-
tion involved, not necessarily absolute imbecility,
idiocy or mental incapacity. Barlow v. Strange,
120 Ga. 1015, 1018, 48 S.E. 344.

## ENTIRETY

The whole, in contradistinction to
a moiety or part only. When land is conveyed
to husband and wife, they do not take by moie-
ties, but both are seised of the entirety. 2 Kent,
Comm. 132; 4 Kent, Comm. 362. Parceners, on
the other hand, have not an entirety of interest,
but each is properly entitled to the whole of a dis-
tinct moiety. 2 Bl.Comm. 188. See Estate by the
Entirety.
The word is also used to designate that which
the law considers as ,one whole, and not capable
of being divided into parts. Thus, a judgment,
it is held, is an entirety, and, if void as to one of
the two defendants, cannot be valid as to the oth-
er. So, if a contract is an entirety, no part of the
consideration is due until the whole has been per-
formed.

## ENTITLE

In its usual sense, to entitle is to give
a right or title. Felter v. McClure, 135 Wash. 410,
237 P. 1010, 1011. To qualify for; to furnish with
proper grounds for seeking or claiming. Fitts v.
Terminal Warehousing Corporation, 170 Tenn. 198,
93 S.W.2d 1265, 1267. In re Graves, 325 Mo. 888,
30 S.W.2d 149, 151. In ecclesiastical law. To en-
title is to give a title or ordination as a minister.

gate; an opening, and perhaps a passage. Wea-
therby v. Travelers Indemnity Co., Tex.Civ.App.,
ENTRAP. To catch, to entrap, to ensnare; hence,
to catch by artifice; to involve in difficulties or
distresses; to catch or involve in contradictions.
Roane v. State, 55 Okl.Cr. 332, 29 P.2d 990, 992.

## ENTRAPMENT

The act of officers or agents of
the government in inducing a person to commit
a crime not contemplated by him, for the purpose
of instituting a criminal prosecution against him.
Falden v. Commonwealth, 167 Va. 549, 189 S.E.
329, 332. Lee v. State, 66 Okl.Cr. 399, 92 P.2d 621,
623. But the mere act of an officer in furnishing
.
the accused an opportunity to commit the crime,
where the criminal intent was already present in
the accused's mind, is not ordinarily entrapment.
State v. Cowling, 161 Wash. 519, 297 P. 172, 174.

## ENTREATY

Beseeching, or suppliant, or prayer-
ful in nature. In re Sloan's Estate, 7 Cal.App.2d
319, 46 P.2d 1007, 1018.

tation to another country, without paying a duty.

by, D.C.Md., 2 F.Supp. 378, 379. Generally synony-
mous with "recording." In re Labb, D.C.N.Y., 42
F.Supp. 542, 544.

elers Indemnity Co., Tex.Civ.App., 171 S.W.2d 540,
In commercial law. Entry denotes the act of a.
merchant, trader, or other business man in re-
cording in his account-books the facts and circum-
stances of a sale, loan, or other transaction. Also
the note or record so made. Bissell v. Beckwith,
32 Conn. 517; U. S. v. Crecelius, D.C.Mo., 34 F. 30.
The books in which such memoranda are first (or
originally) inscribed are called "books of original
entry," and are prima facie evidence for certain
purposes.
In copyright law. Depositing with the register
of copyrights the printed title of a book, pamphlet,
etc., for the purpose of securing copyright on the

In real property law. Entry is the act of going
peaceably upon a piece of land which is claimed
as one's own, but is held by another person, with
the intention and for the purpose of taking posses-
sion of it.
Entry is a remedy which the law affords to an injured
party ousted of his lands by another person who has taken
possession thereof without right. This remedy (which
must in all cases be pursued peaceably) takes place in
three only out of the five species of ouster, viz., abatement,
intrusion, and disseisin; for, as in these three cases the
original entry of the wrong-doer is unlawful, so the wrong
may be remedied by the mere entry of the former posses-
sor. But it is otherwise upon a discontinuance or deforce-
ment, for in these latter two cases the former possessor
cannot remedy the wrong by entry, but must do so by
action, inasmuch as the original entry being in these cases
lawful, and therefore conferring an apparent right of pos-
session, the law will not suffer such apparent right to be
overthrown by the mere act or entry of the claimant.
Brown. Johnson v. Cobb, 29 S.C. 372, 7 S.E. 601.

Acts 1921, c. 112, § 138, provides that county court

60 days after such entry shall petition for assess-
ment of compensation. An "entry" within stat-
ute means the establishing of the road on, and ap-
propriation of, the land, by a proper order of the
county court. To effect an entry under the statute
it is not necessary that the county court go upon
the lands and begin the work of construction. Mc-

## ENTRY OF JUDGMENT

See Entering Judg-
ment.

## ENTRY ON THE ROLL

In former times, the
parties to an action, personally or by their coun-
sel, used to appear in open court and make their
mutual statements viva voce, instead of as at the
present day delivering their mutual pleadings, un-
til they arrived at the issue or precise point in
dispute between them. During the progress of
this oral statement, a minute of the various pro-
ceedings was made on parchment by an officer of
the court appointed for that purpose. The parch-
ment then became the record; in other words, the
official history of the suit. Long after the prac-
tice of oral pleading had fallen into disuse, it con-
tinued necessary to enter the proceedings in like
manner upon the parchment roll, and this was
called "entry on the roll," or making up the "issue
roll." But by a rule of H. T. 4 Wm. IV. the prac-
tice of making up the issue roll was abolished;
and it was only necessary to make up the issue in
the form prescribed for the purpose by a rule of
H. T. 1853, and to deliver the same to the court
and to the opposite party. The issue which was
delivered to the court was called the "nisi prius
record;" and that was regarded as the official
history of the suit, in like manner as the issue roll
formerly was. Under the present practice, the
issue roll or nisi prius record consists of the pa-
pers delivered to the court, to facilitate the trial of
the action, these papers consisting of the pleadings
simply, with the notice of trial. Brown.
ENTRY WITHOUT ASSENT OF THE CHAPTER.
A writ of entry sine assensu capituli lies where an
abbot, prior, or such as hath covent or common
seal, aliens lands or tenements of the right of his
church, without the assent of the covent or chap-
-ter, and dies. Termes de la Ley.

## ENTRY, WRIT OF

In old English practice. This
was a writ made use of in a form of real action
brought to recover the possession of lands from
one who wrongfully withheld the same from the
demandant.
Its object was to regain the possession of lands of which
the demandant, or his ancestors, had been unjustly
deprived by the tenant of the freehold, or those under
whom he claimed, and hence it belonged to the possessory
division of real actions. It decided nothing with respect
to the right of property, but only restored the demandant
to that situation in which he was (or by law ought to have
been) before the dispossession committed. 3 Bl.Comm. 180.
It was usual to specify in such writs the degree or
degrees within which the writ was brought, and it was
said to be "in the per" or "in the per and cui," according
as there had been one or two descents or alienations from
the original wrongdoer. If more than two such transfers
had intervened, the writ was said to be "in the post." See
3 Bl.Comm. 181. See, further, Writ of Entry.

## EPILEPSY

In medical jurisprudence. A disease
certain intervals between them. Vulgarly called
"fits." Westphall v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 27
Cal.App. 734, 151 P. 159, 182; Morse v. Caldwell,
55 Ga.App. 804, 191 S.E. 479, 485.
The disease is generally organic, though it may be func-
tional and symptomatic of irritation in other parts of the
body. The attack is characterized by loss of consciousness,
sudden falling down, distortion of the eyes and face, grind-
ing or gnashing of the teeth, stertorous respiration, and
more or less severe muscular spasms or convulsions. Epi-
lepsy, though a disease of the brain, is not to be regarded
as a form of insanity, in the sense that a person thus
afflicted can be said to be permanently insane, for there
may be little or no mental aberration in the intervals
between the attacks. But the paroxysm is frequently fol-
lowed by a temporary insanity, varying in particular
instances from slight alienation to the most violent mania.
In the latter form the affection is known as "epileptic
fury." But this generally passes off within a few days.
But the course of the principal disease is generally one of
deterioration, the brain being gradually more and more
deranged in its functions in the intervals of attack, and
the memory and intellectual powers in general becoming
enfeebled, leading to a greatly impaired state of mental
efficiency, or to dementia, or a condition bordering on
imbecility. See Aurentz v. Anderson, 3 Pittsb.R., Pa., 310;
Lawton v. Sun Mutual Ins. Co., 2 Cush., Mass., 517.
Hystero-epilepsy. A condition initiated by an ap-
parently mild attack of convulsive hysteria, fol-
lowed by an epileptiform convulsion, and suc-
ceeded by a period of "clownism" (Osler) in which
the patient assumes a remarkable series of droll
contortions or cataleptic poses, sometimes simulat-
ing attitudes expressive of various passions, as,
fear, joy, erotism, etc. The final stage is one of
delirium with unusual hallucinations. The attack
differs from true epilepsy in that the convulsions
may continue without serious result for several
successive days, while true epilepsy, if persistent,
is always serious, associated with fever, and fre-
quently fatal.

## EQUAL PROTECTION OF THE LAWS

The
equal protection of the laws of a state is extended
to persons within its jurisdiction, within the mean-
ing of the constitutional requirement, when its
courts are open to them on the same conditions as
to others, with like rules of evidence and modes
of procedure, for the security of their persons and
property, the prevention and redress of wrongs,
and the enforcement of contracts; when they are
subjected to no restrictions in the acquisition of
property, the -enjoyment of personal liberty, and
the pursuit -of happiness, which do not generally
affect others; when they are liable to no other or
greater burdens and charges than such as are laid
upon others; and when no different or greater
punishment is enforced against them for a viola-
tion of the laws. State v. Montgomery, 94 Me.
192, 47 A. 165.
"Equal protection of the law" means that equal protec-

risdiction of the board and reducing them to a
common and uniform basis, increasing or diminish-
ing by such percentage as may be necessary, so as
to bring about, within the entire territory affected,
a uniform and equal ratio between the assessed
value and the actual cash value of property. The
term is also applied to a similar process of leveling
or adjusting the assessments of individual taxpay-
ers, so that the property of one shall not be as-
sessed at a higher (or lower) percentage of its
market value than the property of another. See

208, 209.

## EQUITABLE

Just; conformable to the principles
of justice and right.
Just, fair, and right, in consideration of the
facts and circumstances of the individual case.
Existing in equity; available or sustainable only
in equity, or only upon the rules and principles
of equity.
As to "Fair and Equitable Value," see that title.
As to equitable "Assets," "Construction," "Conver-
sion," "Easement," "Ej ectment," "Estate," "Gar-
nishment," "Levy," "Mortgage," "Title," and
"Waste." see those titles.

## EQUITABLE ACTION

One founded on an equity
or cognizable in a court of equity; or, more spe-
cifically, an action arising, not immediately from
the contract in suit, but from an equity in favor
of a third person, not a party to it, but for whose
benefit certain stipulations or promises were made.
Wenzel & Henoch Const. Co. v. Metropolitan Water
Dist. of Southern California, D.C.Cal., 18 F.Supp.
616, 620.

## EQUITABLE ASSIGNMENT

An assignment
which, though invalid at law, will be recognized
and enforced in equity; e. g., an assignment of a
chose in action, or of future acquisitions of the as-
signor. Lewis v. Braun, 356 Ill. 467, 191 N.E. 56,
60; Stewart v. Kane, Mo.App., 111 S.W.2d 971,
In order to work an "equitable assignment",
there must be an absolute appropriation by the
assignor of the debt or fund sought to be assigned.
Blount v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 192 Ga. 325,
15 S.E.2d 413, 415; Sneesby v. Livington, 182 Wash.
229, 46 P.2d 733, 735.

## EQUITABLE CONVERSION

A fiction which re-
sults in treating land as personalty and personalty
as land under certain circumstances. It takes
place when a contract for sale of realty becomes
binding on parties. Shay v. Penrose, 185 N.E.2d
218, 219, 25 Ill.2d 447; Panushka v. Panushka, 349
P.2d 450, 452, 221 Or. 145; Parr-Richmond Indus.
Corp. v. Boyd, 272 P.2d 16, 22, 43 C.2d 157.

## EQUITABLE DEFENSE

A defense to an action
on grounds which, prior to the passing of the Com-
mon Law Procedure Act (17 and 18 Vict. c. 125),
uity. Moz. & W. In American practice, a de-
fense which is cognizable in a court of equity, but
which is available there only, and not in an action
at law, except under the reformed codes of prac-
tice. Kelly v. Hurt, 74 Mo. 561-570; City of New
York v. Holzderber, 90 N.Y.S. 63, 44 Misc. 509.
The codes of procedure and the practice in some of
the states likewise permit both a legal and eq-
uitable defense to the same action. Susquehanna
S. S. Co. v. A. 0. Andersen & Co., 239 N.Y. 285, 146
N.E. 381, 383. It has also been construed to mean
a defense which a court of equity would recognize,
or one founded on some distinct ground of eq-
uitable jurisdiction. City of New York v. Holzder-
ber, 44 Misc. 509, 90 N.Y.S. 63, 64.
EQUITABLE DOCTRINE OF APPROXIMATION.
This doctrine differs from "Cy pres doctrine" in
purpose and application. The last mentioned doc-
trine applies where an apparent charitable inten-
tion has failed, whether by an incomplete disposi-
tion at the outset or by subsequent inadequacy of
the original object, and its purpose is to give a cy
pres or proximate application to testator's inten-
tion, whereas the "equitable doctrine of approxi-
mation" merely authorizes a court of chancery to
vary the details of administration, in order to pre-
serve the trust, and carry out the general purpose
of the donor. National Bank of Greece v. Savari-
ka, 167 Miss. 571, 148 So. 649, 654.

## EQUITABLE ELECTION

The choice to be made
by a person who may, under a will or other instru-
ment, have either one of two alternative rights or
benefits, but not both. Peters v. Bain, 133 U.S. 670,
10 S.Ct. 354, 33 L.Ed. 696.
The obligation imposed upon a party to choose
between two inconsistent or alternative rights or
claims, in cases where there is clear intention of
the person from whom he derives one that he
should not enjoy both. 2 Story, Eq.Jur. § 1075;
Dakan v. Dakan, 83 S.W.2d 620, 624, 125 Tex. 305.
A choice shown by an overt act between two
inconsistent rights, either of which may be as-
serted at the will of the chooser alone. Bierce v.
Hutchins, 205 U.S. 346, 27 S.Ct. 524, 51 L.Ed. 828;
Macbeth-Evans Glass Co. v. General Electric Co.,
C.C.A.Ohio, 246 F. 695, 701; Jenkins v. U. S., D.C.
R.I., 22 F.2d 568, 571.
EQUITABLE ESTOPPEL is that condition in
which justice forbids one to gainsay his own acts
or assertions. Goodwin Tile & Brick Co. v. De-
Vries, Iowa, 13 N.W.2d 310, 312, 155 A.L.R. 346.
The preclusion of person by his act or conduct
or silence from asserting rights which might oth-
erwise have existed. Marshall v. Wilson, Or., 154
P.2d 547, 551. The species of estoppel which equity
puts upon a person who has made a false repre-
sentation or a concealment of material facts, with
knowledge of the facts, to a party ignorant of the
truth of the matter, with the intention that the
other party should act upon it, and with the result
that such party is actually induced to act upon it,
to his damage. Bigelow, Estop. 484.
Elements or essentials of such estoppel include change
of position for the worse by party asserting estoppel, Ma-
lone v. Republic Nat. Bank & Trust Co., Tex.Civ.App., 70
S.W.2d 809, 812; Clover v. Peterson, 203 Minn. 337, 281 N.
W. 275, 278; conduct by party estopped such that it would
be contrary to equity and good conscience for him to al-
lege and prove the truth, Rody v. Doyle, 181 Md. 195, 29
A.2d 290, 293; false representation or concealment of
facts, Clark v. National Aid Life Ass'n, 177 Okl. 137, 57
P.2d 832, 833; Antrim Lumber Co. v. Wagner, 175 Okl.
564, 54 P.2d 173, 176; ignorance of party asserting estoppel
of facts and absence of opportunity to ascertain them,
Trenton Banking Co. v. Howard, N.J.Ch., 187 A. 569, 574;
Fipps v. Stidham, 174 Old. 473, 50 P.2d 680, 684; injury
from declarations, acts, or omissions of party were he
permitted to gainsay their truth, Fleishbein v. Western
Auto Supply Agency, 19 Cal.App.2d 424, 65 P.2d 928; Rob-
erts v. Friedell, 218 Minn. 88, 15 N.W.2d 496, 500; inten-
tion that representation should be acted on, Stookesberry
v. Burgher, 220 Iowa 916, 262 N.W. 820; Consolidated Cut
Stone Co. v. Seidenbach, 181 Okl. 578, 75 P.2d 442, 452;
knowledge, actual or constructive, of facts by party estop-
ped, Antrim Lumber Co. v. Wagner, 175 Okl. 364, 54 P.2d
173, 176; Lillywhite v. Coleman, 46 Ariz. 523, 52 P.2d 1157,
1160; misleading person to his prejudice, United States,
for Use and Benefit of Noland Co., v. Wood, C.C.A.Va.,
99 F.2d 80, 82; omission, misconduct or misrepresentation
misleading another, Security Savings & Trust Co. v. Port-
land Flour Mills Co., 124 Or. 276, 261 P. 432, 437; reliance
upon representation or conduct of person sought to be es-
topped, Wilkinson v. Lieberman, 327 Mo. 420, 37 S.W.2d
533, 536, George W. Armbruster, Jr., Inc., v. City of Wild-
wood, D.C.N.J., 41 F.2d 823, 829.
Estoppel in pais and equitable estoppel are convertible
terms, Brown v. Corn Exchange Nat. Bank & Trust Co.,
42 A.2d 474, 480, 136 N.J.Eq. 430; State ex rel. Squire v.
Murfey, Blossom & Co., 131 Ohio St. 289, 2 N.E.2d 866, 870.
"Legal estoppel" excludes evidence of the truth and the
equity of the particular case to support a strict rule of law
on grounds of public policy whereas "equitable estoppel"
is admitted on exactly the opposite ground of promoting
the equity and justice of the individual case by preventing
a party from asserting his rights under a general technical
rule of law, when he has so conducted himself that it
would be contrary to equity and good conscience for. him to
allege and prove the truth. First Nat. Bank v. Boles, 231
Ala. 473, 165 So. 586, 592.
.
Such estoppel may be based on acts, omission to act, rep-
resentations, admissions, concealment or silence, Carter v.
Curlew Creamery Co., 16 Wash.2d 476, 134 P.2d 66; West v.
Cleveland Ry. Co., Ohio App., 58 N.E.2d 799, 801; Ma-
honey v. Mahoney, Tex.Civ.App., 103 S.W.2d 459, 462.

## EQUITABLE EXECUTION

This term is some-
times applied to the appointment of a receiver with
power of sale. Hatch v. Van Dervoort, 54 N.J.
Eq. 511, 34 A. 938.
Though a garnishment is not an "execution," garnish-
ment after execution is practically an equitable "execu-
tion" brought for purpose of reaching nonleviable assets,
issuing on judgment in somewhat same manner as an
"execution" and in immediate aid or in lieu thereof.
First Nat. Bank v. City Guaranty Bank of Hobart, 174 Okl.
545, 51 P.2d 573, 576.
EQUITABLE LIENS are such as exist in equity.
An equitable lien arises either from a written contract
which shows an intention to charge some particular prop-
erty with a debt or obligation or is implied and declared
by a court of equity out of general considerations of right
and justice as applied to relations of the parties and cir-
cumstances of their dealings, Owensboro Banking Co. v.
Lewis, 269 Ky. 277, 106 S.W.2d 1000, 1004; Clark v. Arm-
strong & Murphy, 180 Okl. 514, 72 P.2d 362, 365, 366; It is
a mere floating and ineffective equity until such time as
judgment or decree is rendered actually subjecting prop-
erty to the payment of the debt or claim, Langford v.
Fanning, Mo., 7 S.W.2d 726, 728; Nelson v. Nelson Neal
Lumber Co., 171 Wash. 55, 17 P.2d 626, 628, 92 A.L.R. 554.
It is founded upon an agreement indicating intention that
some specific property is to be held, given, or transferred
as security, In re Friedlander's Estate, 32 N.Y.S.2d 991,
rem, Folsom v. Farmers' Bank of Vero Beach, 136 So. 524,
527, 102 Fla. 899; Clements v. Holmes, 22 Tenn.App. 230,
120 S.W.2d 988, 993; It is not an estate or property in the
thing itself or a right to recover the same. Foster v.
Thornton, 179 So. 882, 892; Jamison Coal & Coke Co. v.
Goltra, C.C.A.Mo., 143 F.2d 889, 893, 154 A.L.R. 1191; it
more properly constitutes a charge upon the thing. Eq-
uitable liens most commonly grow out of constructive
trusts. Story, Eq.Jur. § 1215; Jones v. Carpenter, 90 Fla.
407, 106 So. 127, 129, 43 A.L.R. 1409; Aldrich v. R. J.
Ederer Co., 302 Iii. 391, 134 N.E.•726, 728.
It is right by which a creditor is entitled to obtain sat-
isfaction of his debt by resort to specified property belong-
ing to debtor, Pincus v. Collins, 198 Miss. 283, 22 So.2d
361, 362; right of a special nature over property constitut-
ing a charge or incumbrance thereon. Miller v. Heisler,
Mo.App., 187 S.W.2d 485, 491; Gables Racing Assoc. v.
Persky, 148 Fla. 627, 6 So.2d 257, 262, 263; right, not rec-
ognized at law, to have a fund or specific property, or the
proceeds, applied in whole or in part to payment of a
particular debt or class of debts or obligation, Bank of
Aurora v. Aurora Co-Op. Fruit Growing & Marketing Ass'n,
Mo.App., 91 S.W.2d 177; Jamison Coal & Coke Co. v.
Goltra, C.C.A.Mo., 143 F.2d 889, 893, 154 A.L.R. 1191; Ship-
ley v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 25 Tenn.App. 452, 158 S.
W.2d 739, 741; right over subject-matter of contract, where-
by obligee is enabled to follow identical thing to which lien
attaches and enforce obligation by remedy operating di-
rectly thereon, Bassett v. City Bank & Trust Co., 116 Conn.
617, 165 A. 557; right to have property subjected in court
of equity to payment of a claim, Theatre Realty Co. v.
Aronberg-Fried Co., C.C.A.Mo., 85 F.2d 383, 388; right to
proceed in an equitable action against the subject-matter
of the lien and have it sold or sequestered and its proceeds
or rents and profits applied to the demand of the owner
of the lien, Oppenheimer v. Szulerecki, 297 Ill. 81, 130 N.E.
325, 328, 28 A.L.R. 1439.
The equitable lien differs essentially from a common-law
lien, in that in the equitable lien, possession remains with
the debtor or person who holds the proprietary interest.
Jones v. Carpenter, 90 Fla. 407, 106 So. 127, 129, 43 A.L.R.
Every express executory agreement in writing, whereby
the contracting party sufficiently indicates an intention
to make some particular property, real or personal, or fund
therein identified, a security for a debt or other obligation,
or whereby the party promises to convey, assign, or
transfer the property as security, creates an equitable lien
upon the property so indicated, which is enforceable
against the property. Knott v. Mfg. CCoo. .3,0 W.Va. 790, 5
S.E. 266; Geddes v. Reeves Coal & Dock C.C.A.Minn.,
20 F.2d 48, 50, 54 A.L.R. 282; Root Mfg. Co. v. Johnson,
C.C.A.Ind., 219 F. 397, 406.

## EQUITABLE RATE OF INTEREST

In England,
the interest, generally at a lower rate than legal,
charged against a trustee or executor improperly
or unnecessarily keeping balances or portion of
trust moneys in his hands. In re Ricker's Estate,
14 Mont. 153, 35 P. 960, 968, 29 L.R.A. 622.

## EQUITABLE RECOUPMENT

Rule of the law
which diminishes the right of a party invoking
legal process to recover a debt, to the extent that
he holds money or property of his debtor, to which
he has no moral right, and it is ordinarily a de-
fensive remedy going only to mitigation of dam-
ages. Electric Storage Battery Co. v. Rothensies,
D.C.Pa., 57 F.Supp. 731, 735.

## EQUITABLE RESCISSION

Rescission decreed
by court of equity, as distinguished from "legal
rescission" which is effected by restoration or
offer to restore. Mueller v. Michels, 184 Wis. 324,

## 199 N.W. 380, 382. ■ EQUITABLE RULE

In broad sense in which
term is sometimes used, signifies natural jus-
tice. In re New Jersey State Bar Ass'n, 111 N.J.

## EQUITAS SEQUITUR LEGEM

Equity follows
the law. Tallman v. Varick, 5 Barb. (N.Y.) 277,
282. Cas temp. Talb. 52; 1 Sto.Eq.Jur. § 64.
In respect of this maxim it has been said: "Op-
erative only within a very narrow range." 1
Pom.Eq.Jur. § 427. The reverse is quite as sound
a maxim; 9 Harv.L.Rev. 18. "The main business
of equity is avowedly to correct and supplement
the law." Phelps, Jurid.Eq. § 237. The English
Judicature Act, 1873, provides that when law and
equity conflict equity shall prevail. See Equity
Follows the Law.

## EQUITATURA

In old English law. Traveling
furniture, or riding equipments, including horses,
horse harness, etc. Reg.Orig. 100b; St.Westm. 2,
c. 39.

## EQUITY

In its broadest and most general sig-
nification, this term denotes the spirit and the hab-
it of fairness, justness, and right dealing which
would regulate the intercourse of men with men,
—the rule of doing to all others as we desire them
to do to us; or, as it is expressed by Justinian,
"to live honestly, to harm nobody, to render to
every man his due." Inst. 1, 1, 3. It is therefore
the synonym of natural right or justice. But in
this sense its obligation is ethical rather than jur-
al, and its discussion belongs to the sphere of mor-
als. It is grounded in the precepts of the con-
science, not in any sanction of positive law.
In a restricted sense, the word denotes equal
and impartial justice as between two persons
whose rights or claims are 'in conflict; justice,
that is, as ascertained by natural reason or ethic-
al insight, but independent of the formulated body
of law. This is not a technical meaning of the
term, except in so far as courts which administer
equity seek to discover it by the agencies above
mentioned, or apply it beyond the strict lines of
positive law. See Miller v. Kenniston, 86 Me. 550,
30 A. 114.
In a still more restricted sense, it is a system
of jurisprudence, or branch of remedial justice,
administered by certain tribunals, distinct from
the common-law courts and empowered to decree
"equity" in the sense last above given. Here it
becomes a complex of well-settled and well-under-
stood rules, principles, and precedents. Isabelle
Properties v. Edelman, 297 N.Y.S. 572, 574, 164
Misc. 192.
"The meaning of the word 'equity,' as used in its techni-
cal sense in English jurisprudence, comes back to this :
that it is simply a term descriptive of a certain field of
jurisdiction exercised, in the English system, by certain
courts, and of which the extent and boundaries are not
marked by lines founded upon principle so much as by the
features of the original constitution of the English scheme
of remedial law, and the accidents' of its development."
Bisp.Eq. § 11.
A system of jurisprudence collateral to, and in some re-
spects independent of, "law," properly so called; the ob-
ject of which is to render the administration of justice
more complete, by affording relief where the courts of law
are incompetent to give it, or to give it with effect, or by
exercising certain branches of jurisdiction independently of
them. This is equity in its proper modern sense; an elab-
orate system of rules and process, administered in many
cases by distinct tribunals, (termed "courts of chancery,")
is "still distinguished by Its original and animating prin-
ciple that no right should be without an adequate remedy,"
and its doctrines are founded upon the same basis of nat-
ural justice; but its action has become systematized, de-
prived of any loose and arbitrary character which might
once have belonged to it, and as carefully regulated by
fixed rules and precedents as the law itself. Burrill.
Equity, in its technical and scientific legal use, means
neither natural justice nor even all that portion of natural
justice which is susceptible of being judicially enforced. It
has a precise, limited, and definite signification, and is used
to denote a system of justice which was administered in
a particular court,-the English high court of chancery,-
which system can only be understood and explained by
studying the history of that court, and how it came to ex-
ercise what is known as its extraordinary jurisdiction.
Bisp.Eq. § 1.
That part of the law which, having power to enforce dis-
covery, (1) administers trusts, mortgages, and other fidu-
ciary obligations; (2) administers and adjusts common-law
rights where the courts of common law have no machinery;
(3) supplies a specific and preventive remedy for common-
law wrongs where courts of common law only give subse-
quent damages. Chute, Eq. 4.
Equity is a body of jurisprudence, or field of
jurisdiction, differing in its origin, theory, and
methods from the common law. Laird v. Union
Traction Co., .2 08 Pa. 574, 57 A. 987.
It is a body of rules existing by the side of the original
civil law, founded on distinct principles, and claiming in-
cidentally to supersede the civil law in virtue of a superior
sanctity inherent in those principles. Maine, Anc. Law, 27.
"As old rules become too narrow, or are felt to be out of
harmony with advancing civilization, a machinery is need-
ed for their gradual enlargement and adaption to new
views of society. One mode of accomplishing this object
on a large scale, without appearing to disregard existing
law, is the introduction, by the prerogative of some high
functionary, of a more perfect body of rules, discoverable
in his judicial conscience, which is to stand side by side
with the law of the land, overriding it in case of conflict,
as on some title of inherent superiority, but not purport-
ing to repeal it. Such a body of rules has been called
'Equity.' " Holl.Jur. 59.
"Equity," in Its technical sense, contradistinguished
from natural, and universal equity or justice, may well be
described as a "portion of justice" or natural equity, not
embodied in legislative enactments, or in the rules of com-
mon law, yet modified by a due regard thereto and to the
complex relations and conveniences of an artificial state of
society, and administered in regard to cases where the
particular rights, in respect of which relief is sought come
within some general class of rights enforced at law, or may
be enforced without detriment or inconvenience to the com-
munity; but where, as to such particular rights, the or-
dinary courts of law cannot, or originally did not, clearly
afford relief. Rob. Eq.
The remaining interest belonging to one who
has pledged or mortgaged his property, or the sur-
plus of value which may remain after the prop-
erty has been disposed of for the satisfaction of
liens. The amount or value of a property above
the total liens or charges. Des Moines Joint
Stock Land Bank of Des Moines v. Allen, 220 Iowa
448, 261 N.W. 912.
"Chancery" is synonymous and interchange-
able with "equity." Const. art. 4, § 6. Ireland
v. Cheney, 129 Ohio St. 527, 196 N.E. 267, 270.
Equitable Right
Equity also signifies an equitable right, i. a
right enforceable in a court of equity; hence, a
bill of complaint which did not show that the
plaintiff had a right entitling him to relief was
certain rights now recognized in all the courts
are still known as "equities," from having been
originally recognized only in the court of chan-
cery. Sweet.
Better Equity
The right which, in a court of equity, a second
incumbrancer has who has taken securities
against subsequent dealings to his prejudice,
which a prior incumbrancer neglected to take al-
though he had an opportunity. 1 Ch.Prec. 470,
note. See 3 Bouv.Inst. note 2462.
Countervailing Equity
A contrary and balancing equity; an equity or
right opposed to that which is sought to be en-
forced or recognized, and which ought not to be
sacrificed or subordinated to the latter, because it
is of equal strength and justice, and equally de-
serving of consideration.
Existing Equity
See Existing Equity.
Latent or Secret Equity
An equitable claim or right, the knowledge of
which has been confined to the parties for and
against whom it exists, or which has been con-
cealed from one or several persons interested in
the subject-matter.
Natural Equity
A term sometimes employed in works on juris-
prudence, possessing no very precise meaning,
but used as equivalent to justice, honesty, or mor-
ality in business relations, or man's innate sense
of right dealing and fair play. Inasmuch as equi-
ty, as now administered, is a complex system of
rules, doctrines, and precedents, and possesses,
within the range of its own fixed principles, but
little more elasticity than the law, the term "na-
tural equity" may be understood to denote, in a
general way, that which strikes the ordinary con-
science and sense of justice as being fair, right,
and equitable, in advance of the question whether
the technical jurisprudence of the chancery courts
would so regard it.
Perfect Equity
An equitable title or right which lacks nothing
to its completeness as a legal title or right except
the formal conveyance or other investiture which
would make it cognizable at law; particularly, the
equity or interest of a purchaser of real estate
who has paid the purchase rice in full and ful-
filled all conditions resting o him, but has not yet
received a deed or patent. See Shaw v. Lindsey,
60 Ala. 344; Smith v. Cockrell, 66 Ala. 75.

## EQUITY, COURTS OF

Courts which administer
justice according to the system of equity, and ac-
cording to a peculiar course of procedure or prac-
tice. Frequently termed "courts of chancery."
See 1 Bl.Comm. 92; Dowell v. Goodwin, 22 R.I.
287, 27 A. 693, 695, 51 L.R.A. 873, 84 Am.St.Rep.

## EQUITY DELIGHTS TO DO JUSTICE, AND THAT NOT BY HALVES

Tallman v. Varick, 5
Barb. (N.Y.) 277, 280; Story, Eq.P1. § 72.

## EQUITY FOLLOWS THE LAW

Talb. 52. Equity
adopts and follows the rules of law in all cases
to which those rules may, in terms, be applicable.
Equity, in dealing with cases of an equitable na-
ture, adopts and follows the analogies furnished
by the rules of law. A leading maxim of equity
jurisprudence, which, however, is not of universal
application, but liable to many exceptions. Frink
v. Commercial Bank of Emmettsburg, 195 Iowa,
1011, 191 N.W. 513.

## EQUITY JURISDICTION

In a general sense,
the jurisdiction belonging to a court of equity,
but more particularly the aggregate of those cas-
es, controversies, and occasions which form prop-
er subjects for the exercise of the powers of a
chancery court. See Wadham Oil Co. v. Tracy,
141 Wis. 150, 123 N.W. 785, 787, 18 Ann.Cas. 779;
Venner v. Great Northern R. Co., C.C.N.Y., 153 F.
408, 413, 414.
"Equity jurisdiction," in its ordinary acceptation, as dis-
tinguished on the one side from the general power to de-
cide matters at all, and on the other from the jurisdiction
"at law" or "common-law jurisdiction," is the power to
hear certain kinds and classes of civil causes according to
the principles of the method and procedure adopted by
the court of chancery, and to decide them in accordance
with the doctrines and rules of equity jurisprudence,
which decision may involve either the determination of the
equitable rights, estates, and interests of the parties to
such causes, or the granting of equitable remedies. In
order that a cause may come within the scope of the equi-
ty jurisdiction, one of two alternatives is essential; either
the primary right, estate, or interest to be maintained, or
the violation of which furnishes the cause of action, must
be equitable rather than legal; or the remedy granted
must be in its nature purely equitable, or if it be a rem-
edy which may also be given by a court of law, it must
be one which, under the facts and circumstances of the
case, can only be made complete and adequate through the
equitable modes of procedure. Norback v. Board of Di-
rectors of Church Extension Soc., 84 Utah 506, 37 P.2d 339.

## EQUITY JURISPRUDENCE

That portion of
remedial justice which is exclusively administer-
ed by courts of equity as distinguished from
courts of common law. Jackson v. Nimmo, 3
Lea (Tenn.) 609. More generally speaking, the
science which treats of the rules, principles, and
maxims which govern the decisions of a court of
equity, the cases and controversies which are con-
sidered proper subjects for its cognizance, and the
nature and form of the remedies which it grants.

## EQUITY LOOKS UPON THAT AS DONE WHICH OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN DONE

1
Story, Eq.Jur. § 64g. Equity will treat the sub-
ject-matter, as to collateral consequences and in-
cidents, in the same manner as if the final acts
contemplated by the parties had been executed
exactly as they ought to have been; not as the
parties might have executed them. Rankin v.
Rankin, 36 Ill. 293, 87 Am.Dec. 205.

## EQUITY OF A STATUTE

By this phrase is in-
tended the rule of statutory construction which
admits within the operation of a statute a class
of cases which are neither expressly named nor
excluded, but which, from their analogy to the cas-
es that are named, are clearly and justly within
the spirit and general meaning of the law; such
cases are said to be "within the equity of the
statute."

## EQUITY OF PARTNERS

A term used to desig-
nate the right of each of them to have the firm's
property applied to the payment of the firm's
debts. Colwell v. Bank, 16 R.I. 288, 17 A. 913.

## EQUITY OF REDEMPTION

The right of the
mortgagor of an estate to redeem the same after
it has been forfeited, at law, by a breach of the
condition of the mortgage, upon paying the
amount of debt, interest and costs. Riddick V.
Davis, 220 N.C. 120, 16 S.E.2d 662, 666; Broun v.
United States, C.C.A.Pa., 95 F.2d 487, 489.
The right of redemption after sale is distinct from the
equity of redemption after breach of condition and before
the sale. The former commences only when the latter
ends. One rests on the principles of equity, the other on
the terms of the statute. Hummel v. Citizens' Building &
Loan Ass'n, Ariz., 296 P. 1014, 1015.

## EQUITY SUFFERS NOT A RIGHT WITHOUT A REMEDY

cal Company v. /Etna Explosives Co., 252 F. 456,
164 C.C.A. 380.

## EQUITY TO A SETTLEMENT

right of a wife, when her husband sues in equity
for the reduction of her equitable estate to his
own possession, to have the whole or a portion of
such estate settled upon herself and her children.
Also a similar right now recognized by the equity
courts as directly to be asserted against the hus-
band. Also called the "wife's equity." Poindex-
ter v. Jeffries, Clarke v. McCleary, 12 Smedes &
M. (Miss.) 354.

EQUIVALENT, n. In patent law. Any act or
substance which is known in the arts as a proper
substitute for some other act or substance em-
ployed as an element in the invention, whose sub-
stitution for that other act or substance does not
in any manner vary the idea of means. It pos-
sesses three characteristics: It must be capable
of performing the same office in the invention as
the act or substance whose place it supplies; it
must relate to the form or embodiment alone and
not affect in any degree the idea of means; and
it must have been known to the arts at the date
of the patent as endowed with this capability.
Duff Mfg. Co. v. Forgie, 59 F. 772, 8 C.C.A. 261;
For "Fair Equivalent," see that title.
For one device to be the equivalent of another, it must
perform the same function in substantially the same way.

those which the inventor has himself employed. Superior
Skylight Co. v. August Kuhnla, D.C.N.Y., 265 F. 282, 284.

by cancellation; but this is not an accurate use.
Cloud v. Hewitt, 5 Fed.Cas. 1,085; In re Fergeson,

regular application of it, such as vitiates the pro-
ceedings and warrants the reversal of the judg-
ment.

"writ of error;" as in saying that error lies;
that a judgment may be reversed on error.
An act involving a departure from truth or ac-
curacy. Gronseth v. Mohn, 57 S.D. 604, 234 N.W.

Assignment of Errors
In practice. The statement of the plaintiff's
case on a writ of error, setting forth the errors
complained of; corresponding with the declara-
tion in an ordinary action. 2 Tidd, Pr. 1168; 3
Steph.Comm. 644. Armour v. Pennsylvania R.
Co., 353 Ill. 575, 187 N.E. 532, 534; Fahrenbrink v.
Moore, 51 Ariz. 176, 75 P.2d 360, 361. A specifica-
tion of the errors upon which the appellant will
rely, with such fullness as to give aid to the court
in the examination of the transcript. Squires v.
Foorman, 10 Cal. 298; Streeter v. State, 89 Fla.
400, 104 So. 858, 859; Largent v. Etheridge, Tex.
Civ.App., 13 S.W.2d 974, 976; Helms v. Cook, 62
183 Iowa, 1166, 168 N.W. 318, 320.
The office of an assignment of error, which is in the na-
ture of a pleading by the plaintiff in error or appellant, is
not only to inform the appellate court of the exact com-
plaint against rulings, whereby, if the complaint be sus-
tained, a judgment or decree may be changed or reversed,
hut is to inform the defendant in error or appellee
of the precise errors relied upon, in order that such de-
fendant in error or appellee may take proper steps, or
give proper directions in his own behalf, for making up a
sufficient transcript of the record to exhibit to the court
what might otherwise be insufficiently shown. Davidson
v. Bezant, 101 Fla. 1296, 132 So. 488, 489.
"Assignment of error" is formal complaint of some ac-
tion of trial court, as distinguished from "proposition,"
which merely sets forth reasons why such action is errone-
ous. Standard v. Texas Pacific Coal & Oil Co., Tex.Civ.
App., 47 S.W.2d 443, 449.
Clerical Error
See Clerical.
Common Error
(Lat. communis error, q. v.) An error for
which there are many precedents. "Common er-
ror goeth for a law." Finch, Law, b. 1, c. 3, no.
54. "Common errors" are that the declaration is
insufficient in law to maintain the action, and that
judgment was given for plaintiff instead of de-
fendant, or vice versa. Margolies v. Goldberg, 101
N.J.L. 75, 127 A. 271, 272.
Cross-Errors
Errors assigned by the respondent in a writ of
error, or appellee.
Error Apparent of Record
Plain, fundamental error that goes to the foun-
dation of the action irrespective of the evidence;
an obvious misapprehension of the applicable law.
Kenedy Mercantile Co. v. Ainsworth, Tex.Civ.App.,
281 S.W. 637; Provident Life & Accident Ins. Co.
v. Johnson, Tex.Civ.App., 235 S.W. 650, 652; Parks
v. Parks, 68 App.D.C. 363, 98 F.2d 235, 236.
Fundamental Error
In appellate practice. Error which goes to the
merits of the plaintiff's cause of action, and which
will be considered on review, whether assigned as
error or not, where the justice of the case seems to
require it. Hollywood v. Wellhausen, 28 Tex.Civ.
App. 541, 68 S.W. 329; Goodhue v. Fuller, Tex.Civ.
App., 193 S.W. 170, 172. Error in law apparent
on the face of the record. St. Louis Southwestern
Ry. Co. of Texas v. Anderson, Tex.Civ.App., 206
S.W. 696, 698.
Harmful Error
Error which more probably than improbably af-
fected the verdict or judgment prejudicially to
the party complaining. Ashby v. Virginia Ry. &
Power Co., 138 Va. 310, 122 S.E. 104, 110.
Harmless Error
In appellate practice. An error committed in
the progress of the trial below, but which was not
prejudicial to the rights of the party assigning it,
and for which, therefore, the court will not reverse
the judgment, as, where the error was neutralized
or corrected by subsequent proceedings in the
case, or where, notwithstanding the error, the par-
ticular issue was found in that party's favor, or
where, even if the error had not been committed,
he could not have been legally entitled to prevail.
Invited Error
In appellate practice. The principle of "invit-
ed error" is that if, during the progress of a cause,
a party requests or moves the court to make a rul-
ing which is actually erroneous, and the court does
so, that party cannot take advantage of the error
on appeal or review. Gresham v. Harcourt, 93
Tex. 149, 53 S.W. 1019.
Judicial Errors
Errors into which the court itself falls. State
v. District Court of Second Judicial District in and
for Silver Bow County, 55 Mont. 324, 176 P. 608,
Reversible Error
In appellate practice. Such an error as war-
rants the appellate court in reversing the judg-
ment before it; substantial error, that which rea-
sonably might have prejudiced the party com-
plaining. Shinn v. United Rys. Co. of St. Louis,
248 Mo. 173, 154 S.W. 103, 105; New Mexican R.
Co. v. Hendricks, 6 N.M. 611, 30 Pac. 901.
Technical Error

oretical error, which is practically not injurious to
the party assigning it. Epps v. State, 102 Ind. 539,
1 N.E. 491.

dered. A writ to bring before the court that pro-
nounced judgment errors in matters of fact which
had not been put in issue or passed on and were
material to validity and regularity of legal pro-
ceeding itself. Hiawassee Lumber Co. v. United
States, C.C.A.N.C., 64 F.2d 417, 418.

## ERROR CORAM VOBIS

Error in the proceed-
ings "before you;" words used in a writ of error
directed by a court of review to the court which

## ERROR FUCATUS NUDA VERITATE IN MUL- TIS

EST PROBABILIOR; ET SAZEPENUMERO
RATIONIBUS VINCIT VERITATEM ERROR.
Error artfully disguised [or colored] is, in many
instances, more probable than naked truth; and
frequently error overwhelms truth by [its show
of] reasons. 2 Coke, 73.

## ERROR IN EXERCISE OF JURISDICTION

Er-
ror in determination of questions of law or fact
depends. Burgess v. Nail, C.C.A.Okl., 103 F.2d
37, 43.

## ERROR IN FACT

In judicial proceedings, error
in fact occurs when, by reason of some fact which
is unknown to the court and not apparent on the
record (e. g., the coverture, infancy, or death of
one of the parties), it renders a judgment which
is void or voidable. Cruger v. McCracken, 87
Tex. 584, 30 S.W. 537; Kihlholz v. Wolff, 8 Ill.
App. 371.

## ERROR IN LAW

An error of the court in ap-
plying the law to the case on trial, e. g., in ruling
on the admission of evidence, or in charging the
jury. McKenzie v. Bismarck Water Co., 6 N.D.
361, 71 N.W. 608; Scherrer v. Hale, 9 Mont. 63, 22
Pac. 151.

## ERROR IN VACUO

Error in adverse ruling
without adverse effect is "error in vacuo" which
may subject the erring judge to criticism but not
the case to re-trial. United States v. A Certain
Tract or Parcel of Land in Chatham County, Ga.,
D.C.Ga., 47 F.Supp. 30, 36.

## ERROR JURIS NOCET

Error of law injures. A
mistake of the law has an injurious effect; that
is, the party committing it must suffer the con-
sequences. Mackeld.Rom.Law, § 178; 1 Story, Eq.
Jur. § 139, note.

## ERROR NOMINIS

Error of name. A mistake
of detail in the name of a person; used in contra.
distinction to error de persona, a mistake as *to
identity.

## ERROR NOMINIS NUNQUAM NOCET, SI DE IDENTITATE REI CONSTAT

A mistake in the
name of a thing is never prejudicial, if it be clear
as to the identity of the thing itself, [where the
thing intended is certainly known.] 1 Duer, Ins.
171. This maxim is applicable only where the
means of correcting th€ mistake are apparent on
the face of the instrument to be construed. Id.

## ERROR OF FACT

That is called "error of fact"
which proceeds either from ignorance of that
which really exists or from a mistaken belief in
the existence of that which has none. See Norton
v. Marden, 15 Me. 45, 32 Am.Dec. 132. Finding of
fact contrary to the weight of the evidence is an
error of fact. Wear v. Imperial Window Glass
Co., C.C.A.Mo., 224 F. 60, 62. Cf. Error in Fact,
supra.
ERROR `OF LAW. He is under an error of law
who is truly informed of the existence of facts,
but who draws from them erroneous conclusions

A clause usually found
in leases or contracts executed subject to price
control regulations. Under this clause, in the case
of a lease, the landlord is authorized to collect the
maximum rent permissible under rent regulations
in force at time of execution of the lease. The es-
calator part of the clause of the lease consists in
the provision that in the event that the rent regu-
lations are modified during the term of the lease,
the tenant will pay the increased rental following
the allowance thereof. Wasservogel v. Meyero-
witz, 191 Misc. 594, 79 N.Y.S.2d 256; and 89 N.Y.S.
2d 290, 275 App.Div. 387. In the case of a sales
contract, the escalator clause usually provides in
effect that should the maximum prices promul-
gated be increased or decreased during the life of
the contract, payment will be made by the pur-
chaser at a rate of increase or decrease not to ex-
ceed the same ratio that the prices quoted bear
to the maximum prices authorized. Simpson
Bros. v. District of Columbia, D.C.D.C., 73 F.Supp.
858, and 179 F.2d 430. Pfotzer et al. v. United
States, 176 F.2d 675; Record & Tribune Co. v.
Brandtjen & Kluge, Inc., Iowa, 39 N.W.2d 288.

former is the case when the keeper voluntarily
concedes to the prisoner any liberty not author-
ized by law. The latter is the case when the pris-
oner contrives to leave his prison by forcing his
way out, or any other means, without the knowl-
edge or against the will of the keeper, but through
the latter's carelessness or the insecurity of the
building. Cortis v. Dailey, 21 App.Div. 1, 47 N.Y.
S. 454; U. S. v. Hoffman, D.C.I11., 13 F.2d 269, 270;

827. An example is the unauthorized production
of a prisoner in court by his custodian. In re
Rigg, 123 A. 243, 95 N.J.Eq. 341.

## ESCAPE FROM PRISON

A prisoner serving a
sentence of imprisonment in a state prison is, in
contemplation of law, a prisoner therein, as well
when at work outside under the surveillance of
prison guards as when confined within its walls,
so that if he escapes when outside he escapes from
a prison within Pen.Code, §§ 106, 787. People v.
Vanderburg, 67 Cal.App. 217, 227 P. 621.

## ESCAPE WARRANT

In English practice. This
was a warrant granted to retake a prisoner com-
mitted to the custody of the king's prison who
had escaped therefrom. It was obtained on affi-
davit from the judge of the court in which the
action had been brought, and was directed to all
the sheriffs throughout England, commanding
them to retake the prisoner and commit him to
gaol when and where taken, there to remain until
the debt was satisfied. Jacob; Brown.

side to the outside of the mine. Roberts v. Ten-
nessee Coal, Iron & R. Co., C.C.A.Ala., 255 F. 469,

ESCHOIR, QUOD EST ACCIDERE, QUIA AC-
CIDIT DOMINO EX EVENTU ET EX INSPERA-
TO. Co.Litt. 93. Escheat is derived from the
French word "eschoir," which signifies to happen,
because it falls to the lord from an event and from
an unforeseen circumstance.
ESCHIETIE VULGO DICUNTUR QUIE DECID-
ENTIBUS IIS QUIE DE REGE TENENT, CUM
NON EXISTIT RATIONE SANGUINIS HIERES,
AD FISCUM RELABUNTUR. Those things are
commonly called "escheats" which revert to the
exchequer from a failure of issue in those who
hold of the king, when there does not exist any
heir by consanguinity.

## ESCHEAT

In feudal law. Escheat Is an ob-
struction of the course of descent, and consequent
determination of the tenure, by some unforeseen
contingency, in which case the land naturally re-
sults back, by a kind of reversion, to the original
grantor, or lord of the fee. 2 B1.Comm. 15; Wal-
lace v. Harmstad, 44 Pa. 501; Marshall v. Love-
lass, 1 N.C. 445; Kavanaugh v. Cohoes Power &
Light Corporation, 114 Misc. 590, 187 N.Y.S. 216,
231; State v. Phoenix Say. Bank & Trust Co., 60
Ariz. 138, 132 P.2d 637, 638.
It is the casual descent, in the nature of forfei-
ture, of lands and tenements within his manor, to
a lord, either on failure of issue of the tenant dy-
ing seised or on account of the felony of such ten-
ant. Jacob.
Also the land or fee itself, which thus fell back
to the lord. Such lands were called "excadentice,"
or "terrce excadentiales." Fleta, lib. 6, c. 1; Co.
Litt. 13a.
In American law. Escheat signifies a reversion
of property to the state in consequence of a want
of any individual competent to inherit. The state
is deemed to occupy the place and hold the rights
of the feudal lord. See 4 Kent, Comm. 423, 424.
Center v. Kramer, 112 Ohio St. 269, 147 N.E. 602,
604; In re O'Connor's Estate, 126 Neb. 182, 252
N.W. 826; Braun v. McPherson, 277 Mich. 396, 269
N.W. 211, 212.
"Escheat at feudal law was the right of the lord of a fee
to re-enter upon the same when it became vacant by the
extinction of the blood of the tenant. This extinction
might either be per clef ectum sanguinis or else per delicturn
tenentis, where the course of descent was broken by the
corruption of the blood of the tenant. As a fee might be
holden either of the crown or from some inferior lord, the
escheat was not always to the crown. The word 'escheat,'
in this country, at the present time, merely indicates the
preferable right of the state to an estate left vacant, and
without there being any one in existence able to make
claim thereto." 29 Am. Dec. 232, note.
Single Escheat
When all a person's movables fall to the crown,
as a casualty, because of his being declared rebel.
Wharton.

In English law. The name of an
officer who was appointed in every county to look

elicited during such interrogation may be used in
a criminal trial. Escobedo v. State of Illinois, 378

tionally held by a third person, or the possession

delivered "in escrow." This use of the term, how-
ever, is a perversion of its meaning.

ESSOIN, n. In old English law. An excuse for
not appearing in court at the return of the proc-
ess. Presentation of such excuse. Spelman; 1

common expression in Littleton, especially at the
commencement of a section; and, according to
Lord Coke, "it ever teacheth us some rule of law,
or general or sure leading point." Co.Litt. 16.
EST AUTEM JUS PUBLICUM ET PRIVATUM,
QUOD EX NATURALIBUS PRJECEPTIS AUT
GENTIUM, AUT CIVILIBUS EST COLLECTUM;
ET QUOD IN JURE SCRIPT() JUS APPELLA-
TUR, ID IN LEGE ANGLLZE RECTUM ESSE
DICITUR. Public and private law is that which
is collected from natural precepts, on the one hand

## ESTABLISH

This word occurs frequently in the
constitution of the United States, and it is there
used in different meanings: (1) To settle firmly,
to fix unalterably; as to establish justice, which is
the avowed object of the constitution. (2) To
make or form; as to establish a uniform rule of
naturalization, and uniform laws on the subject of
bankruptcies, which evidently does not mean that
these laws shall be unalterably established as jus-
tice. (3) To found, to create, to regulate; as: •
"Congress shall have power to establish post-roads
and post-offices." (4) To found, recognize, con-
firm, or admit; as: "Congress shall make no law
respecting an establishment of religion." (5)
To create, to ratify, or confirm; as: "We, the peo-
ple," etc., "do ordain and establish this constitu-
tion." 1 Story, Const. § 454. And see Ware v. U.
S., 4 Wall. 632, 18 L.Ed. 389; U. S. v. Smith, 4 N.J.
L. 33.
To settle or fix firmly; place on a permanent
footing; found; create; put beyond doubt or dis-

nance or statute. Especially used of those ordi-
nances or statutes passed in the reign of Edw. I.

## ESTADAL

In Spanish law. In Spanish America,
a measure of land of sixteen square varas, or
yards. 2 White, Recop. 139.
ESTADIA (or Sobrestadia). In Spanish law. De-
lay in a voyage, or in the delivery of cargo, caused
by the charterer or consignee, for which demur-
rage is payable. The time for which the party who
has chartered a vessel, or is bound to receive the
cargo, has to pay demurrage on account of his de-
ESTANDARD. L. Fr. A standard (of weights
and measures.) So called because it stands con-
stant and immovable, and hath all other measures
coming towards it for their conformity. Termes
de la Ley.

## ESTANQUES

Wears (weirs) or kiddies in rivers.

## ESTATE

The interest which any one has in
lands, or in any other subject of property. 1
Prest.Est. 20. And see Mulford v. Le Franc, 26
Cal. 103; Robertson v. VanCleave, 129 Ind. 217, 29
N.E. 781, 15 L.R.A. 68; Ball v. Chadwick, 46 Ill.
31. An estate in lands, tenements, and heredita-
ments signifies such interest as the tenant has
therein. 2 Bl.Comm. 103. The condition or cir-
cumstance in which the owner stands with regard
to his property. 2 Crabb, Real Prop. p. 2, § 942;
Boyd v. Sibold, 7 Wash.2d 279, 109 P.2d 535,
539. In this sense, "estate" is constantly used in
conveyances in connection with the words "right,"
"title," and "interest," and is, in a great degree,
synonymous with all of them. See Co.Litt. 345.
The degree, quantity, nature, and extent of interest
which a person has in real property is usually referred to
as an estate, and it varies from absolute ownership down
to naked possession. Nicholson Corporation v. Ferguson,
114 Okl. 10, 243 P. 195, 200; Washington Ins. Co. v. Pass,
for Use of Nalley, 64 Ga.App. 221, 12 S.E.2d 460, 461;
Gibbs v. Lester, Tex.Com.App., 41 S.W.2d 28, 29, 80 A.L.R.
In another sense, "estate" designates the prop-
erty (real or personal) in which one has a right
or interest; the subject-matter of ownership; the
corpus of property. Thus, we speak of a "valu-
able estate," "all my estate," "separate estate,"
"trust estate," etc. This, also, is its meaning in
the classification of property into "real estate" and
"personal estate." Conriertin v. Concannon, 122
Or. 387, 259 P. 290, 292; Bates v. Sparrell, 10 Mass.
323; Archer v. Deneale, 1 Pet. 585, 7 L.Ed. 272;
Den v. Snitcher, 14 N.J.L. 53.
There is no such legal entity as an "estate." Hansen v.
Stanton, 177 Wash. 257, 31 P.2d 903, 904, 92 A.L.R. 1037.
It is a convenient phrase, to identify the subject of litiga-
tion in the orphans' court, and in proceedings in rem it
may be treated as harmless superfluity, but as a designa-
tion of a party to be served with a writ it is unknown to
the law. It cannot be made the plaintiff in an action, as it
is not a person and cannot sue or be sued. In re Harris-
burg Trust Co., 80 Pa.Super.Ct. 585.
The word "estate" is a word of the greatest extension,
and comprehends every species of property, real and per-
sonal. It describes both the corpus and the extent of in-
terest. Deering v. Tucker, 55 Me. 284; Frazer v. First
Nat. Bank of Mobile, 235 Ala. 252, 178 So. 441, 444. When
used in some connections, it signifies everything of which
riches or fortune may consist. Williams v. Chicago, B. &
Q. R. Co., 155 S.W. 64, 66, 169 Mo.App. 468.
"Estate" comprehends everything a man owns, real and
personal, and ought riot to be limited in its construction,
unless connected with some other word which must neces-
sarily have that effect. Weber v. Bardon, 92 N.J.Eq. 190,
111 A. 649, 650; Black v. Sylvania Producing Co., 105 Ohio
St. 346, 137 N.E. 904, 905.
It means, ordinarily, the whole of the property owned by
anyone, the realty as well as the personalty. Hunter v.
Husted, 45 N.C. 141; Wingard v. Harrison, 337 Ill. 387, 169
N.E. 232, 233; Miller v. Miller, 200 Iowa, 1070, 205 N.W.
870, 874, 43 A.L.R. 567; In re Quackenbush's Will, 127
Misc. 731, 217 N.Y.S. 493, 496; Jennings v. Jennings, 299
A man's "estate" is that which he can sell or dispose of
at his pleasure or what he can pass on to another. Howard
v. Mitchell, 268 Ky. 429, 105 S.W.2d 128, 133.
Estates may be either absolute or conditional.
An absolute estate is a full and complete estate,
Cooper v. Cooper, 56 N.J.Eq. 48, 38 A. 198, or an es-
tate in lands not subject to be defeated upon any
condition. In this phrase the word "absolute" is
not used legally to distinguish a fee from a life-
estate, but a qualified or conditional fee from a fee
simple. Greenawalt v. Greenawalt, 71 Pa. 483. A
conditional estate is one, the existence of which
depends upon the happening or not happening of
some uncertain event, whereby the estate may be
either originally created, or enlarged, or finally
defeated. 2 Bl.Comm. 151. Estates are also
classed as executed or executory. The former is
an estate whereby a present interest passes to and
resides in the tenant, not dependent upon any
subsequent circumstance or contingency. • They
are more commonly called "estates in possession."
2 Bl.Comm. 162. An estate where there is vested
in the grantee a present and immediate right of
present or future enjoyment. An executory estate
is an estate or interest in lands, the vesting or en-
joyment of which depends upon some future con-
tingency. Such estate may be an executory de-
vise, or an executory remainder, which is the same
as a contingent remainder, because no present in-
terest passes. Further, estates may be legal or
equitable. The former is that kind of estate which
is properly cognizable in the courts of common
law, though noticed, also, in the courts of equity.
1 Steph.Comm. 217. And see Sayre v. Mohney, 30
Or. 238, 47 P. 197; In re Qualifications of Electors,
19 R.I. 387, 35 A. 213. An equitable estate is an
estate an interest in which can only be enforced
in a court of chancery. Avery v. Dufrees, 9 Ohio
145. That is properly an equitable estate or in-
terest for which a court of equity affords the only
remedy; and of this nature, especially, is the
benefit of every trust, express or implied, which
is not converted into a legal estate by the statute
of uses. The rest are equities of redemption, con-
structive trusts, and all equitable charges. Burt.
Comp. c. 8. Brown v. Freed, 43 Ind. 253; In re
Qualifications of Electors, 19 R.I. 387, 35 A. 213.
"Equitable estates" are in equity what legal es-
tates are in law; the ownership of the equitable
estate is regarded by equity as the real ownership,
and the legal estate is, as has been said, no more
than the shadow always following the "equitable
estate," which is the substance. Town of Cascade
v. Cascade County, 75 Mont. 304, 243 P. 806, 808.
A contingent estate is one which depends for
its effect upon an event which may or may not
happen, as, where an estate is limited to a person
not yet born. Conventional estates are those free-
holds not of inheritance or estates for life, which
are created by the express acts of the parties, in
contradistinction to those which are legal and
arise from the operation of law. A dominant es-
tate, in the law of easements, is the estate for
the benefit of which the easement exists, or the
tenement whose owner, as such, enjoys an ease-
ment over an adjoining estate. An expectant es-
tate is one which is not yet in possession, but the
enjoyment of which is to begin at a future time;
a present or vested contingent right of future en-
joyment. Examples are remainders and rever-
sions. A future estate is an estate which is not
now vested in the grantee, but is to commence in
possession at some future time. It includes re-
mainders, reversions, and estates limited to com-
mence in futuro without a particular estate to sup-
port them, which last are not good at common law,
except in the case of chattel interests. See 2 Bl.
Comm. 165. An estate limited to commence in pos-
session at a future day, either without the inter-
vention of a precedent estate, or on the determina-
tion by lapse of time, or otherwise, of a precedent
estate created at the same time. Griffin v. Shep-
ard, 124 N.Y. 70, 26 N.E. 339; Sabledowsky v. Ar-
buckle, 50 Minn. 475, 52 N.W. 920; A particular
estate is a limited estate which is taken out of the
fee, and which precedes a • remainder; as an es-
tate for years to A., remainder to B. for life; or
an estate for life to A., remainder to B. in tail.
This precedent estate is called the "particular es-
tate," and the tenant of such estate is called the
"particular tenant." 2 Bl.Comm. 165; Bunting v.
Speek, 41 Kan. 424, 21 P. 288, 3 L.R.A. 690. A
servient estate, in the law of easements, is the
estate upon which the easement is imposed or
against which it is enjoyed; an estate subjected
to a burden or servitude for the benefit of another
estate. Walker v. Clifford, 128 Ala. 67, 29 So.
588, 86 Am.St.Rep. 74; Dillman v. Hoffman, 38
Wis. 572. A settled estate, in English law, is one
created or limited under a settlement; that is, one
in which the powers of alienation, devising, and
transmission according to the ordinary rules of
descent are restrained by the limitations of the
settlement. Micklethwait v. Micklethwait, 4 C.B.,
N.S., 858. A vested estate is one in which there
is an immediate right of present enjoyment or a
present fixed right of future enjoyment; an es-
tate as to which there is a person in being who
would have an immediate right to the possession
upon the ceasing of some intermediate or prece-
dent estate. Flanner v. Fellows, 206 Ill. 136, 68
N.E. 1057.
Original and derivative estates. An original is
the first of several estates, bearing to each other
the relation of a particular estate and a reversion.
An original estate is contrasted with a derivative
estate; and a derivative estate is a particular in-
terest carved out of another estate of larger ex-
tent. Prest.Est. 125.
For the names and definitions of the various
kinds of estates in land, see the different titles
below.
"Estate" and "heirs" are not equivalent terms,
Martin v. Hale, 167 Tenn. 438, 71 S.W.2d 211, 214;
Abraham v. Abraham, 245 App.Div. 302, 280 N.Y.S.
"Estate" and "property" may be used synony-
mously, McVicar v. McVicar, 128 Kan. 394, 278
P. 36, 38; Ponsonby v. Sacramento Suburban
Fruit Lands Co., 210 Cal. 229, 291 P. 167, 168.
Fast Estate
Real property. A term sometimes used in wills.
Lewis v. Smith, 9 N.Y. 502, 61 Am.Dec. 706.
Landed Estate or Property
See Landed Estate or Property.
Qualified Estate
Interests in real property which are not absolute
and unconditional including fee tail, estates on
condition, estates on limitation, and estates on con-
ditional limitation. Carpender v. City of New
Brunswick, 135 N.J.Eq. 397, 39 A.2d 40, 43.
Real Estate
Landed property, including all estates and inter-
ests in lands which are held for life or for some
greater estate, and whether such lands be of free-
hold or copyhold tenure. Wharton.
As to "Homestead," "Movable," "Residuary,"
"Separate," and "Trust" estate, see those titles.
Financial or Personal Status
In a wider sense, a man's whole financial status
or condition,—the aggregate of his interests and
concerns, so far as regards his situation with ref-
erence to wealth or its objects, including debts
and obligations, as well as possessions and rights.
Thus, we speak of "debts due the estate," or say
that "A.'s estate is a stockholder in the bank."
In this sense it is a fictitious or juridical person,
the idea being that a man's business status con-
tinues his existence, for its special purposes, un-
til its final settlement and dissolution. See Mor-
gannelli's Estate v. City of Derby, 105 Conn. 545,
135 A. 911; In re Watson, 86 Misc. 588, 148 N.Y.S.
902, 908.
In its broadest sense, the social, civic, or po-
litical condition or standing of a person; or a
class of persons considered as grouped for social,
civic, or political purposes; as in the phrases, "the
third estate," "the estates of the realm." See 1
B1.Comm. 153.
"Estate" and "degree," when used in the sense
of an individual's personal status, are synonymous,
and indicate the individual's rank in life. State
v. Bishop, 15 Me. 122.

## ESTATE AD REMANENTIAM

An estate in fee-
simple. Glan. 1. 7, c. 1.

## ESTATE AT SUFFERANCE

The interest of a
tenant who has come rightfully into possession of
lands by permission of the owner, and continues
to occupy the same after the period for which he
is entitled to hold by such permission. 1 Washb.
Real Prop. 392; 2 Bl.Comm. 150; Co.Litt. 57b.
The estate arises where one comes into possession
of land by lawful title, but keeps it afterwards
without any title at all, and the original entry
need not have been under lease or as a tenant of
the dispossessing landlord. Malone v. Floyd, 50
ESTATE AT WILL. A species of estate less-than
freehold, where lands and tenements are let by
one man to another, to have and to hold at the
will of the lessor; and the tenant by force of this
lease obtains possession. 2 Bl.Comm. 145; 4 Kent,
Comm. 110; Litt. § 68; Co.Litt. 55a; Tud.L.Cas.R.
P. 10, 14. Or it is where lands are let without lim-
iting any certain and determinate estate. 2 Crabb,
Real Prop. p. 403, § 1543.
The estate arises where lands or tenements are express-
ly demised by one person to another to be held during the
joint wills of both parties, or it may arise by implication of
law wherever one person is put in possession of another's
land with the owner's consent, but under an agreement
which does not suffice to create in the tenant an estate
of freehold or for years. Eason v. Rose, 183 Va. 359, 32 S.
E.2d 66, 68.

## ESTATE BY ELEGIT

See Elegit.

## ESTATE BY ENTIRETY

A form of co-ownership
of realty or personalty held by husband and wife
in which there is unity of estate, unity of posses-
sion and unity of control of entire property, and
on death of one, survivor takes estate under orig-
inal conveyance. In re Cochran's Real Estate, Sel.
Orph., 66 A.2d 497, 499; In re Gallagher's Estate,
352 Pa. 476, 43 A.2d 132, 133.

## ESTATE BY PURCHASE

One acquired in any
other method than descent. In re Field, 182 App.
Div. 226, 169 N.Y.S. 677, 679. See, also, Purchase.

## ESTATE BY STATUTE MERCHANT

An estate
whereby the creditor, under the custom of London,
retained the possession of all his debtor's lands
until his debts were paid. 1 Greenl. Cruise, Dig.
515. See Statute Merchant.

## ESTATE BY STATUTE STAPLE

See Staple.

## ESTATE BY THE CURTESY

See Curtesy.

## ESTATE BY THE ENTIRETY

Called also estate
in entirety, or estate by the entireties. An estate
in joint tenancy, plus the unity of the marital re-
lation. Hoyt v. Winstanley, 221 Mich. 515, 191
N.W. 213, 214. A common-law estate, based on
the doctrine that husband and wife are one, and
that a conveyance of real property to husband and
wife creates but one estate. Klorfine v. Cole, 121
Or. 76, 252 P. 708, 709. An estate held by husband
and wife together so long as both live, and, after
the death of either, by the survivor. It is an es-
tate held by husband and wife by virtue of a title
acquired by them jointly after marriage. Bailey
v. Smith, 89 Fla. 303, 103 So. 833, 834. A creature
of the common law created by legal fiction based
wholly on the common-law doctrine that husband
and wife are one, and hence a conveyance to hus-
band and wife created only one estate, and each
was owner of the whole estate, and neither could
dispose of it without the consent of the other, and
on thè death of one survivor was the owner in
fee simple. Wimbush v. Danford, 292 Mo. 588,
238 S.W. 460, 466; In re Flynn, D.C.Pa., 1 F.2d
566, 567; Alexander v. Alexander, 154 Or. 317, 58
P.2d 1265, 1270, 1271.
An "estate by entireties" resembles a "joint tenancy" in
that there is a right of survivorship in both, but such an
latter may be invested in any number of natural persons
each of whom Is seized of an undivided moiety of the
whole, whereas a "tenancy by entirety" is vested in two
persons only, who in law are regarded as only one, and
each of whom becomes seized of the estate as a whole.
Heffner v. White, 113 Ind.App. 296, 45 N.E.2d 342, 346;
Carlisle v. Parker, 8 W.W.Harr. 83;188 A. 67.

## ESTATE DUTY

A duty imposed in England (act
of 1894) superseding probate duty, taxing not the
interest to which some person succeeds on a death,
but the interest which ceased by reason of the
death. Hansen, Death Duties 63. It is leviable on
property which was left untouched by probate du-
ty, such as real estate, yet it is in substance of
the same nature as the old probate duty.

## ESTATE FOR LIFE

See Life Estate.

## ESTATE FOR YEARS

A species of estate less
than freehold, where a man has an interest in
lands and tenements, and a possession thereof, by
virtue of such interest, for some fixed and deter-
minate period of time; as in the case where lands
are let for the term of a certain number of years,
,
agreed upon between the lessor and the lessee, and
the lessee enters thereon. 1 Steph.Comm. 263, 264.
Blackstone calls this estate a "contract" for the
possession of lands or tenements for some deter-
minate period. 2 Bl.Comm. 140. See Hutcheson
v. Hodnett, 115 Ga. 990, 42 S.E. 422; Harbottle v.
Central Coal & Coke Co., 134 Ark. 254, 203 S.W.
1044, 1046; 2 Crabb, R.P. § 1267; Bac.Abr. Leases;
Wms.R.P. 195. Such estates are frequently called
terms.
"Estates for years" embrace all terms limited to endure
for a definite and ascertained period, however short or
long the period may be; they embrace terms for a fixed
number of weeks or months or for a single year, as well as
for any definite number of years, however great. Guy v.
Brennan, 60 Cal.App. 452, 213 P. 265, 267. Compare Met-
calf Auto Co. v. Norton, 119 Me. 103, 109 A. 384.

## ESTATE FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD

An es-
tate continuing for successive periods of a year,
or successive periods of a fraction of a year, un-
less it is terminated. Pitney-Bowes Postage Meter
Co. v. United States, D.C.Conn., 57 F.Supp. 365, 366.

## ESTATE FROM YEAR TO YEAR

An example of
an estate for years. It is of later origin and is not
found in Littleton (see § 381). It exists in cases
where the parties stipulate for it, and also where
the parties by their conduct have placed them-
selves in the relation of landlord and tenant with-
out adopting any other term. If a tenar4 has
been allowed to hold over after the expiratibn of
his term in such a way as to preclude the possibil-
ity of his becoming a tenant on sufferance, it is
a tenancy from year to year. Jenks, Mod.Land
Law 88. See, also, Odger, C.L. 869; 7 Q.B. 958.
It was originally a development of a tenancy at
will, by which the tenancy was terminable only
at the time of the year at which it began, and on
notice.

## ESTATE IN COMMON

An estate in lands held
by two or more persons, with interests accruing
under different titles; or accruing under the same
title, but at different periods; or conferred by
words of limitation importing that the grantees
See Tenancy in qommon. An estate held in joint
possession by two or more persons at the same
time by several and distinct titles. 1 Washb.R.P.
415; 2 Bla.Comm. 191; 1 Pres.Est. 139.

## ESTATE IN COPARCENARY

See Coparcenary.

## ESTATE IN DOWER

See Dower.

## ESTATE IN EXPECTANCY

One which is not
yet in possession, but the enjoyment of which is
to begin at a future time; an estate giving a pres-
ent or vested contingent right of future enjoy-
ment. One in which the right to pernancy of the
profits is postponed to some future period. Such
are estates in remainder and reversion. Underhill
v. R. Co., 20 Barb. 455; Fenton v. Miller, 108 1Vrich.
246, 65 N.W. 966; Ayers v. Trust Co., 187 Ill. 42,
58 N.E. 318.

See Tail, Estate in.

## ESTATE IN JOINT TENANCY

See Tenancy.

## ESTATE IN LANDS

Property one has in lands,
tenements or hereditaments, or conditions or. cir-
cumstances in which tenant stands as to his prop-
erty. Tallman v. Eastern Illinois & Peoria R. Co.,
379 Ill. 441, 41 N.E.2d 537, 540.

## ESTATE IN REMAINDER

See Remainder.

## ESTATE IN REVERSION

See Reversion.

## ESTATE IN SEVERALTY

An estate held by a
person in his own right only, without any other
person being joined or connected with him in point
of interest, during. his estate. This is the most
common and usual way of holding an estate. 2 Bl.
Comm. 179; Cruise, Dig. tit. 18, c. 1, § 1.

## ESTATE IN VADIO

An estate in gage or pledge.
2 Bl.Comm. 157; 1 Steph.Comm. 282. See Mort-
gage.

## ESTATE LESS THAN FREEHOLD

An estate
for years, estate at will, or estate at sufferance.
Fowler v. Marion & Pittsburg Coal Co., 315 Ill. 312,
146 N.E. 318, 319. See Estate of Freehold.

## ESTATE OF FREEHOLD

See Freehold.

## ESTATE OF INHERITANCE

An estate which
may descend to heirs. 1 Washb.R.P. 51; Adminis-
tration & Trust Co. v. Catron, 171 Tenn. 268, 102
S.W.2d 59, 60. A species of freehold estate in
lands, otherwise called a "fee," where the tenant
is not only entitled to enjoy the land for his own
life, but where, after his death, it is cast by the
law upon the persons who successively represent
him in perpetuum, in right of blood, according to
a certain established order of descent. 1 Steph.
Comfn. 218; Litt. § 1; Nellis v. Munson, 108 N.Y.
453, 15 N.E. 739; Roulston v. Hall, 66 Ark. 305,
50 S.W. 690, 74 Am.St.Rep. 97; George v. George,
51 Ohio App. 169, 200 N.E. 142, 143.
Estates of freehold are divided into those of inheritance
and those not of inheritance. All estates of inheritance in
tenements are freehold; but, since freeholds embrace es-
endure for life, all freeholds are not "estates of inherit-
ance." Beirl v. Columbia County, 73 Or. 107, 144 P. 457,
460; Crabb, R.P. § 945.
ESTATE ON CONDITIONAL LIMITATION.
An estate conveyed to one person so that, upon oc-
currence or failure of occurrence of some contin-
gent event, whether conditional or limitative, the
estate shall depart from original grantee and pass
to another. Carpender v. City of New Brunswick,
135 N.J.Eq. 397, 39 A.2d 40, 43.

## ESTATE ON LIMITATION

An estate originated
by the use of words denoting duration of time,
such as while, during, so long as, and the like and
when designated limitative event happens, such
estate ends naturally without any re-entry and
property reverts to grantor. Carpender v. City
of New Brunswick, 135 N.J.Eq. 397, 39 A.2d 40,
43. Sometimes referred to as "base fee", "quali-
fied fee", "determinable fee", or "fee simple de-
feasible". Lehigh Valley R. Co. v. Chapman, 171
A.2d 653, 657, 35 N.J. 177.

## ESTATE PUR AUTRE VIE

See Pur Autre Vie.

## ESTATE SUBJECT TO A CONDITIONAL LIMI- TATION

The .distinction between an estate upon
condition subsequent and an "estate subject to a
conditional limitation" is that in former words
creating condition do not originally limit term, but
merely permit its termination upon happening of
contingency, while in latter words creating it limit
continuation of estate to time preceding happening
of contingency. Johnson v. Lane, 199 Ark. 740,
135 S.W.2d 853, 866.

## ESTATE TAIL

See Tail, Estate in.

## ESTATE TAIL, QUASI

When a tenant for life
grants his estate to a man and his heirs, as these
words, though apt and proper to create an estate
tail, cannot do so, because the grantor, being only
tenant for life, cannot grant in perpetuum, there-
fore they are said to create an estate tail quasi,
or improper. Brown.

## ESTA'T'E TAX

An excise tax upon privilege of
transferring or transmitting property by reason of
death and is not tax on property itself. Friend
v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, C.C.A.7, 119
F.2d 959, 960; In re Vanderbilt's Estate, 281 N.Y.
297, 22 N.E.2d 379, 390. An "estate tax" taxes,
not the interest to which some person succeeds on
a death, but the interest which ceases by reason of
the death; while the "inheritance tax" is based
on the interest to which the living person succeeds.
In re Ogden's Estate, 209 Wis. 162, 244 N.W. 571,
It is an "estate tax" when the tax is required to be paid
on the entire net estate before it is divided into its several
parts to be distributed. State Tax Commission v. Back-
man, 88 Utah 424, 55 P.2d 171, 174.

## ESTATE UPON CONDITION

An estate in lands,
the existence of which depends upon the happen-
ing or not happening of some uncertain event,
whereby the estate may be either originally creat-
ed, or enlarged, or finally defeated. 2 Bl.Comm.
tate having a qualification annexed to it, by which
it may, upon the happening of a particular event,
be created, or enlarged, or destroyed. 4, Kent,
Comm. 121. Uri' red States v. 1,010.8 Acres, More
or Less, Situate in Sussex County, Del., D.C.Del.,
56 F.Supp. 120, 127.

## ESTATE UPON CONDITION EXPRESSED

An
estate granted, either in fee-simple or otherwise,
with an express qualification annexed, whereby
the estate granted shall either commence, be en-
larged, or be defeated upon performance or breach
of such qualification or condition. 2 Bl.Comm.
154. An estate which is so expressly defined and
limited by the words of its creation that it cannot
endure for any longer time than till the contin-
gency happens upon which the estate is to fail. 1
Steph.Comm. 278.

## ESTATE UPON CONDITION IMPLIED

An es-
tate having a condition annexed to it inseparably
from its essence and constitution, although no
condition be expressed in words. 2 Bl.Comm. 152;
4 Kent, Comm. 121.

## ESTATES OF THE REALM

The lords spiritual,
the lords temporal, and the commons of Great
Britain. 1 Bl.Comm. 153. Sometimes called the
"three estates." Inasmuch as the lords spiritual
have no separate assembly or negative hi their
political capacity, some authorities reduce the es-
tates in Great Britain to two, the lords and com-
mons. Webster, Dict.
Generally in feudal Europe there were three estates, the
clergy, nobles, and commons. In England (until about the
14th century) the three estates of the realm were the cler-
gy, barons, and knights. In legal practice the lords spirit-
ual and lords temporal are usually collectively designated
under the one name lords. Webster, Dict.
ESTENDARD, ESTENDART, or STANDARD. An
ensign for horsemen in war.

## ESTER

A compound ether derived from oxy-
genated acid. E. I. Du Pont De Nemours & Co. v.
Byrnes, D.C.N.Y., 1 F.R.D. 34, 36.

## ESTER IN JUDGMENT

L. Fr. To appear be-
fore a tribunal either as plaintiff or defendant.
Kelham.

## ESTIMATE

A valuing or rating by the mind,
without actually measuring, weighing, or the like.
City of Tulsa v. Weston, 102 Okl. 222, 229 P. 108,
122. A rough or approximate calculation only.
Bair v. Montrose, 58 Utah 398, 199 P. 667, 669;

P. M. Hennessy Const. Co. v. Hart, 141 Minn. 449,
170 N.W. 579, 598. Thus, a census is a finding of
the population, not an "estimate." State ex rel.
Reynolds v. Jost, 265 Mo. 51, 175 S.W. 591, 597,
Ann.Cas.1917D, 1102.
This word is used to express the mind or judgment of
the speaker or writer on the particular subject under con-
sideration. It implies a calculation or computation, as to
estimate the gain or loss of an enterprise. People v. Clark,
37 Hun, N.Y., 203; New Orleans Terminal Co. v. Dixie
Rendering, La.App., 179 So. 98, 100.
As used in a contract for the sale of an estimated quanti-
ty of goods, "estimated" may mean practically the same
1112, 1115. Generally, the word "estimated" indicates that
a statement of quantity is a matter of description, and not
of the essence of the contract. Biglione v. Bronge, 192 Cal.
167, 219 P. 69, 70.

## ESTIMATED COST

The "estimated cost" of a
building means the reasonable cost of a building
erected in accordance with the plans and specifica-
tions referred to, and not necessarily the amount
of some actual estimate made by a builder, nor
an estimate agreed upon by the parties, nor yet
an estimate or bid accepted by the defendant.
New Orleans Terminal Co. v. Dixie Rendering, La,
App., 179 So. 98, 100.

## ESTOP

To stop, bar, or impede; to prevent; to
preclude. Co.Litt 352a; Olsgard v. Lemke, 32 N.
D. 551, 156 N.W. 102, 103. See Estoppel,
ESTOPPEL. A man's own act or acceptance
stops or closes his mouth to allege or plead the
truth. Caulfield v. Noonan, 229 Iowa 955, 295 N.
W. 466, 471; Williams v. Edwards, 163 Okl, 246,
22 P.2d 1026.
An estoppel arises when one is concluded and forbidden
by law to speak against his own act or deed. Gural v.
Engle, 128 N,J.L, 252, 25 A.2d 257, 261; an inconsistent
position, attitude or course of conduct may not be adopted
to loss or injury of another. Brand v. Farmers Mut. Pro-

Estoppels are sometimes said to be of three kinds: (1)
by deed; (2) by matter of record; (3) by matter in pais.
The first two are also called legal estoppels, as distin-
guished from the last kind, known as equitable estoppels.
Acts and Declarations
An "estoppel by acts and declarations" is such
as arises from the acts and declarations of a per-
son by which he designedly induces another to al-
ter his position injuriously to himself. Brauch V.
Peking, 219 Iowa 556, 258 N.W. 892,
Adjudication Distinguished
"Adjudication" and an "estoppel" from relitigating
things are different in that there is an adjudication when
a suit is repeated, but that there may be an estoppel be-
cause some fact which is controlling in both actions was
litigated and set at rest in first action. Kunkel v. Eastern
Iowa Light & Power Co-Op., 232 Iowa 649, 5 N.W.2d 899,
Common Law
"Estoppel at common law" includes estoppel by record,
estoppel by deed, and certain cases of estoppel in pais
which are recognized in courts of law. Thomas v. Conyers,
198 N.C. 229, 151 S.E. 270, 273.
Election Distinguished
"Election" differs from an "estoppel in pais" in that in
order to be effective it need not be acted upon by the other
party by way of a detrimental change of his position,
provided the election is a decisive one. Phillips v. Rooker,
134 Tenn. 457, 184 S.W. 12, 14.
Estoppel Against Estoppel
Doctrine that two estoppels may destroy each
other, or that one estoppel may set another at
large. Shean v. United States Fidelity & Guaran-
ty Co., 263 Mich. 535, 248 N.W. 892, 893.
In wife's divorce suit, evidence showed that wife in
procuring void Nevada divorce decree was under husband's
duress, domination, and compulsion, and hence there arose
an "estoppel against estoppel" destroying each other, and
decree. Lippincott v. Lippincott, 141 Neb. 186, 3 N.W.2d
207, 215, 140 A.L.R. 901.
Fraud
Estoppel is a penalty paid by perpetrator of
wrong by affirmative act which, though without
fraudulent intent, may result in legal fraud on
another. Harris v. Prince, Tex.Civ.App., 98 S.W.•
2d 1022, 1026.
A judgment procured by fraud may not be used as the
basis of an "estoppel". Seubert v. Seubert, 68 S.D. 195,
299 N.W. 873, 875; Actual or intended fraud is not an es-
sential element of estoppel, but estoppel arises when
omission to speak is an actual or constructive fraud. Kel-
ley-Springfield Tire Co. v. Stein, 163 Misc. 393, 297 N.Y.S.
22, 26. An act done which cannot be contravened without
fraud may be basis of estoppel, Tradesmens Nat. Bank of
New Haven v. Minor, 122 Conn. 419, 190 A. 270, 272, An es-
sential element of "equitable estoppel" is fraudulent in-
tent. Fleishbein v. Western Auto Supply Agency, 19 Cal.
App.2d 424, 65 P.2d 928; An estoppel does not require a
showing of fraudulent intent. New Jersey Suburban Water
Co. v. Town of Harrison, 122 N.J.L. 189, 3 A.2d 623, 625,
626, 627; An estoppel may arise although there is no de-
signed fraud. Laraway v. First Nat. Bank of La Verne, 39
Cal.App.2d 718, 104 P.2d 95, 101; Estoppel is an equitable
principle dependent on fraud. Volk v. City of New York,
259 App.Div. 247, 19 N.Y.S.2d 53, 60.
Intent
"Estoppel" in its broadest sense is penalty paid
by one perpetrating wrong by known fraud or by
affirmative act which, though without fraudulent
intent, may result in legal fraud on another. Har-
ris v. Prince, Tex.Civ.App., 98 S.W.2d 1022, 1026.
Actual or intended fraud is not an essential element of
estoppel but estoppel arises when omission to speak is an
actual or constructive fraud. Kelley-Springfield Tire Co.
v. Stein, 163 Misc. 393, 297 N.Y.S. 22, 26. Elements of
equitable, estoppel are representations intentionally made
under such circumstances as show that party making them
intended, or might reasonably have anticipated, that par-
ty to whom they are made, or to whom they are communi-
cated, will rely and act on them as true, Crane Co. of
Minnesota v. Advance Plumbing & Heating Co., 177 Minn.
132, 224 N.W. 847, 848. An essential element of equitable
estoppel is fraudulent intent but careless and culpable
conduct is equivalent to intent to deceive. Fleishbein v.
Western Auto Supply Agency, 19 Cal.App.2d 424, 65 P.2d
928. An estoppel arises when one by acts, representations,
admissions or silence intentionally induces another to
change his position for the worse. Smith v. Vara, 136
Misc. 500, 241 N.Y.S. 202, 209; American Exchange Nat.
Bank v. Winder, 198 N.C. 18, 150 S.E. 489, 491. An estoppel
does not require a showing of fraudulent intent. New
Jersey Suburban Water Co. v. Town of Harrison, 122 N.J.
L. 189, 3 A.2d 623, 625, 626, 627. An estoppel may arise
where there is no intent to mislead. Mancini v. Thomas,
113 Vt. 322, 34 A.2d 105, 109.
Legal Title to Land
Estoppel affecting legal title to land requires
conduct amounting to knowing representation or
concealment relied on by other party changing his
position for the worse. Crane v. Esmond, 214
Wis. 571, 253 N.W. 780.
It requires conduct amounting to representation or con-
cealment of material facts known to party estopped at time
of conduct, or at least under circumstances necessarily im-
puting knowledge thereof, and truth concerning such facts
must be unknown to other party claiming benefit of es-
toppel, with further requirement that conduct was done
with intention or expectation that it would be acted on,
and other party led to act thereon in reliance on conduct
so as to change his position for the worse. Jacksonville
Public Service Corporation v. Calhoun Water Co., 219 Ala.
See Representation, Estoppel By.
Pleading
Pleader must allege and prove not only that
person sought to be estopped made misleading
statements and representations but that pleader
actually believed and relied on them and was mis-
led to his injury thereby. Stanolind Oil & Gas Co.
v. Midas Oil Co., Tex.Civ.App., 173 S.W.2d 342,
A plea, replication, or other pleading, which, without
confessing or denying the matter of fact adversely alleged,
relies merely on some matter of estoppel as a ground for
excluding the opposite party from the allegation of the
fact. Steph.P1. 219; 3 Bl.Comm. 308.
A plea which neither admits nor denies the facts alleged
by the plaintiff, but denies his right to allege them. Gould,
Pl. c. 2, § 39.
A special plea in bar, which happens where a man has
done some act or executed some deed which precludes him
from averring anything to the contrary. 3 Bl.Comm. 308.
A pleader is not "estopped" by judicial allegations which
have neither deceived nor damaged anyone. Thomas v.
Leonard Truck Lines, La.App., 7 So.2d 753, 756; Hearon
v. Davis, La.App., 8 So.2d 787, 791.
Person pleading estoppel must have been misled to his
injury by acts of omission or commission of him who is
sought to be estopped. Selber Bros. v. Newstadt's Shoe
Stores, 203 La. 316, 14 So.2d 10; 13.
Plea of estoppel lacks merit unless it appears that op-
posing litigant has been misled, deceived or has suffered
damage from the allegations of pleader. Mounger v. Fer-
rell, La.App., 11 So.2d 56, 60.
Plea of "estoppel" was fatally defective where there was
no statement that defendant relied on course alleged to
have been taken by plaintiff. Sertic v. Roberts, 171 Or. 121,
136 P.2d 248, 251.
Statements in pleading in former action which are mere-
ly assertions of conclusion of law do not constitute "es-
toppel by pleading." Smith v. Saulsberry, 157 Wash. 270,
288 P. 927, 930.
Ratification Distinguished
The substance of "estoppel" is the inducement
of another to act to his prejudice. The substance
of "ratification" is confirmation after conduct.
Citizens State Bank of Thedford v. United States
Fidelity & Guaranty Co. of Baltimore, Md., 130
Neb. 603, 266 N.W. 81, 84, 103 A.L.R. 1401; Cudahy
Bros. Co. v. West Michigan Dock & Market Corpo-
ration, 285 Mich. 18, 280 N.W. 93, 95; Gillihan v.
Morguelan, 299 Ky. 671, 186 S.W.2d 807, 809.
By ratification party is bound because he intended to be,
while under "estoppel" he is bound because other party
will be prejudiced unless the law treats him as legally
bound. Carlile v. Harris, Tex.Civ.App., 38 S.W.2d 622,
624; doctrine of ratification is based on fact of intention
to carry out terms of certain agreement, while doctrine of
estoppel is based on right of party to deny existence of
agreement by reason of misleading acts. B. F. C. Morris
Co. v. Mason, 171 Okl. 589, 39 P.2d 1, 3; Ratification re-
quires no change of position or prejudice. Texas & Pacific
Coal & Oil Co. v. Kirtley, Tex.Civ.App., 288 S.W. 619, 622.
Ratification is retroactive and validates all of the act in-
volved, while estoppel extends only to so much of the act
as is affected by the conduct working the estoppel. Wood-
worth v. School Dist. No. 2, Stevens County, 92 Wash. 456,
1.59 P. 757, 760. Generally speaking, "ratification" applies
to a formal declaration of the approval of another's act,
whereas "estoppel" is where the party is bound by his
own act, but the legal effect is the same. Zenos v. Britten-
Cook Land & Live Stock Co., 75 Cal.App. 299, 242 P. 914,
917; Marian Say. Bank v. Leahy, 200 Iowa 220, 204 N.W.
156, 458.
Recital
The theory of "estoppel by recital" is that holder
of instrument is entitled to rely upon facts recit-
ed therein. Bloomfield Village Drain Dist. v.
Keefe, C.C.A.Mich., 119 F.2d 157, 163, 165.
Res Judicata Distinguished
A prior judgment between same parties, which
is not strictly res judicata because based upon dif-
ferent cause of action, operates as an "estoppel"
only as to matters actually in issue or points con-
troverted. JEtna Life Ins. Co. of Hartford, Conn.,
v. Martin, C.C.A.Ark., 108 F.2d 824, 827; Cunning-
ham v. Oklahoma City, 188 Okl. 466, 110 P.2d 1102,
Doctrine that issues decided may not be drawn in ques-
tion in any future action between same parties or their
privies, whether cause of action in the two actions be
identical or different, is based on "estoppel" rather than
upon "res judicata". Norwood v. McDonald, 142 Ohio St.
299, 52 N.E.2d 67, 71, 74; In a later action upon a different
cause of action a judgment operates as an "estoppel" only
as to such issues in second action as were actually de-
termined in the first action. Lorber v. Vista Irr. Dist., C.
C.A.Cal., 127 F.2d 628, 634. The doctrine of "res judicata"
is a branch of law of "estoppel". Krisher v. McAllister, 71
Ohio App. 58, 47 N.E.2d 817, 819; The plea of "res judicata"
is in its nature an "estoppel" against the losing party
from again litigating matters involved in previous action,
but the plea does not have that effect as to matters trans-
piring subsequently. Fort Worth Stockyards Co. v. Brown,
Tex.Civ.App., 161 S.W.2d 549, 555. Where a second action
between same parties involves different cause of action,
under doctrine of "res judicata", judgment in first action
operates as an "estoppel" only as to those matters which
were in issue and actually litigated. International Broth-
erhood of Electrical Workers v. Bridg,eman, 179 Va. 533, 19
S. E.2d 667, 670.
Stare Decisis
The doctrine of "stare decisis" is but an appli-
cation of the doctrine of "estoppel." Brown v.
Rosenbaum, 175 Misc. 295, 23 N.Y.S.2d 161, 171;
The doctrine of "stare decisis" involves no element
of "estoppel". Joslin v. State, Tex.Civ.App., 146
S.W.2d 208, 212.
Suppression
The doctrine of "estoppel by concealment and
suppression" applies only where there has been
reduction to practice of invention. Bogoslowsky
v. Huse, 142 F.2d 75, 76, 31 C.C.P.A. (Patents) 1034.
Waiver Distinguished
Waiver is intentional relinquishment of a known
right. Globe Indemnity Co. v. Cohen, C.C.A.Pa.,
106 F.2d 687, 691; Beatty v. Employers' Liability
Assur. Corporation, 106 Vt. 25, 168 A. 919, 922;
but may be more narrowly and accurately defined
as intended giving up of known privilege or pow-
er. John Alt Furniture Co. v. Maryland Casualty.
Co., C.C.A.Mo., 88 F.2d 36, 41. Waiver is volun-
tary and intentional. Insurance Co. of North
America v. Williams, 42 Ariz. 331, 26 P.2d 117, 119;
Sentinel Fire Ins. Co. v. McRoberts, 50 Ga.App.
732, 179 S.E. 256. Waiver is voluntary surrender
or relinquishment of some known right, benefit or
advantage; estoppel is the inhibition to assert
it. Benson v. Borden, 174 Md. 202, 198 A. 419,
427, 428; Johnston v. Columbian Nat. Life Ins.
Co., 130 Me. 143, 154 A. 79, 80.
Acts, conduct or declarations insufficient to create a
technical estoppel may create a waiver. Benson v. Borden,
174 Md. 202, 198 A. 419, 427, 428. Acts or conduct of only
one of the parties is involved in waiver while an estoppel
may arise where there is no intent to mislead. Beatty v.
Employers' Liability Assur. Corporation, 106 Vt. 25, 168 A.
919, 922; Benson v. Borden, 174 Md. 202, 198 A. 419, 427,
428. Actual intent to abandon or surrender right is es-
sential in waiver and immaterial in estoppel. Equitable
Life Assur. Soc. of U. S. v. Pettid, 40 Ariz. 239, 11 P.2d
833, 838; Boyce v. Toke Point Oyster Co., Consol., 145 Or.
114, 25 P.2d 930; Actual or constructive fraudulent conduct
is essential to estoppel but not to waiver. Insurance Co.
of North America v. Williams, 42 Ariz. 331, 26 P.2d 117,
119; An act which operates to injury of other party is
essential to estoppel whereas there may be a waiver, al-
though the opposite party is beneficially affected. Sentinel
Fire Ins. Co. v. McRoberts, 50 Ga.App. 732, 179 S.E. 256;
Conduct or dealings with another by which other is induced
to act or to forbear to act is basis of estoppel whereas
waiver is intentional relinquishment of a known right. De
Pasquale v. Union Indemnity Co., 50 R.I. 509, 149 A. 795;
Reynolds v. Travelers' Ins. Co., 176 Wash. 36, 28 P.2d 310,
314. Estoppel results from an act which operates to the
injury of the other party, while waiver may even affect
him beneficially. City of Glendale v. Coquat, 46 Ariz. 478,
52 P.2d 1178, 1180, 102 A.L.R. 837. Fraud may be implied
in estoppel but never in waiver. City of Glendale v. Co-
quat, 46 Ariz. 478, 52 P.2d 1178, 1180, 102 A.L.R. 837;
Benson v. Borden, 174 Md. 202, 198 A. 419, 427, 428. Ignor-
ance of party who invokes estoppel, representations or con-
duct of party estopped which misled, and an innocent and
deleterious change of position in reliance upon such repre-
sentations or conduct are essential to estoppel whereas
waiver is an intentional relinquishment. Ellis v. Metro-
politan Casualty Ins. Co. of New York, 187 S.C. 162, 197 S.
E. 510; Knowledge and intention are both involved in,
waiver while an estoppel may arise where there is no in-
tent to mislead. Benson v. Borden, 174 Md. 202, 198 A.
419, 427, 428; Beatty v. Employers' Liability Assur. Corpo-
ration, 106 Vt. 25, 168 A. 919, 922. Misleading of party to
his injury or prejudice or into altered position is essential
to estoppel but not to waiver. A-1 Cleaners & Dyers v. Amer-
ican Mut. Liability Ins. Co. of Boston, 307 Ill.App. 64, 30 N.
E.2d 87, 88; Beatty v. Employers' Liability Assur. Corpo-
ration, 106 Vt. 25, 168 A. 919, 922. Waiver consists merely
in renouncing some right or in ratifying what one might
repudiate. Williams v. Anaconda Copper Mining Co., 96
Mont. 204, 29 P.2d 649, 651. Waiver depends on what one
party intends to do, rather than upon what he induces his
adversary to do, as in "estoppel". Nathan Miller, Inc., v.
Northern Ins. Co. of New York, 3 Terry 523, 39 A.2d 23, 25;
Wisdom v. Board of Sup'rs of Polk County, 236 Iowa 669,
19 N.W.2d 602, 610.
Implied waiver is kin to estoppel and rests on course of
conduct evidencing intention not to insist on some perform-
ance due. Kansas City Life Ins. Co. v. Davis, C.C.A.Cal.,
95 F.2d 952, 957. It does not necessarily include all ele-
ments of estoppel. Smith v. Coutant, 232 Iowa 887, 6 N.W.
2d 421, 425.
Legal effect of waiver and estoppel is the same. Wood-
men of the World Life Ins. Soc. v. Greathouse, 242 Ala. 532,
7 So.2d 89, 91.
Technically, a distinction exists between "waiver" and
"estoppel" but under insurance law, terms are used inter-
changeably. Boyle Road & Bridge Co. v. American Em-
ployers' Ins. Co. of Boston, Mass., 195 S.C. 397, 11 S.E.2d
438, 440, 441; The doctrine of waiver, as asserted against
insurance companies to avoid the strict enforcement of con-
ditions contained in their policies, is only another name for
the doctrine of estoppel. Rushville Nat. Bank of Rush-
ville v. State Life Ins. Co., 210 Ind. 492, 1 N.E.2d 445, 448.
While there are distinguishing features between "waiver"
and "estoppel," waiver belongs to family of estoppel and
the terms are frequently used as meaning the same thing
in law of insurance contracts. Ellis v. Metropolitan Cas-
ualty Ins. Co. of New York, 187 S.C. 162, 197 S.E. 510, 512.
Warranty
An estoppel based on principle of giving effect
to manifest intent of grantor and of preventing
grantor from derogating or destroying his own

A writ for a wife
judicially separated to recover her alimony or es-
tovers. Obsolete.

## ESTOVERS

The right to use,- during lease, what-
ever timber there may be on leased premises nec-
essary to promote good husbandry. Hood v. Fos-
ter, 194 Miss. 812, 13 So.2d 652, 653.
An allowance made to a person out of an estate
or other thing for his or her support, as for food
and raiment.

mony") granted to a woman divorced a mensa et
thoro, for her support out of her husband's estate.
1 Bl.Comm. 441.
The right or privilege which a tenant has to furnish
himself with so much wood from the demised premises as
may be sufficient or necessary for his fuel, fences, and oth-
er agricultural operations. 2 Bl.Comm. 35; Woodf.Landl.
& Ten. 232; Zimmerman v. Shreeve, 59 Md. 363; Van
Rensselaer v. Radcliff, 10 Wend. (N.Y.) 639, 25 Am. Dec.
There is much learning in the old books relative to the
creation, apportionment, suspension, and extinguishment
of these rights, very little of which, however, is applicable
to the condition of things in this country, except perhaps
in New York, where the grants of the manor-lands have led
to some litigation on the subject. Tayl.Landl. & T. § 220.
See 4 Wash.R.P. 99; 7 Bing. 640; Richardson v. York, 14
Me. 221; Dalton v. Dalton, 42 N.C. 197; Loomis v. Wilbur,
5 Mas. 13, Fed.Cas.No.8,498.
Common of estovers, see Common.

## ESTRAY

Cattle whose owner is unknown. 2
Kent, Comm. 359; Spelman. Any beast, not wild,
found within any lordship, and not owned by any
man. Cowell; 1 Bl.Comm. 297. These belonged
to the lord of the soil. Britt. c. 17. An animal
that has strayed away and lost itself; a wander-
ing beast which no one seeks, follows, or claims.
Campbell v. Hamilton, 42 N.D. 216, 172 N.W. 810.
Estray must be understood as denoting a wandering
beast whose owner is unknown to the person who takes it
up. An estray is an animal that has escaped from its
owner, and wanders or strays about; usually defined, at
common law, as a wandering animal whose owner is
unknown. An animal cannot be an estray when on the
range where it was raised, and permitted by its owner to
run, and especially when the owner is known to the party
who takes it up. The fact of its being breachy or vicious
does not make it an estray. Kinney v. Roe, 70 Iowa, 509,
Gipson, 18 Pick., Mass., 426; but see Worthington v. Brent,
69 Mo. 205; State v. Apel, 14 Tex. 431.
Heifers trespassing unattended upon adjoining ranch
when taken up held "estrays" within Estray Act even if
heifers' owners were known, since act covers animals
belonging to known as well as to unknown owners. Soares
v. Ghisletta, 1 Cal.App.2d 402, 36 P.2d 668, 669.
The term is used of flotsam at sea. 15 L.Q.R.

## ESTREAT

To take out a forfeited recogniz-
ance from the records of a court, and return it to
the court of exchequer, to be prosecuted. See
Estreat, n.
A forfeited recognizance taken out from among the other
records for the purpose of being sent up to the exchequer,
that the parties might be sued thereon, was said to be
estreated. 4 Bi.Comm. 253. And see Louisiana Society v.
Cage, 45 La.Ann. 1394, 14 So. 422.
There is no "estreat" or taking a judgment of forfeiture
of a bail recognizance from the records and sending it up
to the exchequer for suit thereon in Louisiana, since the
same court which renders a judgment executes it, and the
same officers who are charged with procuring it to be ren-
dered are also charged with procuring it to be executed.
State v. Johnson, 132 La. 11, 60 So. 702, 703.

## ESTREAT

(From Lat. extractum.) In Eng-
lish law. A copy or extract from the book of es-
treats, that is, the rolls of any court, in which the
amercements or fines, recognizances, etc., imposed
or taken by that court upon or from the accused,
are set down, and which are to be levied by the
bailiff or other officer of the court. Cowell;
Brown. A true copy or note of some original writ-
ing or record, and especially of fines and amerce-
ments imposed by a court, extracted from the rec-
ord, and certified to a proper officer or officers
authorized and required to collect them. Fitzh.

of a reversionary interest by stripping or spoiling
the estate.

## ESTREPEMENT

A species of aggravated
waste, by stripping or devastating the land, to the
injury of the reversioner, and especially pending
a suit for possession.

## ESTREPEMENT, WRIT OF

This was a com-
mon-law writ of waste, which lay in particular
for the reversioner against the tenant for life, in
respect of damage or injury to the land commit-
ted by the latter.
As it was only auxiliary to a real action for recovery of
the land, and as equity afforded the same relief by injunc-
tion, the writ fell into disuse in England, and was abol-
ished by 3 & 4 Will. IV. c. 27. In Pennsylvania, by statute,
the remedy by estrepement is extended for the benefit of
specified persons. See 10 Viner, Abr. 497; Woodf. Landl.
& T. 447; Arch.Civ.PL 17; 7 Com.Dig. 659; Byrne v.
Boyle, 37 Pa. 260.
ESTUARY, is that part of the mouth or lower
course of a river flowing into the sea which is
subject to tide; especially, an enlargement of a
river channel toward its mouth in which the move-
ment of the tide Is very prominent. Alameda

in and law French phrases formerly in common
use.

Falls Indemnity Co. v. Manning, La.App., 168 So.
787, 788. ,
Where the words "et al." are used in a judgment against
defendants, the quoted words include all defendants. Wil-
liams v. Williams, 25 Tenn.App. 290, 156 S.W.2d 363, 369.
ET ALIT it CONTRA. And others on the other
side.
A phrase constantly used in the Year Books, in describ-
ing a joinder in issue. P. 1 Edw. II. Prist; et alii 6 con-
tra, et sic ad patriam: ready; and others, it contra, and
so to the country. T. 3 Edw. III. 4.

## ET ALIUS

And another.
The abbreviation et al. (sometimes in the plural written
et als.) is often affixed to the name of the person first men-
tioned, where there are several plaintiffs, grantors, persons
addressed, etc. See In re McGovern's Estate, 77 Mont. 182,

171 S.W. 1179; Fleck v. Harmstad, 304 Pa. 302,
155 A. 875, 877, 77 A.L.R. 874. In its abbreviated
form (etc.) this phrase is frequently affixed to one
of a series of articles or names to show that
others are intended to follow or understood to be
included. So, after reciting the initiatory words
of a set formula, or a clause already given in full,
etc. is added, as an abbreviation, for the sake of
convenience. And other things of like kind or
purpose as compared with those immediately
theretofore mentioned. Hisaw v. Ellison Ridge

a series of articles or names to show that others are in-
tended to follow or understood to be included so, after re-

the sake of convenience. See Lathers v. Keogh, 39 Hun,
N.Y., 579; Morton v. Young, 173 Ky. 301, 190 S.W. 1090;

## ET DE CEO SE METTENT EN LE PAYS

L. Fr.
And of this they put themselves upon the country.

## ET DE HOC PONIT SE SUPER PATRIAM

And
of this he puts himself upon the country. The

way of traverse. See 3 Bl.Comm. 313. The liter-
al translation is retained in the modern form.

it is read to him in these words. Words formerly
used in entering the prayer of oyer on record.

## ET HABEAS IBI TUNC HOC BREVE

## ET HABUIT

And he had it.
A common phrase in the Year Books, expressive of the
allowance of an application or demand by a party. Parn.
demands la view. Et habuit, etc. M. 6 Edw. III. 49.

## ET HOC PARATUS EST VERIFICARE

And
this he is prepared to verify.
The Latin form of concluding a plea in confession and
avoidance; that is, where the defendant has confessed all
that the plaintiff has set forth, and has pleaded new matter
in avoidance. 1 Salk. 2.
These words were used, when the pleadings were in
Latin, at the conclusion of any pleading which contained
new affirmative matter. They expressed the willingness or
readiness of the party so pleading to establish by proof the
matter alleged in his pleading. A pleading which con-
cluded in that manner was technically said to "conclude
with a verification," in contradistinction to a pleading
which simply denied matter alleged by the opposite party,
and which for that reason was said to "conclude to the
country," because the party merely put himself upon the
country, or left the matter to the jury. Brown.

## ET HOC PETIT QUOD INQUIRATUR PER PA- TRIAM

And this he prays may be inquired of
by the country. The conclusion of a plaintiff's
pleading, tendering an issue to the country. 1
Salk. 6. Literally translated in the modern forms.

he brings suit. The Latin conclusion of a dec-
laration, except against attorneys and other of-
ficers of the court. 3 Bl.Comm. 295.

## ET MODO AD HUNG DIEM

Lat. And now at
this day. This phrase was the formal beginning
of an entry of appearance or of a continuance.
The equivalent English words are still used in
ET NON. Lat. And not. A technical phrase in
pleading, which introduces the negative averments
of a special traverse. It has the same force and
effect as the words absque hoc, "without this,"
and is occasionally used instead of the latter.

## ET SEQ

An abbreviation for et sequentes (mas-
culine and feminine plural) or et sequentia (neu-
ter), "and the following." Thus a reference to
"p. 1, et seq." means "page first and the follow-
ing pages." Also abbreviated "et sqq.," which is
preferred by some authorities for a reference to
more than one following page.

## ET SIC

And so. In the Latin forms of plead-
ing these were the introductory words of a spe-
cial conclusion to a plea in bar, the object being to
render it positive and not argumentative; as et
sic nil debet.

## ET UX

An abbreviation for et uxor,—"and
wife." Where a grantor's wife joins him in the
conveyance, it is sometimes expressed (in ab-
stracts, etc.) to be by "A. B. et ux."
ETCHING. Strictly, the art of using acid to bite
a design on metal; in a broader sense, the word
includes the sand-blast process, which uses no
acid, but relies on abrasion by sand, emery, or a
like substance. Graphic Arts Co. v. Photo-Chrom-
otype Engraving Co., C.C.A.Pa., 231 F. 146, 148.

## ETERNAL SECURITY

The doctrine of "etern-
al security" means that once one becomes a Chris-
tian or has been "regenerated" his future conduct,
no matter what it may be, will not jeopardize his
salvation. Ashman v. Studebaker, 115 Ind.App.
73, 56 N.E.2d 674, 678.

## ETHICAL

tive or character; as, ethical emotion; also, treat-
ing ,,of moral feelings, duties or conduct; con-
taining precepts of morality; moral"; and sec-
ondarily as "professionally right or befitting; con-

The code
of honor agreed on by mutual understanding and
tacitly accepted by members of the legal profes-
sion, especially by the bar. Wharton.
EUM QUI NOCENTEM INFAMAT, NON EST
.IEQUUM ET BONUM OB EAM REM CONDEM-
NARI; DELICTA ENIM NOCENTIUM NOTA
ESSE OPORTET ET EXPEDIT. It is not just
and proper that he who speaks ill of a bad man
should be condemned on that account; for it is
fitting and expedient that the crimes of bad men
should be known. Dig. 47, 10, 17; 1 Bl.Comm. 125.

## EUNDO, MORANDO, ET REDEUNDO

Lat.
Going, remaining, and returning.
A person who is privileged from arrest (as a witness,
legislator, etc.) is generally so privileged eundo, morando,
at redeundo; that is, on his way to the place where his
duties are to be performed, while he remains there, and
on his return journey.

## EUNDO ET REDEUNDO

Lat. In going and re-
turning. Applied to vessels. 3 C.Rob.Adm. 141.

Amusement Co., 129 Tex. 40, 100 S.W.2d 695, 701.
A subtle endeavoring to set aside truth or to es-
cape the punishment of the law.
Thus, If one person says to another that he will not
strike him, but will give him a pot of ale to strike first,
and, accordingly, the latter strikes, the returning the blow
is punishable; and, if the person first striking is killed, it
it is murder, for no man shall evade the justice of the law
by such a pretense. 1 Hawk.P.C. 81; Bac.Abr. Fraud, A.
So no one may plead Ignorance of the law to evade it.
Jacob.
Artifice or cunning is implicit in the term as applied to
contest between citizen and government over taxation.
Clapp v. Heiner, C.C.A.Pa., 51 F.2d 224, 225.
In a general way the words "suppression," "evasion,"
and "concealment" mean to avoid by some device or strat-
egy or the concealment or intentional withholding some
fact which ought in good faith to be communicated. Mur-
ray v. Brotherhood of American Yeomen, 180 Iowa, 626, 163
N.W. 421, 428.
When an act is condemned as an "evasion," what is
meant is that it is on the wrong side of the line indicated
by the policy if not by the mere letter of the law. Wynd-

if it does so, deprivation need not be permanent. Title &
Trust Co. v. Durkheimer Inv. Co., 155 Or. 427, 63 P.2d 909.

## EVASIVE ANSWER

One which consists in re-
fusing either to admit or to deny a matter as to
which the defendant is necessarily presumed to
have knowledge.
Hence, where a defendant is alleged to be a corporation,
an answer declining, for want of sufficient information,
either to admit or to deny such an averment would be
evasive. Raleigh & Gaston Ry. Co. v. Pullman Co., 122 Ga.
700, 50 S.E. 1008. But an answer distinctly denying an
allegation that the defendant is a corporation, although it
may be false, is not evasive. Gaynor v. Travelers' Ins. Co.,

## EVES-DROPPERS

## EVICT

Civil law. To recover anything from a
person by virtue of the judgment of a court or
Common law. To dispossess, or turn out of
the possession of lands by process of law. Also
to recover land by judgment at law. "If the land
is evicted, no rent shall be paid." 10 Coke, 128a.
The term "evicted," means deprivation by one of office,
or of salary attached thereto, to which another is, or may
be, entitled. The term "evicted" properly applies only to
realty and has been used to describe inability to get prom-
ised possession, and also, as deprivation of the possession
of lands and tenements. Hawkins v. Voisine, 292 Mich.
357, 290 N.W. 827, 828.
To "evict" a tenant is to deprive him of possession of
the leased premises or disturb him in their beneficial
enjoyment so as to cause tenant to abandon the premises.
Estes v. Gatliff, 291 Ky. 93, 163 S.W.2d 273, 276.

## EVICTION

Dispossession by process of law;
the act of depriving a person of the possession of
lands which he has held, in pursuance of the judg-
ment of a court. Reasoner v. Edmundson, 5 Ind.
395; Cowdrey v. Coit, 44 N.Y. 392, 4 Am.Rep. 690;
Home Life Ins. Co. v. Sherman, 46 N.Y. 372.
Originally and technically, the dispossession
must be by judgment of law; if otherwise, it was
an ouster; Webb v. Alexander, 7 Wend.N.Y. 285;
but the necessity of legal process was long ago
abandoned in England; 4 Term 617; and in this
country also it is settled that there. need not be
legal process; Green v. Irving, 54 Miss. 450, 28
Am.Rep. 360; Thomas v. Becker, 190 Iowa 237,
180 N.W. 285, 286. Any actual entry and dispos-
session, adversely and lawfully made under para-
mount title, will be an eviction. Rawle, Coy. §
133; Gallison v. Downing, 244 Mass. 33, 138 N.E.
315, 318.
In a more popular sense, the term denotes turn-
ing a tenant of land out of possession, either by
re-entry or by legal proceedings, such as an ac-
tion of ejectment. Sweet.
By a loose extension, the term is sometimes ap-
plied to the ousting of a person from the posses-
sion of chattels; but, properly, it applies only to
realty.
A wrongful act upon the part of the landlord is involved
in eviction. Cerruti v. Burdick, 130 Conn. 284, 33 A.2d 333,
An entry under paramount title, so as to interfere with
the rights of the grantee, is implied in eviction. The
object of the party making the entry is immaterial,
whether it be to take all or a part of the land itself or
merely an incorporeal right. Phrases equivalent in mean-
ing are "ouster by paramount title," "entry and disturb-
ance," "possession under an elder title," and the like.
Mitchell v. Warner, 5 Conn. 497.
An "eviction by title paramount" arises when a third
person establishes title to demised premises superior to
that of landlord, and by virtue of that title gains posses-
sion. John R. Thompson Co. v. Northwestern Mut. Life
Ins. Co., D.C.Ohio, 31 F.Supp. 399, 400.
Any act of landlord which deprives tenant of beneficial
enjoyment of premises. Adler v. Sklaroff, 154 Pa.Super.
444, 36 A.2d 231,,233.
Any wrong of lessor which results in substantial inter-
ference with lessee's rights. Harrison v. Fregger, 88 Mont.
448, 294 P. 372, 373.
Deprivation of lessee of possession of premises or dis-
turbance of lessee in beneficial enjoyment so as to cause
tenant to abandon the premises. Estes v. Gatliff, 291 Ky.
93, 163 S.W.2d 273, 276.
Dispossession of tenant by landlord. Lesher v. Louis-
Dispossession under judgment, though it need not be by
force of process under judgment. Edgemont Coal Co. v.
Asher, D.C.Ky., 298 F. 1000; Walker v. Robinson, 163 Ky.
618, 174 S. W. 503, 505.
Entry on and taking possession of any part of demised
premises by landlord during continuance of lease and
exclusion of tenant. Landon v. Hill, 136 Cal.App. 560, 29
P.2d 281, 282.
Formerly the word was used to denote an expulsion by
the assertion of a paramount title or by process of law.
Port Utilities Commission of Charleston v. Marine Oil Co.,
173 S.C. 345, 175 S.E. 818.
Intentional exclusion of lessee from some part of leased
premises. Gorfinkle v. Abrams, 263 Mass. 569, 161 N.E.

ises. Peale v. Tvete, 172 Wash. 296, 20 P.2d 12, 13; Kahn
v. Bancamerica-Blair Corporation, 327 Pa. 209, 193 A. 905,
Manual or physical explusion or exclusion from demised
premises, or any part thereof is unnecessary to constitute
eviction. Kennerly v. B. F. Avery & Sons Plow Co., Tex.
Civ.App., 300 S.W. 159, 161.
Originally an eviction was understood to be a disposses-
sion of the tenant by some act of his landlord or the fail-
ure of his title. Of later years it has come to include any
wrongful act of the landlord which may result in an inter-
ference with the tenant's possession in whole or in part.
The act may be one of omission as well as one of commis-
sion. Holden v. Tidwell, 37 Old. 553, 133 P. 54, 56, 49
L.R.A.,N.S., 369.
Something of a grave and permanent character by land-
lord or those acting under his authority with intent and
effect to deprive tenant of use, occupation, and enjoyment
of premises or part thereof, or the establishment or asser-
tion against tenant of a title paramount to the landlord.
Blomberg v. Evans, 194 N.C. 113, 138 S.E. 593, 594, 53
A.L.R. 686; Aguglia v. Cavicchia, 229 Mass. 263, 118 N.E.

Action Corporation, 340 Ill. 196, 172 N.E. 35, 37, 69 A.L.R.
When it would be useless for covenantee to attempt to
maintain his title, as where holder of superior title has
taken actual possession or threatens suit, an eviction occurs
in legal contemplation. Love v. Minerva Petroleum Corpo-
ration, Tex.Civ.App., 105 S.W.2d 892, 894.
When tenant's possession or enjoyment of premises is
interfered with by a third person not acting by landlord's
authority, or consent, there is no "eviction". Smith v.
Nortz Lumber Co., N.D., 72 N.D. 353, 7 N.W.2d 435, 437;
Prospect Point Land Improvement Co. v. Jackson, 109
N.J.L. 385, 162 A. 576, 577.
Civil Law

thing, in pursuance of a sentence by which he is con-
demned to do so. Poth.Contr.Sale, pt. 2, c. 1, § 2, art. 1,
no. 83. The abandonment which a buyer is compelled to

action arises. Bract. fol. 99; Fleta, lib. 2, c. 56, • §
3; Plowd. 305. Out of a promise neither attend-
ed with particular solemnity (such as belongs to
a specialty) nor with any consideration no legal

eral ex officio on behalf of the crown, in the court
of king's bench, for offenses more immediately af-
fecting the government, and to be distinguished
from informations in which the crown is the
nominal prosecutor. Mozley & Whitley; 4 Steph.
Comm. 372-378.

## EX OFFICIO OATH

An oath taken by offending
priests; abolished by 13 Car. II. St. 1, c. 12.

## EX OFFICIO SERVICES

law annexes to a particular office and requires
the incumbent to perform. City of Birmingham
v. Hawkins, 208 Ala. 79, 94 So. 62, 64; Nichols v.
Galveston County, 111 Tex. 50, 228 S.W. 547, 548.
"Ex officio services," which deputy attorney general may

Broom, Max. 742. See 7 Clark & F. 729.

## EX PARTE

On one side only; by or for one
party; done for, in behalf of, or on the applica-
tion of, one party only.
A judicial proceeding, order, injunction, etc., is said to be
ex parte when it is taken or granted at the instance and for
the benefit of one party only, and without notice to, or
contestation by, any person adversely interested. Janin v.
Logan, 209 Ky. 811, 273 S.W. 531, 532; Van Alen v. Supe-
rior Court in and for Los Angeles County, 37 Cal.App. 696,
174 P. 672; Stella v. Mosele, 299 53, 19 N.E.2d 433,
In its primary sense, ex parte, as applied to an applica-
tion in a judicial proceeding, means that it is made by a
person who is not a party to the proceeding, but who has
an interest in the matter which entitles him to make the
application. Thus, in a bankruptcy proceeding or an
administration action, an application by A. B., a creditor,
or the like, would be described as made "ex parte A. B.,"
e., on the part of A. B.
In its more usual sense, ex parte means that an applica-
tion is made by one party to a proceeding in the absence
of the other. Thus, an ex parte injunction is one granted
without the opposite party having had notice of the appli-
cation. It would not be called "ex parte" if he had proper
notice of it, and chose not to appear to oppose it. Sweet.
"Ex parte," in the heading of a reported case,
signifies that the name following is that of the
party upon whose application the case is heard.

## EX PARTE MATERNA

On the mother's side;
of the maternal line.

## EX PARTE PATERNA

On the father's side;
of the paternal line.
The phrases "ex parte materna" and "ex parte paterna"
denote the line or blood of the mother or father, and have
no, such restricted or limited sense as from the mother or
father exclusively. Banta v. Demarest, 24 N.J.L. 431.

## EX PARTE TALIS

A writ that lay for a bailiff
or receiver, who, having auditors appointed to
take his accounts, cannot obtain of them reason-
able allowance, but is cast into prison. Fitzh.
Nat. Brev. 129.

## EX PAUCIS DICTIS INTENDERE PLURIMA POSSIS

Litt. § 384. You can imply many things
from few expressions.
EX PAUCIS PLURIMA CONCIPIT INGENIUM.
Litt. § 550. From a few words or hints the under-
standing conceives many things.

## EX POST FACTO

After the fact; by an act or
fact occurring after some previous act or fact,
and relating thereto; by subsequent matter; the
opposite of ab initio. Thus, a deed may be good
ab inittio, or, if invalid at its inception, may be
,
confirmed by matter ex post facto.

## EX POST FACTO LAW

A law passed after the
occurrence of a fact or commission of an act,
which retrospectively changes the legal conse-
quences or relations of such fact or deed. By
Const. U. S. art. 1, § 10, the states are forbidden
to pass "any ex post facto law." In this connec-
tion the phrase has a much narrower meaning
than its literal translation would justify, as will
appear from the extracts given below.
A statute which changes punishment which may be
imposed for a crime theretofore committed is "ex post
facto" only if it prescribes or permits imposition of a
greater sentence. People ex rel. Pincus v. Adams, 274 N.Y.
447, 9 N.E.2d 46, 110 A.L.R. 1303.
An "ex post facto law" has been defined as (1) Every law
that makes an action, done before the passing of the law,
and which was innocent when done, criminal, and punishes
such action. (2) Every law that aggravates a crime, or
makes it greater than it was when committed. (3) Every
law that changes the punishment, and inflicts a greater
punishment than the law annexed to the crime when corn-
mitted. (4) Every law that alters the legal rules of evi-
dence, and receives less or different testimony than the law
required at the time of the commission of the offense, in
order to convict the offender. All these, and similar laws,
are prohibited by the constitution. But a law may be ex
post facto, and still not amenable to this constitutional.
inhibition; that is, provided it mollifies, instead of aggra-
vating, the rigor of the criminal law. Cummings v. Mis-
souri, 4 Wall. 277, 18 L.Ed. 356; 3 Story, Const. 212; State
v. Malloy, 95 S.C. 441, 78 S.E. 995, 997, Ann.Cas.1915C, 1053;
In re Jamestown Caucus Law, 43 R.I. 421, 112 A. 900, 902;
State v. Teasley, 194 Ala. 574, 69 So. 723, 725, Ann.Cas.
1918E, 347; Beazell v. State of Ohio, 269 U.S. 167, 46 S.Ct.
68, 70 L.Ed. 216; Hernandez v. State, 43 Ariz. 424, 32 P.
2d 18, 24.
An "ex post facto law" includes every law that creates
and punishes a criminal offense which, when done before
the passing of the law, was innocent, and every law that
aggravates a crime or makes it greater than it was when
committed, and every law that inflicts a greater punish-
ment than was attached to the crime when committed.
State v. Pleason, 56 N. D. 499, 218 N.W. 154, 155.
An "ex post facto law" is defined as a law which provides
for the infliction of punishment upon a person for an act
done which, when it was committed, was innocent; a law
which aggravates a crime or makes it greater than when it
was committed; a law that changes the punishment or
inflicts a greater punishment than the law annexed to the
crime when it was committed ; a law that changes the rules
of evidence and receives less or different testimony than
was required at the time of the commission of the offense
in order to convict the offender; a law which, assuming to
regulate civil rights and remedies only, in effect imposes a
penalty or the deprivation of a right which, when done,
was lawful; a law which deprives persons accused of crime
of some lawful protection to which they have become enti-
tled, such as the protection of a former conviction or
acquittal, or of the proclamation of amnesty; every law
which, in relation to the offense or its consequences, alters
the situation of a person to his disadvantage. State v.
Rowe, 116 N.J.L. 48, 181 A. 706.
An "ex post facto law" is one which makes an act pun-
ishable in a manner in which it was not punishable when
it was committed. Statler v. U. S. Savings & Trust Co.,
122 Pa.Super. 189, 186 A. 290, 292; Southern Kraft Corpo-
ration v. Hardin, 205 Ark. 512, 169 S.W.2d 637, 643.
An "ex post facto law" is one which makes a crime of
an act which when committed was not a crime or a law
which increases the punishment for an act already com-
mitted. Commonwealth ex rel..Wall v. Smith, 345 Pa. 512,
29 A.2d 912, 913.
An "ex post facto law" is one which renders an act
punishable in manner in which it was not punishable when
it was committed, or which deprives accused of any sub-
stantial right or immunity possessed by him before its
passage as to prior offenses. People of U. S. ex rel.
Umbenhowar v. McDonnell, D.C.Ill., 11 F.Supp. 1014, 1015.
An ex post facto law is one which renders an act pun-
ishable in manner in which it was not punishable when
committed. Such a law may inflict penalties on the person,
or pecuniary penalties which swell the public treasury.
The legislature is therefore prohibited from passing a law
by which a man's estate, or any part of it, shall be seized
for a crime, which was not declared, by some previous law,
to render him liable to such punishment. Fletcher v. Peck,
6 Cranch, 87, 138, 3 L.Ed. 162.
An increase in possible penalty is "ex post facto" regard-
less of length of sentence actually imposed. Ex parte
Flora, Ohio App., 31 N.E.2d 482, 485.
The plain and obvious meaning of prohibition is that the
legislature shall not pass any law, after a fact done by any
citizen, which shall have relation to that fact, so as to
punish that which was innocent when done; or to add to
the punishment of that which was criminal; or to increase
the malignity of a crime; or to retrench the rules of evi-
dence, so as to make conviction more easy. This definition
of an ex post facto law is sanctioned by long usage. Strong
v. State, 1 Black., Ind., 196.
stitution, cannot be construed to include and to prohibit
the enacting any law after a fact, nor even to prohibit the
depriving a citizen of a vested right to property. Calder v.
Bull, 3 Da11. 386, 1 L.Ed. 648.
Any law passed after commission of offense for which the
defendant is tried which inflicts greater punishment or
which alters situation of accused is "ex post facto". United
States v. Platt, D.C.Tex., 31 F.Supp. 788, 793.
Statute which punishes as a crime an act previously com-
nlitted, which was innocent when done, which makes more
burdensome punishment for a crime after its commission,
or which deprives one charged with crime of any defense
available according to law at time act was committed, is
"ex post facto". People ex rel. Luciano v. Murphy, 290
N.Y.S. 1011, 1014, 160 Misc. 573.
The operation of a statute to repeal, extend the period
of, or provide for the tolling of a statute of limitations
under which a complete defense has already accrued, would
be "ex post facto". Hill v. State, 146 Tex.Cr.R. 333, 171
S.W.2d 880, 882, 883, 884.
The prohibition of "ex post facto" laws applies only to
criminal or penal matters. Bannister v. Bannister, 181 Md.
177, 29 A.2d 287, 289; Garrett Freight Lines v. State Tax
Commission, 103 Utah 390, 135 P.2d 523, 527, 146 A.L.R.
1003; Southern Kraft Corporation v. Hardin, 205 Ark. 512,
169 S.W.2d 637, 643.
To render a statute "ex post facto," it must be one which
imposes punishment for an act which was not punishable
when it was committed, or imposes additional punishment
-or alters the situation of the accused to his disadvantage.
Andrus v. McCauley, D.C.Wash., 21 F.Supp. 70.
Trial procedure may be changed by Legislature, and new
procedure may be made applicable to offenses previously
committed, without violation of constitutional provision.
People ex rel. Pincus v. Adams, 274 N.Y. 447, 9 N.E.2d 46,
49, 50, 110 A.L.R. 1303.
"Ex post facto" and "retrospective" are not convertible
terms. The latter is a term of wider signification than the
former and includes it. All ex post facto laws are neces-
sarily retrospective, but not e converso. A curative or con-
firmatory statute is retrospective, but not ex post facto.
Constitutions of nearly all the states contain prohibitions
against ex post facto laws, but only a few forbid retrospec-
tive legislation in specific terms. Black, Const.Prohib. §§
170, 172, 222.
Retrospective laws divesting vested rights are impolitic
and unjust; but they are not "ex post facto laws," within
the meaning of the constitution of the United States, nor
repugnant to any other of its provisions; and, if not
repugnant to the state constitution, a court cannot pro-
nounce them to be void, merely because in their judgment
they are contrary to the principles of natural justice.
Albee v. May, 2 Paine, 74 Fed.Cas.No.134.
Every retrospective act is not necessarily an ex post facto
law. That phrase embraces only such laws as impose or
affect penalties or forfeitures. Locke v. New Orleans, 4
Wall. 172, 18 L. Ed. 334.
Retrospective laws which do not impair the obligation of
contracts, or affect vested rights, or partake of the char-
acter of ex post facto laws, are not prohibited by the con-
stitution. Bay v. Gage, 36 Barb., N.Y., 447.
The act providing that every sentence of death imposed
shall be by electrocution is not an "ex post facto law"
because of its retrospective effect. State ex rel. Pierre v.
Jones, 200 La. 808, 9 So.2d 42, 45, 47.

the state, but on the information and at the instigation of
an individual who has a private interest in the matter, are
said to be taken "on the relation" (ex relatione) of such
person, who is called the "relator." Such a cause is
usually entitled thus : "State ex rel. Doe v. Roe."
In the books of reports, when a case is said to be

his account of it, not from personal knowledge, but from
the relation or narrative of some person who was present

communicated personally with the party upon the contents
of those letters or documents, or having otherwise acted
upon them by written answers, producing further corre-
spondence or acquiescence by the party in some matter to
which they relate, or by the witness transacting with the
party some business to which they relate, or by any other
mode of communication between the party and the witness
which, in the ordinary course of the transactions of life,
induces a reasonable presumption that the letters or docu-

## EXACTION

The wrongful act of an officer or
other person in compelling payment of a fee or
reward for his services, under color of his official

Between "extortion" and "exaction" there is this dif-
ference : that in the former case the officer extorts more
than his due, when something is due to him; in the latter,
he exacts what is not his due, when there is nothing due to
him. Co.Litt. 368.

## EXACTLY ALIKE

to bail for his trial by the proper court. U. S. W. Stanton,
C.C.A.Conn., 17 C.C.A. 475, 70 F. 890; State v. Conrad, 95
N.C. 669. The preliminary hearing to determine whether
person charged with having committed a crime should be
held for trial. Commonwealth v. Cohen, 102 Pa.Super. 397,

Trial Practice
The examination of a witness consists of the series of

sel, for the purpose of bringing before the court and jury
in legal form the knowledge which the witness has of the
facts and matters in dispute, or of probing and sifting his
evidence previously given.
Of a long account. This phrase does not mean
examination of the account to ascertain the result
or effect of it, but proof by testimony of correct-
ness of items composing it. Magown v. Sinclair,

the conduct of his business, the cause of his bank-
ruptcy, his dealings with his creditors and other
persons, the amount, kind, and whereabouts of
his property, and all matters which may affect
the administration and settlement of his estate.
This is authorized by Bankruptcy Act, § 7, 30 Stat.

liams, 184 Misc. 510, 55 N.Y.S.2d 181, 182.

## EXCEPT RIGHT OF WAY

Recitals "less the
right of way" and "except right of way" in grant-
ing clause of deed have well-defined accepted cer-
tain and unambiguous meaning by which grantor
conveys entire interest in servient estate and at
same time expressly recognizes and acknowledges
dominant estate. Jennings v. Amerada Petroleum
Corporation, 179 Okl. 561, 66 P.2d 1069, 1071.

## EXCEPTING

As used in a deed, the terms "re-
serving" and "excepting" are used interchange-
ably, and their technical meaning will give way
to the manifest intent. Porter v. Warner-Cald-
well Oil Co., 183 Okl. 1, 80 P.2d 252, 253.
The words "reserving" and "excepting," although
strictly distinguishable, may be used interchangeably or

ant admits the cause of action, but alleges new
facts which, provided they be true, totally or
partially answer the allegations put forward on
the other side; thus distinguished from a mere
traverse of the plaintiff's averments. Tomkins
& J. Mod. Rom. Law, 90. In this use, the term
corresponds to the common-law plea in confession
and avoidance.

the plaintiff's action. Calvin. A stop or stay to
an action opposed by the defendant. Cowell.

which forever destroyed the subject-matter or
ground of the action, (quce semper rem de qua

ment.

## EXCEPTIO REI VENDITIE ET TRADITZE

An

thing.
This exception presumes that there was a valid sale and
a proper tradition; but though, in consequence of the

than he himself has, no property was transferred, yet
because of some particular circumstance the real owner is
estopped from contesting it. Mackeld. Rom.Law, § 299.
EXCEPTIO SEMPER ULTIMO PONENDA EST.

cial bail put in by the defendant to an action at
law made by the plaintiff on grounds of the in-
sufficiency of the bail. 1 Tidd, Pr. 255.

to take special cases out of a general class or to guard
against misinterpretation. Landau v. Equitable Life Assur.
Soc. of United States, 1 N.Y.S.2d 891, 895, 166 Misc. 42.

during the trial of a cause, in refusing a request
or overruling an objection; implying that the par-
ty excepting does not acquiesce in the decision of
the court, but will seek to procure its reversal,

quest or objection in some future proceeding.
United States v. United States Fidelity & Guaran-
ty Co., 236 U.S. 512, 35 S.Ct. 298, 303, 59 L.Ed. 696;
Liquid Carbonic Co. v. Rodman, 52 Okl. 211, 152 P.
439; State v. Laundy, 103 Or. 443, 206 P. 290. It
is also somewhat used to signify other objections
in the course of a suit; for example, exception to
bail is a formal objection that special bail offered
by defendant is insufficient. 1 Tidd, Pr. 255.
An exception is, an objection formally taken to a deci-
sion of the court on a matter of law. State v. Wolzenski,
340 Mo. 1181, 105 S.W.2d 905, 907; an objection on a mat-
ter of law to a decision made, either before or after judg-
ment, by a court, tribunal, judge, or other judicial officer
in an action or proceeding. Hearn v. Gunther, 57 Cal.
App.2d 82, 134 P.2d 3, 5; an objection, oral or written,
taken, in course of an action or proceeding, as to bail, to
the decision or a ruling of a judge, or to something in his
charge to a jury. In re Pardue's Estate, 57 Cal.App.2d 918,
135 P.2d 394, 395.
.An objection to a pleading or any part thereof for want
of substance is a general exception; an objection to the
form in which a cause of action is stated is a special excep-
tion. Cochran v. People's Nat. Bank, Tex.Civ.App., 271
S.W. 433, 434.
Objections to report of master on bill for injunction held
"exceptions". Respro, Inc., v. Worcester Backing Co., 291
Mass. 467, 197 N.E. 198, 200.
To authorize review of alleged error in admitting evi-
dence in compensation case, there must be an "exception",
that known to equity practice, and defined as act of appeal-
ing from rulings appearing of record, and nothing more.
Indrisano's Case, 307 Mass. 520, 30 N.E.2d 538, 539.
Proviso and Exception Distinguished
A "proviso" and an "exception" are substantial-
ly the same thing. Evans v. McCabe, 164 Tenn.
672, 52 S.W.2d 159, 160.
A proviso differs from an exception. 1 Barn. &
Ald. 99. An exception exempts, absolutely, from
the operation of an engagement or an enactment;
a proviso, properly speaking, defeats their opera-
tion, conditionally. An exception takes out of an
engagement or enactment something which would
otherwise be part of the subject-matter of it; a
proviso avoids them by way of defeasance or ex-
cuse. 8 Am.Jur. 242; Board of Com'rs of Noble
County v. Whitney, 73 Okl. 160, 175 P. 112, 113;
Philadelphia Life Ins. Co. v. Farnsley's Adm'r,
162 Ky. 27, 171 S.W. 1004, 1005; New Jersey State
Board of Optometrists v. S. S. Kresge Co., Sup.,
113 N.J.L. 287, 174 A. 353, 357; Sowers Plan Crop
Ins. Mut. Co. v. Hobbs, 146 Kan. 166, 68 P.2d 1110,
The ordinary office of an "exception" or "proviso" in a
policy is to take special cases out of a general class or to
guard against misinterpretation. Landau v. Equitable Life
Assur. Soc. of United States, 1 N.Y.S.2d 891, 895, 166
Misc. 42.
Reservation and Exception as Synonymous or
Distinguishable
A reservation is always of a thing not in esse, but newly
created or reserved out of the land or tenement demised;
• an exception is always of a part of the thing granted, and
of a thing in esse. Co.Litt. 47a; 4 Kent, Comm. 468.
A "reservation" creates some new right in grantor while
an "exception" withholds from grant title to some part of
property which would otherwise pass. Clark v. Pauley,
291 Ky. 637, 165 S.W.2d 161, 162; Federal Land Bank of
New Orleans v. Cooper, 190 Miss. 490, 200 So. 729, 730, 731;
Goss v. Congdon, 114 Vt. 155, 40 A.2d 429, 430.
A reservation does not affect the description of the prop-
erty conveyed, but retains to the grantor some right upon
the property, as an easement, whereas an exception oper-
ates upon the description and withdraws from the descrip-
tion the excepted property. Moore v. Davis, 273 Ky. 838,
117 S.W.2d 1033, 1035.
A "reservation" is always of something taken back out of
that which is clearly granted, while an "exception" is of
some part of the estate not granted at all. Houghtaling
v. Stoothoff, 170 Misc. 773, 12 N.Y.S.2d 207, 210; Lewis v.
Standard Oil Co. of California, C.C.A.Cal., 88 F.2d 512, 514.
A reservation provides for return of rent or service, re-
garded as issuing out of land granted. An exception with-
holds particular portion of land granted. Cook v. Farley,
195 Miss. 638, 15 So.2d 352, 355 ; Marias River Syndicate v.
Big West Oil Co., 98 Mont. 254, 38 P.2d 599, 601.
Reservation means something issuing or arising out of
thing granted while an exception means some part of the
estate not granted, or withdrawn from the effect of the
grant, although the terms are often used indiscriminately
and given effect according to the obvious intent of the
parties. Vance v. Pritchard, 213 N.C. 552, 197 S.E. 182,
Reservation must always be in favor of and for benefit of
grantor, whereas exception is mere exclusion from grant,
of some interest which may be vested in grantor or out-
standing in another; reservation reserves to grantor some
new thing, either issuing out of or incident to thing grant-
ed, while exception in deed is clause exempting from oper-
ation thereof and retaining in grantor title to some part of
the thing granted or excepting some part of thing granted,
title to which is at the time in another. Klein v. Humble
Oil & Refining Co., Tex.Civ.App., 67 S.W.2d 911, 915.
Reservation reserves to grantor some new interest out of
thing granted, while exception excludes from operation of
grant some existing part of estate. Petty v. Griffith, Mo.,
165 S.W.2d 412, 414; U. S. v. 1,010.8 Acres, More or Less,
Situate in Sussex County, Del., D.C.Del., 56 F.Supp. 120,
The terms "reservation" and "exception" are frequently
used as interchangeable for synonymous terms. Nelson v.
Bacon, 113 Vt. 161, 32 A.2d 140, 145; Murphy v. Sunset
Hills Ass'n, 243 Wis. 139, 9 N.W.2d 613, 615; Meaning in-
tended must be determined by reference to subject matter
and surrounding circumstances. Federal Land Bank of
New Orleans v. Cooper, 190 Miss. 490, 200 So. 729, 730, 731;
Duus v. Town of Ephrata, 14 Wash.2d 426, 128 P.2d 510,
511; Parties' intention, not language used, is dominating
factor in determining whether provision is reservation or
exception. Goss v. Congdon, 114 Vt. 155, 40 A.2d 429, 430;
Technical meaning will yield to the manifest intent. Jen-
sen v. Sheker, 231 Iowa 240, 1 NtW.2d 262, 267; Technical
misnomer does not operate to defeat attempted reserva-
tion or exception. Clark v. Pauley, 291 Ky. 637, 165 S. W.
2d 161, 162; It has been also said that there is a diversity
between an exception and a saving, for an exception ex-
empts clearly, but a saving goes to the matters touched,
and does not exempt. Plowd. 361. Ogden v. Straus Bldg.
Corporation, 187 Wis. 232, 202 N.W. 34, 44; Haymaker v.
Windsor Reservoir & Canal Co., 81 Colo. 168, 254 P. 768,
770; Central Bank & Trust Co. v. Wyatt, 189 N.C. 107, 126
S.E. 93, 94; Greenspan v. Yaple, 194 N.Y.S. 658, 659, 201
App. Div. 575.
Statutory Law
An exception in a statute is a clause designed
to reserve or exempt some individuals from the
general class of persons or things to which the
language of the act in general attaches. People
v. Bailey, 103 Misc. 366, 171 N.Y.S. 394, 397.
An exception differs from an explanation, which, by the
use of a videlicet, proviso, etc., is allowed only to explain
generals into particulars. Cutler v. Tufts, 3 Pick., Mass.,
An "exception" exempts absolutely from the operation of
the statute, while a "proviso" generally defeats operation
of statute conditionally. Oregon Liquor Control Com-
mission v. Coe, 163 Or. 646, 99 P.2d 29, 31; People v.
Thursam, City Ct., 23 N.Y.S.2d 706, 710, 713.
The office of an "exception" in a statute is to except
something from the operative effect of a statute or to
qualify or restrain the generality of the substantive en-
actment to which it is attached, and it is not necessarily
limited to the section of the statute immediately following
or preceding. Gatliff Coal Co. v. Cox, C.C.A.Ky., 142 F.2d
876, 882.
Two statutes relating to same subject must be read to-
gether, and provisions of one having special application to
particular subject will be deemed an "exception" to other
statute general in its terms. Eagleton v. Murphy, 348 Mo.
949, 156 S.W.2d 683, 685, 138 A.L.R. 749.
Zoning
An "exception" in zoning ordinance is one al-
lowable where conditions detailed therein as those
on which exception may be permitted exist. Ap-
plication of Devereux Foundation, 351 Pa. 478, 41
A.2d 744, 746.
Exceptions may be treated as a legislative process, con-
ditions for which must be found in the zoning ordinance
and may not be varied, and variances may be treated as
judicial function through appeals from administrative or-
ders, whereby literal enforcement of ordinance may be
disregarded. Stone v. Cray, 89 N.H. 483, 200 A. 517, 521.

## EXCEPTION EN MASSE

An assignment in de-
fendant's amended motion for new trial that
"court erred in giving Instructions Nos. 1 to 10,
inclusive", is "exception en masse". Tugg v. State,
206 Ark. 161, 174 S.W.2d 374, 376.

## EXCEPTION OF LACK OF CAPACITY TO STAND IN JUDGMENT

Challenges authority of
plaintiff to institute and prosecute suit regardless
of whether plaintiff owns or has an interest in
the claim. It is usually resorted to where plain-
tiff is alleged to be under some disability or where
he sues through a representative who, it is alleged,
has no authority. Riche v. Ascension Parish
School Board, La.App., 200 So. 681, 685.
EXCEPTION OF MISJOINDER seeks to restrain
plaintiff's pursuit of the cause when there is pres-
ent another party whose liabilities or rights are
not connected with the exceptor. Henrichs v. New
Orleans Public Service, La.App., 179 So. 610.
EXCEPTION OF NO CAUSE OF ACTION ad-
dresses itself to sufficiency in law of the petition
and exhibits attached. Bartholomew v. Impastato,
La.App., 12 So.2d 700, 702.
EXCEPTION OF NO RIGHT OF ACTION chal-
lenges plaintiff's interest or right to assert cause
of action. McCain v. Le Blanc Bros., La.App., 10
So.2d 116, 118.
EXCEPTION OF WANT OF INTEREST or of "no
right of action" is afforded as means of challeng-
ing preliminarily either interest or right of plain-
tiff to assert cause of action and is not limited to
want of capacity in plaintiff as such to bring suit.

sary. Wharton.

re Losasso, 15 Colo. 163, 24 P. 1080, 10 L.R.A. 847;
Ex parte Ryan, 44 Cal. 558.
The denial of bail is not necessarily "excessive bail",
although such denial may be in a particular case the equiv-
alent of excessive bail. People ex rel. Shapiro v. Keeper 'of
City Prison, Tombs, New York County, 265 App.Div. 474,
39 N :Y.S.2d 526, 531.

Exchange is a contract by which the parties
mutually give, or agree to give, one thing for an-
other, neither thing, or both things, being money

The distinction between a sale and exchange of property
is rather one of shadow than of substance. In both cases
the title to property is absolutely transferred; and the
same rules of law are applicable to the transaction, wheth-
er the consideration of the contract is money or by way of
barter. It can make no essential difference in the rights
and obligations of parties that goods and merchandise are
transferred and paid for by other goods and merchandise
instead of by money, which is but the representative of
value or property. Com. v. Clark, 14 Gray, Mass., 367.

property is property tax. City of De Land v. Flori-
da Public Service Co., 119 Fla. 804, 161 So. 735,

owns for needs of government, and is not an "excise tax"

year. Bemis Hardwood Lumber Co. v. Graham County, N.
C., 214 N.C. 167, 198 S.E. 843, 845.

Public Service Co. v. James, Tex.Civ.App., 167 S.W.2d 588,
Income tax is a "property tax" and not an "excise tax."
Jensen v. Henneford, 185 Wash. 209, 53 P.2d 607, 610.
The words "tax" and "excise," although often used as
synonymous, are to be considered as having entirely dist
tinct and separate significations, under Const.Mass. c. 1, §
1, art. 4. The former is a charge apportioned either among
the whole people of the state or those residing within cer-
tain districts, municipalities, or sections. It is required to
be imposed, so that, if levied for the public charges of
government, it shall be shared according to the estate, real
and personal, which each person may possess; or, if raised
to defray the cost of some local improvement of a public
nature, it shall be borne by those who will receive some
special and peculiar benefit or advantage which an ex-
penditure of money for a public object may cause to those
on whom the tax is assessed. An excise, on the other hand,
is of a different character. It is based on no rule of au-
portionment or equality whatever. It is a fixed, absolute,
and direct charge laid on merchandise, products, or com-
modities, without any regard to the amount of property
belonging to those on whom it may fall, or to any sup-
posed relation between money expended for a public object
and a special benefit occasioned to those by whom the
charge is to be paid. Oliver v. Washington Mills, 11 Allen,
Mass., 268.

## EXCISE LAW

A law imposing excise duties on
specified commodities, and providing for the col-
lection of revenue therefrom. In a more restrict-
ed and more popular sense, a law regulating,
restricting, or taxing the manufacture or sale of
intoxicating liquors.
A statute requiring payment of license fee for operating
motor vehicle on state highway for hire is an "excise tax
measure" rather than a "police measure." Comp. Laws
Nev. § 4437. Ziemer v. Babcock & Wilcox Co., D.C.Nev.,
22 F.Supp. 384, 385.

The words "exclusive jurisdiction" when used in statutes
with respect to inferior criminal courts were only intended

## EXCLUSIVE RIGHT

An exclusive right is one
which only the grantee thereof can exercise, and
from which all others are prohibited or shut out.
By "exclusive right" essential to a right of way by pre-
scription, the law means that the right should not depend
for its enjoyment upon a similar right in others; it must
be exclusive as against the right of the community at
large. Downie v. City of Renton, 162 Wash. 181, 298 P.
454, 457.
The word "exclusive," as used in deed granting exclusive
right to erect and maintain poles with wires meant that

erty used "exclusively for any public purpose"

## EXCOMMENGEMENT

Excommunication ( q.
v.). Co. Litt. 134a.

## EXCOMMUNICATION

A sentence of censure
pronounced by one of the spiritual courts for of-
fenses falling under ecclesiastical cognizance.
It is described in the books as two-fold : (1) The lesser
excommunication, which is an ecclesiastical censure, ex-
cluding the party from the sacraments; (2) the greater,
which excludes him from the company of all Christians.
Formerly, too, an excommunicated man was under various
civil disabilities. He could not serve upon juries, or be a
witness in any court; neither could he bring an action to
recover lands or money due to him. These penalties are
abolished by St. 53 Geo. III. c. 127. 3 Steph.Comm. 721.

## EXCOMMUNICATO CAPIENDO

cated person, so that he cannot act, nor sue any
person, but he may be sued by others.

## EXCOMMUNICATO RECAPIENDO

A writ com-
manding that persons excommunicated, who for
their obstinacy had been committed to prison, but
were unlawfully set free before they had given
caution to obey the authority of the church, should
be sought after, retaken, and imprisoned again.
Reg. Orig. 67.
EXCULPATE is employed in sense of excuse of
justification. State v. Langdon, 46 N.M. 277, 127
P.2d 875, 876.

## EXCULPATION

In Scotland the law allows of
an "exculpation", by which the prisoner is suffered
before his trial to prove the thing to be impos-
sible. State v. Langdon, 46 N.M. 277, 127 P.2d 875,

## EXCUSABLE

Admitting of excuse or palliation.
As used in the law, this word implies that the act or
omission spoken of is on its face unlawful, wrong, or liable
to entail loss or disadvantage on the person chargeable, but
that the circumstances attending it were such as to con-
stitute a legal "excuse" for it, that is, a legal •reason for
withholding or foregoing the punishment, liability, or
disadvantage which otherwise would follow.

## EXCUSABLE ASSAULT

One committed by ac-
cident or misfortune in doing any lawful act by
lawful means, with ordinary caution and without
any unlawful intent. People v. O'Connor, 82 App.
Div. 55, 81 N.Y.S. 555.

## EXCUSABLE HOMICIDE

See Homicide.

## EXCUSABLE NEGLECT

In practice, and parti-
cularly with reference to the setting aside of a
judgment taken against a party through his "ex-
cusable neglect," this means a failure to take the
proper steps at the proper time, not in conse-
quence of the party's own carelessness, inatten-
tion, or willful disregard of the process of the
court, but in consequence of some unexpected or
unavoidable hindrance or accident, or reliance on
the care and vigilance of his counsel or on promis-
es made by the adverse party. See 1 Bl. Judgm.

estate, on the other hand, is at the same moment an-
nihilated. 1 Steph.Comm. 339.

the attachment is really a preliminary execution depend-

ment in plaintiff's favor; on the other hand, an "execu-
tion" is a remedy afforded by 4.w for the enforcement of
a judgment of the court. J. M. Radford Grocery Co. v.

Sometimes from the neglect of parties, or some other
cause, it became impossible to carry a decree into execu-
tion without the further decree of the court upon a bill
filed for that purpose. This happened generally in cases
where, parties having neglected to proceed upon the decree,
their rights under it became so embarrassed by a variety
of subsequent events that it was necessary to have the de-
cree of the court to settle and ascertain them. Such a bill
might also be brought to carry into execution the judg-
ment of an inferior court of equity, if the jurisdiction of
that court was not equal to the purpose; as in the case of
a decree in Wales, which the defendant avoided by flee-
ing into England. This species of bill was generally part-

original bill, though not strictly original. Story, Eq. P1

Cal.App.2d 138, 113 P.2d 759, 760.

## EXPECTANCY

That which is expected or hoped
for. The condition of being deferred to a future
time, or of dependence upon an expected event;
contingency as to possession or enjoyment. With
respect to the time of their enjoyment, estates
may either be in possession or in expectancy; and
of expectancies there are two sorts,—one created
by the act of the parties, called a "remainder;"
the other by act of law, called a "reversion." 2
Bl.Comm. 163.
" 'Expectancy' as applied to property, is contingency as
to possession, that which is expected or hoped for. At
most it is a mere hope or expectation, contingent upon the
will and pleasure of the landowner, and hardly reaches the
height of a property right, much less a vested right, be-
cause where there is no obligation, there is no right. It
is a possibility for which a party may under certain cir-
cumstances properly hope." Robinson v. Eagle-Picher
Lead Co., 132 Kan. 860, 297 P. 697, 698, 75 A.L.R. 840.

EXPECTANT ESTATES, See Estate in Expect-
ancy.

## EXPECTANT HEIR

A person who has the ex-
pectation of inheriting property or an estate, but
small present means.
The term is chiefly used in equity, where relief is afford-
ed to such persons against the enforcement of "catching
bargains," (q. v.) Jeffers v. Lampson, 10 Ohio St. 106;
In re Robbins' Estate, 199 Pa. 500, 49 A.. 233. "The phrase
is used not in its literal meaning, but as including every
one who has either a vested remainder, or a contingent
remainder in a family property, including a remainder in
a portion, as well as a remainder in an estate, and every
one who has the hope of succession to the property of an
ancestor, either by reason of his being the heir-apparent
or presumptive, or by reason, merely, o the expectation of
a devise or bequest on account of the supposed or presumed
affection of his ancestor or relation. More than this, the
doctrine as to expectant heirs has been extended to all
reversioners and remaindermen. So that the doctrine not
only included the class mentioned, who in some popular
sense might be called 'expectant heirs,' but also all re-
maindermen and reversioners." Jessel, M. R.

## EXPECTANT RIGHT

A contingent right, not
vested; one which depends on the continued exis-
tence of the present condition of things until the

Rep. 735; Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. Empire Coal Mining
Co., C.C.A.Colo., 30 F.2d 794, 798. In the common accept-
ance of the term, it includes the sudden bursting or break-
ing up from an internal or other force, and is not limited to
cases caused by combustion or fire. American Paper Prod-
ucts Co. v. Continental Ins. Co., 208 Mo.App. 87, 225 S.W.
1029, 1030. The ordinary idea is that the explosion is the

A violent bursting or expansion with noise following the

The word "explosion" is variously used in ordinary
speech, and is not one that admits of exact definition.
Every combustion of an explosive substance, whereby other
property is ignited and consumed, would not be an "explo-
sion," within the ordinary meaning of the term. It is not
used
described generally as a sudden and rapid combus-
tion, causing violent expansion of the air, and accompanied
by a report. But the rapidity of the combustion, the vio-
lence of the expansion, and the vehemence of the report
vary in intensity as often as the occurrences multiply.
Hence an explosion i ts an idea of degrees; and the true
meaning of the word, in each particular case, must be set-
tled, not by any fixed standard or accurate measurement,
but by the common experience and notions of men in mat-
ters of that sort. Insurance Co. v. Foote, 22 Ohio St. 348,
10 Am.Rep. 735. And see Insurance Co. v. Dorsey, 56 Md.
81, 40 Am.Rep. 403; Louisville Underwriters v. Durland,
123 Ind. 544, 24 N.E. 221, 7 L.R.A. 399.

EXPORT, v. To carry or to send abroad. Tennes-

In as well as the shipment to a foreign country, it is often
used as meaning only the shipment from this country.

another. Co.Litt. 210a; Burgin v. Forbes, 293
Ky. 456, 169 S.W.2d 321, 325; Newblock v. Bowles,
170 Oki. 487, 40 P.2d 1097, 1100. Mention of one

Saslaw v. Weiss, 133 Ohio St. 496, 14 N.E.2d 930,
932. When certain persons or things are specified,
in a law, contract, or will, an intention to ex-
clude all others from its operation may be in-
ferred. Little v. Town of Conway, 171 S.C. 27,
170 S.E. 447, 448.
Under this maxim, if statute specifies one exception to
a general rule or assumes to specify the effects of a certain
provision, other exceptions or effects are excluded, People

That which is expressed makes that which is im-
plied to cease, [that is, supersedes it, or controls
its effect.] Thus, an implied covenant in a deed is
in all cases controlled by an express covenant. 4
Coke, 80; Broom, Max. 651; 5 Bingh.N.C. 185; 6
B. & C. 609; 2 C. & M. 459; 2 E. & B. 856; And-

EXPROMISSIO. In the, civil law. The species
of novation by which a creditor , accepts a new
debtor, who becomes bound instead of the old, the
latter being released. 1 Bouv.Inst. no. 802.

## EXPROMISSOR

In the civil law. A person who
assumes the debt of another, and becomes solely
liable for it, by a stipulation with the creditor.
He differs from a surety, inasmuch as this con-
tract is one of novation, while a surety is jointly
liable with his principal. Mackeld.Rom.Law, §
538; Dig. 12, 4, 4; 16, 1, 13; 24, 3, 64, 4; 38, 1, 37,
EXPROMITTERE. In the civil law. To under-

## EXPROPRIATION

This word primarily denotes
a voluntary surrender of rights or claims; the act
of divesting oneself of that which was previously
claimed as one's own, or renouncing it. In this
sense it is the opposite of "appropriation."
A meaning has been attached to the term, imported from
its use in foreign jurisprudence, which makes it synony-
mous with the exercise of the power of eminent domain,
i. e., the compulsory taking from a person, on compensa-
tion made, of his private property for the use of a railroad,
canal, or other public work. Brownsville v. Pavazos, 2
Woods 293, Fed.Cas.No.2,043. In Louisiana expropriation
is used as is taking under eminent domain in most of the
other states. In England "compulsory purchase" Is used;
Halsbury, Laws of England.
French Law
Expropriation is the compulsory realization of a
debt by the creditor out of the lands of his debtor,
or the usufruct thereof. When the debtor is coten-
ant with others, it is necessary that a partition
should first be made. It is confined, in the first
place, to the lands (if any) that are in hypothêque,
but afterwards extends to the lands not in hypo-
thêque. Moreover, the debt must be of a liqui-
dated amount. Brown.

of a corporation, legislative body, assembly, so-
ciety, commercial organization, etc., of his mem-
bership in the same, by a legal vote of the body

Dec. 604. Also, in the law of torts and of land-
lord and tenant, an eviction or forcible putting
out. See Expel.
"Separation" from a church by reason of a schism is
not like "expulsion" or "excommunication," which terms
necessarily involve involuntary and compulsory separation
of members. Lindstrom v. Tell, 131 Minn. 203, 154 N.W.
969, 971.

inal limit; as, to extend the time for filing an answer, to

Smith, 168 Tenn. 203, 76 S.W.2d 644; Loeffier v. Federal
Supply Co., 187 Okl. 373, 102 P.2d 862, 864.
Statute authorizing Interstate Commerce Commission to
require carriers to "extend" lines is confined to extensions
within undertaking of carriers to serve, and does not
embrace new lines reaching new territory. Interstate Com-
merce Commission v. Oregon-Washington R. & Nay. Co.,
Or., 288 U.S. 14, 53 S.Ct. 266, 77 L.Ed. 588.

greater or longer time to operate in than that to which it
was originally limited. Fidelity & Columbia Trust Co. v.
Louisville Ry. Co., 258 Ky. 817, 81 S.W.2d 896, 900.
To "extend" a lease or contract is not necessarily the
same as "renew," for a stipulation to renew requires the
making of a new lease, while one to extend does not.
Sanders v. Wender, 205 Ky. 422, 265 S.W. 939, 941. See,
also, Nenzel v. Rochester Silver Corporation, 48 Nev. 41,
226 P. 1102, 1105; Livingston Waterworks v. City of Liv-
ingston, 53 Mont. 1, 162 P. 381, 383, L.R.A.1917D, 1074;
Buckland v. Tarble, 95 Vt. 87, 112 A. 217, 218. But whether
a clause in a lease is a covenant of renewal or an agree-
ment for an extension depends on the parties' intention
and the use of the word "renewal"; Freiheit v. Broch, 98
Conn. 166, 118 A. 828, 829; and the two terms may be used
practically synonymously; American Press v. City of St.
Louis, 314 Mo. 288, 284 S.W. 482, 486; Orr v. Doubleday,
Page & Co., 157 N.Y.S. 1009, 1012, 172 App.Div. 96. The
word "extend" as used in a lease does not necessarily
mean the same, as "renew," but context may show intent
that the words be given a similar meaning. Candler v.
Smyth, 168 Ga. 276, 147 S.E. 552, 554.
To extend a street means to prolong and continue it in
the direction in which it already points, but does not

Tidd, Pr. 1043, 1044.
Taxation
Extending a tax consists in adding to the as-
sessment roll the precise amount due from each
person whose name appears thereon. "The sub-
jects for taxation having been properly listed,
and a basis for apportionment established, noth-
ing will remain to fix a definite liability but to
extend upon the list or roll the several propor-
tionate amounts, as a charge against the several
taxables." Cooley, Tax'n, 2d Ed., 423.

State Board of Land Com'rs of Montana, 100
Mont. 109, 47 P.2d 47, 49.

provisions of statute by reference to its title only, has ref-
erence to an attempt to add something to text of pre-exist-
ing law. Hollis & Co. v. McCarroll, 200 Ark. 523, 140

92 A.L.R. 693.

## EXTENDED LEASE

An "extended lease" is
merely enlarged upon all the terms and condi-
tions of the instrument, while a "renewed lease"
is a new lease. Rathbone v. State Board of Land
Com'rs of Montana, 100 Mont. 109, 47 P.2d 47, 49.

erence to options for renewal or for extension, are synony-
mous. Economy Stores v. Moran, 178 Miss. 62, 172 So. 865,
The distinction between "extension" and "renewal" of
lease is chiefly that, in the case of renewal, a new lease is
requisite, while, in the case of extension, the same lease

## EXTINGUISHMENT

The destruction or cancel-
lation of a right, power, contract, or estate. The
annihilation of a collateral thing or subject in the
subject itself out of which it is derived. Prest.
Merg. 9. For the distinction between an extin-
guishment and passing a right, see 2 Shars.Bl.
Comm. 325, note.
"Extinguishment" is sometimes confounded with "merg-
er," though there is a clear distinction between them.
"Merger" is only a mode of extinguishment, and applies to
estates only under particular circumstances ; but "extin-
guishment" is a term of general application to rights, as
well as estates. 2 Crabb, Real Prop. p. 367, § 1487. "Extin-
guishment" connotes the end of a thing, precluding the
existence of future life therein ; in "mergers" there is a
carrying on of the substance of the thing, except that it is
merged into and becomes a part of a separate thing with a
new identity. McRoberts v. McRoberts, 177 Okl. 156, 57
P.2d 1175, 1177.

## EXTINGUISHMENT OF COMMON

right to have common. This may happen from

## EXTINGUISHMENT OF COPYHOLD

In English
law. A copyhold is said to be extinguished when
the freehold and copyhold interests unite in the
same person and in the same right, which may be
either by the copyhold interest coming to the free-
hold or by the freehold interest coming to the
copyhold. 1 Crabb, Real Prop. p. 670, § 864; Hutt.
81; Cro.Eliz. 21; Wms.R.P. 287.

## EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBTS

This takes
place by payment; by accord and satisfaction;
by novation, or the substitution of a new debtor;
by merger, when the creditor recovers a judg-
ment or accepts a security of a higher nature than
the original obligation; by a release; by the mar-
riage of a feme sole creditor with the debtor, or
of an obligee with one of two joint obligors; and
where one of the parties, debtor or creditor, makes
the other his executor.

## EXTINGUISHMENT OF LEGACY

This occurs
in case the identical thing bequeathed is not in
existence, or has been disposed of so that it does
not form part of the testator's estate, at the time

So. 197, 198. See Ademption.

## EXTINGUISHMENT OF LIEN

may also be extinguished by conjunction of es-
tates, by confirmation, by grant, by release, and by
surrender. 1 Crabb, Real Prop. pp. 210-213, § 209.

effected by unity of possession. As if a man have
a way over the close of another, and he purchase
that close, the way is extinguished. 1 Crabb, Real
Prop. p. 341,. § 384; 2 Washb.Real Prop.

## EXTIRPATION

## EXTOCARE

In old records. To grub woodland,
and reduce it to arable or meadow; "to stock up."

## EXTORSIVELY

A technical word used in in-
dictments for extortion.
It is a sufficient averment of a corrupt intent, in an
indictment for extortion, to allege that the defendant
"extorsively" took the unlawful fee. Leeman v. State, 35
Ark. 438, 37 Am.Rep. 44. When a person is charged with
extorsively taking, the very import of the word shows that
he is not acquiring possession of his own, 4 Cox, Cr.Cas.
387. In North Carolina the crime may be charged without
using this word, State v. Dickens, 2 N.C. 406.

thing wrongfully by threats or putting in fear.

To wrest from, to exact, to take under a claim
of protection. Commonwealth v. Neubauer, 142
Pa.Super. 528, 16 A.2d 450, 452.
The natural meaning of the word "extort" is to obtain
money or other valuable thing either by compulsion, by
actual force, or by the force of motives applied to the will,
and often more overpowering and irresistible than physical
force. Com. v. O'Brien, 12 Cush., Mass., 90.

ORE OFFICH EXTORQUET QUOD NON EST
DEBITUM, VEL SUPRA DEBITUIVI, VEL ANTE

him and to destroy his property, State v. Phillips, 62 Idaho

A taking under color of office is of essence of offense. La
Tour v. Stone, 139 Fla. 681, 190 So. 704, 709, 710.
At common law, any oppression by color or pretense of
right, and particularly and technically the exaction or
unlawful taking by an officer of money or thing of value,

be the operating cause producing consent. People v. Biggs,
178 Cal. 79, 172 P. 152, 153.
The distinction between "bribery" and "extortion" seems
to be this: the former offense consists in the offering a
present, or receiving one, if offered; the latter, in demand-
ing a fee or present, by color of office. Jacob.
For the distinction between "extortion" and

,
destructiveness could not have been anticipated

## EXTRAORDINARY RISK

The expression is
generally used to describe risks arising from the
negligence of the master. Tenney v. Baird Ma-
chine Co., 87 Conn. 119, 87 A. 352, 354; Royal Col-
lieries Co. v. Wells, 210 Ky. 600, 276 S.W. 515, 518.
An "extraordinary risk" is one lying outside of
the sphere of the normal, arising out of condi-
tions not usual in the master's business. Brazeale
v. Piedmont Mfg. Co., 184 S.C. 471, 193 S.E. 39,
43. It is one which is not normally and neces-
sarily incident to the employment. Pollard v.
Weeks, 60 Ga.App. 664, 4 S.E.2d 722, 727. It is
one which is not naturally incident to occupation
and grows employer furnish
safe place to work and proper and safe appliances
and tools for work. Snow v. Texas & P. Ry. Co.,
La.App., 166 So. 200, 203. It is one which may be
obviated by the exercise of reasonable care by
the employer. Wheeler v. Chicago & W. I. R. Co.,
267 Ill. 306, 108 N.E. 330, 336; Louisiana Ry. &
Nay. Co. of Texas v. Disheroon, Tex.Civ.App., 295
S.W. 250, 252. It is a risk which is only indirectly
connected with the employment. Emerick v. Sla-
ronian Roman Greek Catholic Union, 93 N.J.L.
282, 108 A. 223.
As respects assumption of risks, an "extraordinary risk"
is not one which is uncommon or unusual in the sense that
it is rare, but is one which arises out of unusual conditions
not resulting in the ordinary course of business, as by rea-
son of the master's negligence, Leyba v. Albuquerque &
Cerrillos Coal Co., 22 N.M. 455, 164 P. 823, 825; Houston
Lighting & Power Co., 1905 v. Conley, Tex.Civ.App., 171
S.W. 561, 563; it is a risk arising from the master's negli-
gence, Simowitz v. Register, 60 Ga.App. 180, 3 S.E.2d 231,
233; it is a risk which may be obviated by exercise of rea-
sonable care on master's part. Tyner v. Atlantic Coast
Line R. Co., 149 S.C. 89, 146 S.E. 663, 670. A servant does
not assume "extraordinary risks" unless they are known
to and appreciated by him, or are so obvious that ordi-
narily prudent person under circumstances would have
observed and appreciated them, Brazeale v. Piedmont Mfg.
Co., 184 S.C. 471, 193 S.E. 39, 43; unless they are known
or obvious. Pollard v. Weeks, 60 Ga.App. 664, 4 S.E.2d 722,
727. If injury results from master's breach of duty of due
care the risk is "extraordinary" and is assumed only if
servant knew or ought to have known of dangerous condi-
tion and comprehended it or must be taken to have known
of and comprehended it. Stone v. Howe, 92 N.H. 425, 32
A.2d 484, 486.
Under Federal Employers' Liability Act, "extraordinary
risks" are risks not normally and necessarily incident to
employment, Southern Ry. Co. v. Blanton, 63 Ga.App. 93,
10 S.E.2d 430, 434; an employee is not treated as assuming
extraordinary risks arising from defects due to negligence.
of employer unless he has knowledge of them or danger is
so obvious that it would be appreciated by ordinarily pru-
dent person, Snow v. Texas & P. Ry. Co., La.App., 166 So.
200, 203.

## EXTRAORDINARY SERVICES

As applied to
the care and attention of an old and infirm person,
such services as are unusual, extra, or above those
generally required or to be anticipated in usual
course of things, not such services as are rendered
to an old and feeble person, even though sick,
which are not different from those usually requir-
ed by such persons in similar circumstances. Al-
len v. Smith, 208 Ky. 207, 270 S.W. 782, 783.
As used in statute authorizing allowance of additional
compensation to guardian, means services in addition to
guardian's usual or regular services. In re Gislason's
Estate, 73 N.D. 731, 19 N.W.2d 447, 451, 452.
EXTRAORDINARY STORM is not necessarily
an unprecedented one, but one that happens so
rarely that it is unusual and not ordinarily to be
expected. Spitzer v. City of Waterbury, 113 Conn.
84, 154 A. 157, 160; Oklahoma City v. Evans, 173
Okl. 586, 50 P.2d 234, 238.

tion of the laws of a state granted to foreign dip-
lomatic agents, warships, etc. Wheaton, § 224.
The term is used to indicate jurisdiction exercised
by a nation in other countries, by treaty, as, by
the United States in China or Egypt; or by its
own ministers or consuls in foreign lands. Crime
is said to be extraterritorial when committed in
a country other than that of the forum in which
the party is tried. See 2 Moore, Int.L.Dig.; U. S.
v. Lucas, D.C.Wash., 6 F.2d 327, 328.

## EXTRAVAGANTES

In canon law. Those de-
cretal epistles which were published after the
Clementines.
They were so called because at first they were not
digested or arranged with the other papal constitutions,
but seemed to be, as it were, detached from the canon law.
They continued to be called by the same name when they
were afterwards inserted in the body of the canon law.
The first extravagantes are those of Pope John XXII., suc-
cessor of Clement V. The last collection was brought down
to the year 1483, and was called the "Common Extrava-
gantes," notwithstanding that they were likewise incor-
porated with the rest of the canon law. Enc.Lond.
