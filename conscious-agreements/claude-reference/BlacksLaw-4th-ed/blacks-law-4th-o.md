## OATH

Any form of attestation by which a per-
son signifies that he is bound in conscience to per-
form an act faithfully and truthfully. Vaughn v.
State, 146 Tex.Cr.R. 586, 177 S.W.2d 59, 60. An
affirmation of truth of a statement, which renders
one willfully asserting untrue statements punish-
able for perjury. U. S. v. Klink, D.C.Wyo., 3 F.
Supp. 208, 210. An outward pledge by the person
taking it that his attestation or promise is made
under an immediate sense of responsibility to
God. Morrow v. State, 140 Neb. 592, 300 N.W.
843, 845. A solemn appeal to the Supreme Being
in attestation of the truth of some statement.
State v. Jones, 28 Idaho 428, 154 P. 378, 381; Ty-
ler, Oaths 15. An external pledge or assevera-
tion, made in verification of statements made, or
to be made, coupled with an appeal to a sacred or
venerated object, in evidence of the serious and
reverent state of mind of the party, or with an in-
vocation to a supreme being to witness the words
of the party, and to visit him with punishment if
they be false. June v. School Dist. No. 11, South-
field Tp., 283 Mich. 533, 278 N.W. 676, 677, 116 A.L.
R. 581. In its broadest sense, the term is used to
include all forms of attestation by which a party
signifies that he is bound in conscience to perform
the act faithfully and truly. In a more restricted
sense, it excludes all those forms of attestation or
promise which are not accompanied by an im-
precation.
The term has been variously defined: as, "a solemn
invocation of the vengeance of the Deity upon the witness
if he do not declare the whole truth, so far as he knows
it," 1 Stark.Ev. 22; or, "a religious asseveration by which
a person renounces the mercy and Imprecates the venge-
ance of Heaven if he do not speak the truth," 1 Leach 430:
or, as "a religious act by which the party invokes God not
only to witness the truth and sincerity of his promise, but
also to avenge his imposture or violated faith, or, in other
words, to punish his perjury if he shall be guilty of it,"
10 Toullier, n. 343; Puffendorff, b. 4, c. 2, § 4. The essen-
tial idea of an oath would seem to be, however, that of a
recognition of God's authority by the party taking it, and
an undertaking to accomplish the transaction to which ft
refers as required by his laws.
See Kissing the Book.
Assertory Oath. One relating to a past or pres-
ent fact or state of facts, as distinguished from a
"promissory" oath which relates to future con-
duct; particularly, any oath required by law other
than in judicial proceedings and upon induction to
office, such, for example, as an oath to be made
at the custom-house relative to goods imported.
Corporal Oath. See Corporal.
Decisive or Decisory Oath. In the civil law,
where one of the parties to a suit, not being able
to prove his charge, offered to refer the decision
of the cause to the oath of his adversary, which
the adversary was bound to accept, or tender the
same proposal back again, otherwise the whole
was taken as confessed by him. Cod. 4, 1, 12.
Extrajudicial Oath. One not taken in any judi-
cial proceeding, or without any authority or re-
quirement of law, though taken formally before a
proper person. State v. Scatena, 84 Minn. 281, 87
N.W. 764.
False Oath. See titles "False Oath" and "Per-
jury."
Judicial Oath. One taken in some judicial pro-
ceeding or in relation to some matter connected
with judicial proceedings. One taken before an
officer in open court, as distinguished from a "non-
judicial" oath, which is taken before an officer ex
parte or out of court. State v. Dreifus, 38 La.Ann.
Official Oath. One taken by an officer when he
assumes charge of his office, whereby he declares
that he will faithfully discharge the duties of the
same, or whatever else may be required by statute
in the particular case.
Poor Debtor's Oath. See Poor.
Promissory Oaths. Oaths which bind the party
to observe a certain course of conduct, or to fulfill
certain duties, in the future, or to demean himself
thereafter in a stated manner with reference to
specified objects or obligations; such, for example,
as the oath taken by a high executive officer, a
legislator, a judge, a person seeking naturalization,
an attorney at law. Case v. People, 6 Abb. N. C.,
N.Y., 151. A solemn appeal to God, or, in a wider
sense, to some superior sanction or a sacred or
revered person in witness of the inviolability of
a promise or undertaking. People ex rel. Bryant
v. Zimmerman, 241 N.Y. 405, 150 N.E. 497, 499, 43
A.L.R. 909.
Purgatory Oath. An oath by which a person
purges or clears himself from presumptions,
charges or suspicions standing against him, or
from a contempt.
Qualified Oath. One the force of which as an
affirmation or denial may be qualified or modified
by the circumstances under which it is taken or
which necessarily enter into it and constitute a
part of it; especially thus used in Scotch law.
Solemn Oath. A corporal oath. Jackson v.
State, 1 Ind. 184.
Suppletory Oath. In the civil and ecclesiastical
law, the testimony of a single witness to a fact
is called "half-proof," on which no sentence can
be founded; in order to supply the other half of
proof, the party himself (plaintiff or defendant)
is admitted to be examined in his own behalf, and
the oath administered to him for that purpose is
called the "suppletory oath," because it supplies
the necessary quantum of proof on which to found
the sentence. 3 Bl. Comm. 370.
This term, although without4pplication in American
law in its original sense, is somefimes used as a designa-
tion of a party's oath required to be taken in authentica-
tion or support of some piece of documentary evidence
which he offers, for example, his books of account.
Voluntary Oath. Such as a person may take in
extrajudicial matters, and not regularly in a court
of justice, or before an officer invested with au-
thority to administer the same. Brown.

Mozley & Whiteley.

## OATH IN LITEM

In the civil law, an oath per-
mitted to be taken by the plaintiff, for the pur-
pose of proving the value of the subject-matter
in controversy, when there was no other evidence
on that point, or when the defendant fraudulently

able. Greenl. Ev. § 348; 1 Eq. Cas. Abr. 229; Her-
man v. Drinkwater, 1 Greenl., Me., 27.

## OATH OF ALLEGIANCE

An oath by which a
person promises and binds himself to bear true
allegiance to a particular sovereign or govern-
ment, e. g., the United States; administered gen-
erally to high public officers and to soldiers and
sailors, also to aliens applying for naturalization,
and, occasionally, to citizens generally as a pre-
requisite to their suing in the courts or prosecut-
ing claims before government bureaus. Rev.St.

## OATH OF CALUMNY

In the civil law, an oath
which a plaintiff was obliged to take that he was
not prompted by malice or trickery in commenc-
ing his action, but that he had bona f ide a good
cause of action. Poth. Pand. lib. 5, tt. 16, 17, s.

## OATH-RITE

The form used at the taking of an

phrases and maxims, commencing with this word,
are more commonly introduced by "in" (q. v.).

## OB CAUSAM ALIQUAM A RE MARITIMA OR- TAM

For some cause arising out of a maritime
matter. 1 Pet. Adm. 92. Said to be Selden's trans-
lation of the French definition of admiralty juris-
diction, "pour le fait de la mer." Id.
OB CONTINENTIAM DELICTL On account of
contiguity to the offense, i. e., being contaminated
by conjunction with something illegal.
For example, the cargo of a vessel, though not contra-
band or unlawful, may be condemned in admiralty, along
with the vessel, when the vessel has been engaged in some
service which renders her liable to seizure and confiscation.
The cargo is then said to be condemned ob continentiam
delicti, because found in company with an unlawful serv-
ice. 1 Kent, Comm. 152.

## OB CONTINGENTIAM

On account of connec-
tion; by reason of similarity. In Scotch law, this
phrase expresses a ground for the consolidation
of actions.

In favor of mer-
chants. Fleta, lib. 2, c. 63, § 12.
OB INFAMIAM NON SOLET JUXTA LEGEM
TERR1E ALIQUIS PER LEGEM APPARENTEM
SE PURGARE, NISI PRIUS CONVICTUS FUER-
IT VEL CONFESSUS IN CURIA. Glan. lib. 14, c.
ii. On account of evil report, it is not usual, ac-
cording to the law of the land, for any person to
purge himself, unless he have been previously con-
victed, or confessed in court.

or analogy or argument. See Dictum.
OBJECT, In legal proceedings, to object (e. g.,
to the admission of evidence) is to interpose a

or thing under consideration is not done or admit-
ted with the consent of the party objecting, but is

OBLATIONES DICUNTUR QUZECUNQUE A.
HIS FIDELIBUSQUE CHRISTIAN'S OFFER-
UNTUR DEO ET ECCLESLE, SIVE RES SOLI-
DIE SIVE MOBILES. 2 Inst. 389. Those things

## OBLIGATE

To bind or constrain; to bind to the
observance or performance of a duty; to place
under an obligation. To bind one's self by an
obligation or promise; to assume a duty; to ex-
ecute a written promise or covenant; to make a
writing obligatory. Wachter v. Famachon, 62 Wis.
117, 22 N.W. 160; Maxwell v. Jacksonville Loan &
Imp. Co., 45 Fla. 425, 34 So. 255.

## OBLIGATIO

Lat. In Roman law, a legal bond
which obliges the performance of something in
accordance with the law of the land. Ortolan,
Inst. 2, § 1179. It corresponded nearly to our word
contract. The legal relation existing between two
certain persons whereby one (the creditor) is au-
thorized to demand of the other (the debtor) a
certain performance which has a money value.
In this sense obligatio signifies not only the duty
of the debtor, but also the right of the creditor.
The fact establishing such claim and debt, as also
the instrument evidencing it, is termed "obliga-
tion." Mackeld. Rom. Law, § 360.
That legal relation subsisting between two persons by
which one is bound to the other for a certain performance.
The passive relation sustained by the debtor to the creditor
is likewise called an "obligation." Sometimes, also, the
term "obligatio" is used for the oausa obligationis, and the
contract itself is designated an "obligation." There are
passages in which even the document which affords the
proof of a contract is called an "obligation." Such appli-
cations, however, are but a loose extension of the term,
which, according to its true idea, is only properly em-
ployed when it is used to denote the debt relationship, in
its totality, active and passive, subsisting between the
creditor and the debtor. Tomk. & J.Mod.Rom.Law, 301.

## OBLIGATIO CIVILIS

An obligation enforceable
by action, whether it derives its origin from the
jus civile, as the obligation engendered by formal
contracts or the obligation enforceable by bilater-
ally penal suits, or from such portion of the jus
gentium as had been completely naturalized in
the civil law and protected by all its remedies, such,
as the obligation engendered by formless con-
tracts.

## OBLIGATIO EX CONTRACTU

An obligation
arising from contract, or an antecedent jus in per-
sonam. In this there are two stages,—first, a
primary or sanctioned personal right antecedent to
wrong, and, afterwards, a secondary or sanction-
ing personal right consequent on a wrong. Poste's
Gaius' Inst. 359.

## OBLIGATIO EX DELICTO, or OBLIGATIO EX MALEFICIO

An obligation founded on wrong or
tort, or arising from the invasion of a jus in rem.
In this there is the second stage, a secondary or
sanctioning personal right consequent on a wrong,
but the first stage is not a personal right, (jus in,
personam,) but a real right, (jus in rem,) wheth-
er a primordial right, right of status, or of proper-
OBLIGATIO NATURAL'S. An obligation not im-
mediately enforceable by action; one deriving its
validity from the law of nature, or one imposed
by that portion of the jus gentium which is only
imperfectly recognized by civil law.
These had not the binding force of the other classes, not
being capable of enforcement by action, and are, therefore,
not noticed by Justinian in his classification; but they had,
nevertheless, a certain efficacy even in the civil law: for
instance, though a debt founded upon a natural obligation
could not be recovered by an action, yet if it was volun-
tarily paid by the debtor he could not recover it back, as
he might do in the case of money paid by mistake, etc.,
where no natural obligation existed. L. 38, pr. D. 12. 6;
Ortolan 2, § 1180.

## OBLIGATIO PRJETORIA

The Romans consid-
ered that obligations derived their validity solely
from positive law. At first the only ones recog-
nized were those established in special cases in
accordance with the forms prescribed by the strict
jus civile. In the course of time, however, the
praetorian jurisdiction, in mitigation of the prim-
tive rigor of the law, introduced new modes of
contracting obligations and provided the means of
enforcing them; hence the twofold division made
by Justinian of obligationes civiles and obliga-
tiones prcetorice. Inst. 1. 3. 13.

## OBLIGATION

A generic word, derived from the
Latin substantive "obligatio," having many, wide,
and varied meanings, according to the context in
which it is used. Enyeart v. City of Lincoln, 136
Neb. 146, 285 N.W. 314, 318. That which a person
is bound to do or forbear; any duty imposed by
law, promise, contract, relations of society, cour-
tesy, kindness, etc. Goodwin v. Freadrich, 135
Neb. 203, 280 N.W. 917, 923. Duty. Rucks-Brandt
Const. Co. v. Price, 165 Oki. 178, 23 P.2d 690. Duty
imposed by law. Helvering v. British-American
Tobacco Co., C.C.A., 69 F.2d 528, 530. Law or duty
binding parties to perform their agreement. An
undertaking to perform. State v. Citrus County,
116 Fla. 676, 157 So. 4, 97 A.L.R. 431. That which
constitutes a legal or moral duty and which ren-
ders a person liable to coercion and punishment
for neglecting it; a word of broad meaning, and
the particular meaning intended is to be gained
by consideration of its context. An obligation or
debt may exist by reason of a judgment as well
as an express contract, in either case there being
a legal duty on the part of the one bound to com-
ply with the promise. Schwartz v. California
Claim Service, 52 Cal.App.2d 47, 125 P.2d 883, 888.
Liabilities created by contract or law, Rose v. W.
B. Worthen Co., 186 Ark. 205, 53 S.W.2d 15, 16, 85
A.L.R. 212; or tort. Exchange Bank v. Ford, 3
P. 449, 451, 7 Colo. 314. As legal term word orig-
inally meant a sealed bond, but it now extends to
any certain written promise to pay money or do a
specific thing. Lee v. Kenan, C.C.A.Fla., 78 F.2d
425, 100 A.L.R. 869. A formal and binding agree-
ment or acknowledgment of a liability to pay a
certain sum or do a certain thing. United States
v. One Zumstein Briefmarken Katalog 1938, D.C.
Pa., 24 F.Supp. 516, 519.
The binding power of a vow, promise, oath, or contract,
or of law, civil, political, or moral, independent of a prom-
renders a person liable to coercion and punishment for neg-
lecting it. Webster.
A tie which binds us to pay or do something agreeably
to the laws and customs of the country in which the obliga-
tion is made. Inst. 3, 14.
Obligation is (1) legal or moral duty, as opposed to
physical compulsion; (2) a duty incumbent upon an in-
dividual, or a specific and limited number of individuals,
as opposed to a duty imposed upon the world at large; (3)
the right to enforce such a duty, (jus in personam,) as
opposed to such a right as that of property, (jus in rem,)
which avails against the world at large; (4) a bond con-
taining a penalty, with a condition annexed, for the pay-
ment of money, performance of covenants, or the like.
Mozley & Whitley.
"Obligation" is the correlative of "right." Taking the
latter word in its politico-ethical sense, as a power of free
action lodged in a person, "obligation" is the correspond-
ing duty, constraint, or binding force which should prevent
all other persons from denying, abridging, or obstructing
such right, or interfering with its exercise. And the same
is its meaning as the correlative of a "jus in rem." Tak-
ing "right" as meaning a "jus in personam," (a power,
demand, claim, or privilege inherent in one person, and
incident upon another,) the "obligation" is the coercive
force or control imposed upon the person of incidence by
the moral law and the positive law, (or the moral law as
recognized and sanctioned by the positive law,) constrain-
ing him to accede to the demand, render up the thing
claimed, pay the money due, or otherwise perform what is
expected of him with respect to the subject-matter of the
right.
A penal bond or "writing obligatory," that is, a bond
containing a penalty, with a condition annexed for the pay-
ment of money, performance of covenants, or the like, and
which differs from a bill, the latter being generally with-
out a penalty or condition, though it may be obligatory.
Co. Litt. 172.
A deed whereby a man binds himself under a penalty to
do a thing. Com.Dig. Obligation (A) ; Taylor v. Glaser, 2
Serg. & R., Pa., 502; Denton v. Adams, 6 Vt. 40. The
word has a very broad and comprehensive legal significa-
tion and embraces all instruments of writing, however
informal, whereby one party contracts with another for
the payment of money or the delivery of specific articles.
State v. Campbell, 103 N.C. 344, 9 S.E. 410; Morrison v.
Lovejoy, 6 Minn. 353, Gil. 224; Sinton v. Carter Co., 23
F. 535.
In English expositions of the Roman law, and works
upon general jurisprudence, "obligation" is used to trans-
late the Latin "obligatio." In this sense its meaning is
much wider than as a technical term of English law. See
Obligatio.
Absolute obligation. One which gives no alter-
native to the obligor, but requires fulfillment ac-
cording to the engagement.
Conjunctive or alternative obligation. The for-
mer is one in which the several objects in it are
connected by a copulative, or in any other manner
which shows that all of them are severally com-
prised in the contract. This contract creates as
many different obligations as there are different
objects; and the debtor, when he wishes to dis-
charge himself, may force the creditor to receive
them separately. But where the things which
form the object of the contract are separated by
a disjunctive, then the obligation is alternative,
and the performance of either of such things will
discharge the obligor. The choice of performing
one of the obligations belongs to the obligor, un-
less it is expressly agreed that it shall belong
to the creditor. Civ.Code La. art. 2068; Dougl. 14;
1 Ld. Raym. 279; Galloway v. Legan, 4 Mart. N.
S. (La.) 167. A promise to deliver a certain thing
of an alternative obligation. Civ.Code La. arts.
2063, 2066, 2067.
Contractual obligation. One which arises from
a contract or agreement.
Determinate or indeterminate obligation. A de-
terminate obligation is one which has for its ob-
ject a certain thing: as, an obligation to deliver a
certain horse named Bucephalus, in which case
the obligation can be discharged only by delivering
the identical horse. An indeterminate obligation
is one where the obligor binds himself to deliver
one of a certain species: as, to deliver a horse,
where the delivery of any horse will discharge the
obligation.
Divisible or indivisible obligation. A divisible
obligation is one which, being a unit, may never-
theless be lawfully divided, with or without the
consent of the parties. An indivisible obligation
is one which is not susceptible of division: as, for
example, ,if I promise to pay you one hundred dol-
lars, you cannot assign one-half of this to anoth-
er, so as to give him a right of action against me
for his share.
Express or implied obligation. Express or con-
ventional obligations are those by which the ob-
ligor binds himself in express terms to perform his
obligation, while implied obligations are such as
are raised by the implication or inference of the
law from the nature of the transaction.
Failure to meet obligations. See Failure to Meet
Obligations.
Joint or several obligation. A joint obligation
is one by which two or more obligors bind them-
selves jointly for the performance of the obliga-
tion. France v. France, 94 Or. 414, 185 P. 1108.
A several obligation is one where the obligors
promise, each for himself, to fulfill the engage-
ment.
Moral obligation. A duty which is valid and
binding in conscience and according to natural
justice, but is not recognized by the law as ade-
quate to set in motion the machinery of justice;
that is, one which rests upon ethical considerations
alone, and is not imposed or enforced by positive
law. Taylor v. Hotchkiss, 81 App.Div. 470, 80 N.
Y.S. 1042; Bailey v. Philadelphia, 167 Pa. 569, 31
A. 925, 46 Am.St.Rep. 691. A duty which would be
enforceable by law, were it not for some positive
rule, which, with a view to general benefit, ex-
empts the party in that particular instance from
legal liability. Backhaus v. Lee, 49 N.D. 821, 194
N.W. 887, 890; Longstreth v. City of Philadelphia,
245 Pa. 233, 91 A. 667.
Natural or civil obligation. A natural obliga-
tion is one which cannot be enforced by action,
but which is binding on the party who makes it
in conscience and according to natural justice;
Blair v. Williams, 4 Litt., Ky., 41. As, for instance,
when the action is barred by the act of limitation,
a natural obligation still subsists, although the
civil obligation is extinguished; Sturges v. Crown-
Saunders, 12 Wheat. 318, 337, 6 L.Ed. 606. A civil
obligation is a legal tie, which gives the party
with whom it is contracted the right of enforcing
its performance by law. Civ.Code La. art. 1757;
Poth. Obl. 173, 191.
Obedientlal obligation. One incumbent on par-
ties in consequence of the situation or relation-
ship in which they are placed. Ersk. Prin. 60.
Perfect or imperfect obligation. A perfect obli-
gation is one recognized and sanctioned by posi-
tive law; one of which the fulfillment can be en-
forced by the aid of the law. Aycock v. Martin,
37 Ga. 124, 92 Am.Dec. 56. But if the duty created
by the obligation operates only on the moral sense,
without being enforced by any positive law, it is
called an "imperfect obligation," and creates no
right of action, nor has it any legal operation. The
duty of exercising gratitude, charity, and the other
merely moral duties are examples of this kind of
obligation. Civ.Code La. art. 1757; Edwards v.
Kearzey, 96 U.S. 600, 24 L.Ed. 793.
Personal or heritable obligation. An obligation
is heritable when the heirs and assigns of one
party may enforce the performance against the
heirs of the other. Civ.Code La. art. 1997. It is
personal when the obligor binds himself only, not
his heirs or representatives. An obligation is
strictly personal when none but the obligee can
enforce the performance, or when it can be en-
forced only against the obligor. Civ.Code La. art.
1997. An obligation may be personal as to the ob-
ligee, and heritable as to the obligor, and it may
in like manner be heritable as to the obligee, and
personal as to the obligor. Civ.Code La. art. 1998.
For the term personal obligation, as used in a dif-
ferent sense, see the next paragraph.
Personal or real obligation. A personal obliga-
tion is one by which the obligor binds himself to
perform an act, without directly binding his prop-
erty for its performance. A real obligation is one
by which real estate, and not the person, is liable
to the obligee for the performance.
Thus, when an estate owes an easement, as a right of
way, it is the thing, and not the owner, who owes the ease-
ment. Another instance of a real obligation occurs when
a person buys an estate which has been mortgaged, sub-
ject to the mortgage; he is not liable for the debt, though
the estate is. In these cases the owner has an interest
only because he is seized of the servient estate or the mort-
gaged premises, and he may discharge himself by abandon-
ing or parting with the property. The obligation is both
personal and real when the obligor has bound himself and
pledged his estate for the fulfilment of the obligations. In
the civil law and in Louisiana, a real obligation is one
which is attached to immovable property, and it passes
with such property into whatever hands the property may
come, without making the third possessor personally re-
sponsible. Civ.Code La. art. 1997.
Primary obligation. An obligation which is the
principal object of the contract.
For example, the primary obligation of the seller is to
deliver the thing sold, and to transfer the title to it. It is
distinguished from the accessory or secondary obligation
to pay damages for not doing so. 1 Bouv.Inst. no. 702.
The words "primary" and "direct," contrasted with "sec-
ondary," when spoken with reference to an obligation,
gation, rather than to the character and limits of the obli-
gation itself. Kilton v. Providence Tool Co., 22 R.I. 605,
48 A. 1039.
Primitive or secondary obligation. A primitive
obligation, which in one sense may also be called
a principal obligation, is one which is contracted
with a design that it should itself be the first ful-
filled. A secondary obligation is one which is con-
tracted and is to be performed in case the primi-
tive cannot be. For example, if one sells his house,
he binds himself to give a title; but if he finds he
cannot as when the title is in another, then his
secondary obligation is to pay damages for non-
performance of the obligation.
Principal or accessory obligation. A principal
obligation is one which arises from the principal
object of the engagement of the contracting par-
ties; while an accessory obligation depends upon
or is collateral to the principal. See Poth. Obl. no.
For example, in the case of the sale of a house and lot
of ground, the principal obligation on the part of the ven-
dor is to make title for it; the accessory obligation is to
deliver all the title-papers which the vendor has relating
to it, to take care of the estate until it is delivered, and
the like. See, further, the title Accessory Obligation.
Pure obligation. One which is not suspended
by any condition, whether it has been contracted
without any condition, or, when thus contracted,
the condition has been accomplished. Poth. Obl.
no. 176. See simple obligation.
Simple or conditional obligation. Simple obliga-
tions are such as are not dependent for their exe-
cution on any event provided for by the parties,
and which are not agreed to become void on the
happening of any such event. Conditional obliga-
tions are such as are made to depend on an un-
certain event. If the obligation is not to take
effect until the event happens, it is a suspensive
condition; if the obligation takes effect immediate-
ly, but is liable to be defeated when the event hap-
pens, it is then a resolutory condition. Civ.Code
La. arts. 2020, 2021; Moss v. Smoker, 2 La.Ann.
989. A simple obligation is also defined as one
which is not suspended by any condition, either
because it has been contracted without condition,
or, having been contracted with one, the condition
has been fulfilled; and a conditional obligation is
also defined as one the execution of which is sus-
pended by a condition which has not been accom-
plished, and subject to which it has been contract-
ed.
Single or penal obligation. A penal obligation
is one to which is attached a penal clause, which
is to be enforced if the principal obligation be-
not performed. A single obligation is one with-
out any penalty: as where one simply promises to
pay another one hundred dollars. This is called
a single bill, when it is under seal.
Solidary obligation. In the law of Louisiana,
one which binds each of the obligors for the whole
debt, as distinguished from a "joint" obligation,
which binds the parties each for his separate pro-
portion of the debt. Groves v. Sentell, 14 S.Ct.

## OBLIGATION OF A CONTRACT

That which
law in force when contract is made obliges parties
to do or not to do, and remedy and legal means to
carry it into effect. Harris v. Monroe Building &
Loan Ass'n, La.App., 154 So. 503, 505.
As used in Const.U.S. art. 1, § 10, the term means the
binding and coercive force which constrains every man to
perform the agreements he has made; a force grounded in
the ethical principle of fidelity to one's promises, but deriv-
ing its legal efficacy from its recognition by positive law,
and sanctioned by the law's providing a remedy for the
infraction of the duty or for the enforcement of the cor-
relative right. Story, Const. § 1378; Black, Const.Prohib.
§ 139; Ogden v. Saunders, 12 Wheat. 213, 6 L.Ed. 606.
The "obligation of a contract" is its binding force ac-
cording to the standards of law in existence when it was
made. Colby v. City of Medford, 85 Or. 485, 167 P. 487,
499. The "obligation of a contract" is the duty of per-
formance. Hays v. Port of Seattle, D.C.Wash., 226 F. 287,
293. The term includes everything within the obligatory
scope of the contract, and it includes the means of enforce-
ment. E. J. Lander & Co. v. Deemy, 46 N. D. 273, 176 N.W.
922, 925; Franklin Sugar Refining Co. v. Martin-Nelly
Grocery Co., 94 W.Va. 504, 119 S.E. 473, 476.

## OBLIGATION SOLIDAIRE

This, in French law,
corresponds to joint and several liability in Eng-
lish law, but is applied also to the joint and several
rights of the creditors parties to the obligation.

## OBLIGATIONES EX DELICTO or EX MALE- FICIO

Obligations arising from the commission
of a wrongful injury to the person or property of
another.
"Delictum" is not exactly synonymous' with "tort," for,
while it includes most of the wrongs known to the common
law as torts, it is also wide enough to cover some offenses
(such as theft and robbery) primarily injurious to the in-
dividual, but now only punished as crimes. Such acts
gave rise to an obligatio, which consisted in the liability
to pay damages.

## OBLIGATIONES EX VARIIS CAUSARUM FIG- URIS

Athough Justinian confined the divisions
of obligations to four classes, namely obligationes
ex contractu, quasi ex contractu, ex maleficio and
quasi ex male ficio, there are many species of obli-
gations which cannot properly be reduced within
any of these classes. Some authorities have, con-
sequently, established a fifth class, to receive the
odds and ends which belonged nowhere else, and
have given to this class the above designation, bor-
rowed from Gaius, 1. 1, pr. § 1, D. 44, 7; Mackel-
dey § 474; Hadley, Rom. Law 209, etc.

## OBLIGATIONES QUASI EX CONTRACTU

Of-
ten persons who have not contracted with each
other, under a certain state of facts, are regarded
by the Roman law as if they had actually conclud-
ed a convention between themselves. The legal
relation which then takes place between these per-
sons, which has always a similarity to a contract
obligation, is therefore termed obligatio quasi ex
contractu.
Such a relation arises from the conducting of affairs
without authority, (negotiorum gestio) or unauthorized
agency; from the management of property that is in com-
mon when the community arose from casualty, (communio
;Heiden); from the payment of what was not due (solutio
indebiti); from tutorship and curatorship (tutela and
cura), resembling the relation of guardian and ward; from
taking possession of an inheritance (additio hereditatis and
agnitio bonorum possessionis); and in many other cases.

## OBLIGATIONES QUASI EX DELICTO, or OBLI- GATIONES QUASI EX MALIFICIO

This class
embraces all torts not coming under the denomina-
tion of delicta and not having a special form of
action provided for them by law. They differed
widely in character, and at common law would in
some cases give rise to an action on the case, in
others to an action on an implied contract. Ort.
Inst. §§ 1781-1792.

## OBLIGATORY PACT

See Pact.

## OBLIGATORY RIGHTS

See Right
OBLIGATORY WRITING. See Writing Obliga-
tory.

## OBLIGEE

The person in favor of whom some
obligation is contracted, whether such obligation
be to pay money or to do or not to do something.
Code La. art. 3522, no. 11 (Civ.Code, art. 3556, subd.
20). Jenkins v. Williams, 191 Ky. 165, 229 S.W. 94,
95. The party to whom a bond is given.
Obligees are either several or joint. An obligee is sev-
eral when the obligation is made to him alone; obligees
are joint when the obligation is made to two or more; and
in that event each is not a creditor for his separate share,
unless the nature of the subject or the particularity of the
expression in the instrument lead to a different conclusion.
2 Pothier, Obl., Evans ed. 56; Hob. 172; Cro.Jac. 251.
The words obligee and payee have been held to have a
technical and definite meaning under an act relative to
promissory notes, bonds, etc., and apply only to notes,
bonds, or bills whether given for the payment of money or
for the performance of covenants and conditions, and not
to mortgages; Hall v. Bryne, 1 Scam., Ill., 142.

## OBLIGOR

The person who has engaged to per-
form some obligation. Code La. art. 3522, no. 12,
Civ.Code, art. 3556, subd. 21. One who makes a
bond.
Includes person liable for tort. Sarine v. Ameri-
can Lumbermen's Casualty Co. of Illinois, 258
App.Div. 653, 17 N.Y.S.2d 754, 756.
Obligors are joint and several. They are joint when
they agree to pay the obligation jointly. They are several
when one or more bind themselves and each of them sepa-
rately to perform the obligation. In order to become an
obligor, the party must actually, either himself or by his
attorney, enter into the obligation and execute it as his
own.

constitutes an obstruction to administration of justice.

en a broad meaning, and includes to hinder, im-
pede, embarrass, and retard, in whole or in part.
Doe v. U. S., C.C.A.Colo., 253 F. 903, 906. The term
does not necessarily mean actual prevention of en-
listments or recruiting, it being sufficient if one
interferes with such service or renders it more
difficult. Rhuberg v. United States, C.C.A.Or., 255
F. 865, 869; U. S. v. Pierce, D.C.N.Y., 245 F. 878,

ing. State v. Malpass, 189 N.C. 349, 127 S.E. 248,
This is the word properly descriptive of an injury to any-
one's incorporeal hereditament, e. g., his right to an ease-
ment, or profit a prendre; an alternative word being "dis-
turbance." On the other hand, "infringement" is the
word properly descriptive of an injury to any one's patent-
rights or to his copyright. But "obstruction" is also a
very general word in law, being applicable to every hin-
drance of a man in the discharge of his duty, (whether
official, public, or private.) Brown.
"Obstruction" in highway includes anything interfering
with highway easement. Andrew B. Hendryx Co. v. City
of New Haven, 104 Conn. 632, 134 A. 77, 79.
"Obstruction," within a statute requiring certain pre-
cautions by those in bharge of train on appearance of ob-
struction, means obstacle, impediment, hindrance, bar, bar-
rier, clog, or check. Howard & Herrin v. Nashville, C. &
St. L. Ry. Co., 153 Tenn. 649, 284 S.W. 894, 896, 46 A.L.R.

62, 63.
As applied to the operation of railroads, an "obstruc-
tion" may be either that which obstructs or hinders the
free and safe passage of a train, or that which may receive
an injury or damage, such as it would be unlawful to in-
flict, if run over or against by the train, as in the case of
cattle or a man approaching on the track. Louisville N. &
G. R. Co. v. Reidmond, 11 Lea, Tenn., 205; South & North

The word in statute relating to obtaining money or prop-
erty by false pretenses, is not limited to getting, securing,
or appropriating money or property as owner. It includes
as well the getting or securing of money or property by
way of a loan. Tingue v. State, 90 Ohio St. 368, 108 N.E.
222, 223, Ann.Cas.1916C, 1156. As used in a confidence
game statute it means to acquire the possession of, or con-
trol of, and not necessarily to acquire title to. People v.
Miller, 278 Ill. 490, 116 N.E. 131, 138, L.R.A.1917E, 797.

## OCCUPANCY

Occupancy is a mode of acquir-
ing property by which a thing which belongs to
nobody becomes the property of the person who
took possession of it with the intention of acquir-
ing a right of ownership in it. Civ. Code La. art.
3412; Goddard v. Winchell, 86 Iowa, 71, 52 N.W.
1124, 17 L.R.A. 788, 41 Am.St.Rep. 481. The taking
possession of things which before belonged to no-
body, with an intention of appropriating them to
one's own use. To constitute occupancy, there
must be a taking of a thing corporeal, belonging
to nobody, with an intention of becoming the own-
er of it; Co. Litt. 416.
Occupancy is sometimes used in the sense of occupation
or holding possession; indeed it has come to be very gen-
erally so used in this country in homestead laws, public-
land laws, and the like, Walters v. People, 21 Ill. 178;
Redfield v. R. Co., 25 Barb., N.Y., 54; Act of Cong. May
29, 1830, 4 Stat. 420; but this does not appear to be a com-
mon legal use of the term, as recognized by English au-
thorities.
There is a use of the word in public-land laws, home-
stead laws, "occupying-claimant" laws, cases of landlord
and tenant, and like connections, which seems to require
the broader sense of possession, although there is, in most
of these uses, a shade of meaning discarding any prior title
as a foundation of right. Perhaps both uses or views may
be harmonized, by saying that in jurisprudence occupancy
or occupation is possession, presented independent of the
idea of a chain of title, of any earlier owner. Or "occu-
pancy" and "occupant" might be used for assuming prop-
erty which has no owner, and "occupation" and "occu-
pier" for the more general idea of possession. Judge
Bouvier's definitions seem partly founded on such a distinc-
tion, and there are indications of it in English usage. It
does not appear generally drawn in American books. Ab-
bott.
"Possession" and "occupancy," when applied to land,
are nearly synonymous terms, and may exist through a
tenancy. Thus, occupancy of a homestead, such as will
satisfy the statute, may be by means other than that of
actual residence on the premises by the widow or child.
Walters v. People, 21 Ill. 178. Occupancy is always actual,
as distinguished from possession, which may be actual or
constructive. Occupancy is never constructive, save in the
sense that land may be occupied through the actual pos-
session of another. Davis v. State, 20 Ga.App. 68, 92 S.E.
550, 551. "Occupancy" is act of taking or holding posses-
sion and does not necessarily include residence. Korn-
hauser v. National Surety Co., 114 Ohio St. 24, 150 N.E.
921, 923.
Under fire policy, it must be such as ordinarily
pertains to purpose to which property is adapted
or devoted as described in policy. Continental Ins.
Co. of New York v. Dunning, 249 Ky. 234, 60 S.W.
2d 577.
Under burglary policy it implies an actual use
of the house as a dwelling place not absolutely con-
tinuous, but as a place of/usual return. Young v.
Fidelity & Casualty Co. of New York, 202 Mo.App.
319, 215 S.W. 496, 498.
Under statute respecting adverse possession, the
term was synonymous with "actual possession,"
as distinguished from "constructive possession."
Hart v. All Persons, 26 Cal.App. 664, 148 P. 236,
See Occupation; Occupy.
In International law. The taking possession of
a newly discovered or conquered country with the
intention of holding and ruling it.

## OCCUPANT

Person having possessory rights,
who can control what goes on on premises. Unit-
ed States v. Fox, C.C.A.N.Y., 60 F.2d 685, 688.
One who takes the first possession of a thing
of which there is no owner.
One who occupies and takes possession, one who
has the actual use, possession or control of a thing.
Lechler v. Chapin, 12 Nev. 65; Wittkop v. Garner,
4 N.J.Misc. 234, 132 A. 339, 340.
In a special sense, one who takes possession of
lands held pur autre vie, after the death of the
tenant, and during the life of the cestui que vie.
Common occupant. See general occupant, be-
low.
General occupant. At common law where a
man was tenant pur autre vie, or had an estate
granted to himself only (without mentioning his
heirs) for the life of another man, and died with-
out alienation during the life of cestui que vie, or
him by whose life it was holden, he that could
first enter on the land might lawfully retain the
possession, so long as cestui que vie lived, by right
of occupancy, and was hence termed a "general"
or common "occupant." 1 Steph.Comm. 415.
Special occupant. A person having a special
right to enter upon and occupy lands granted pur
autre vie, on the death of the tenant, and during
the life of cestui que vie.
Where the grant is to a man and his heirs during the
life of cestui que vie, the heir, succeeds as special occupant,
having a special exclusive right by the terms of the orig-
inal grant. 2 Bl.Comm. 259; 1 Steph.Comm. 416.
In the United States the statute provisions of the differ-
ent states vary considerably upon this subject. In New
York and New Jersey, special occupancy is abolished.
Virginia, and probably Maryland, follow the English stat-
utes. In Massachusetts and other states, where the real
and personal estates of intestates are distributed in the
same way and manner, the question does not seem to be
material. 4 Kent 27.

## OCCUPATION TAX

A tax imposed upon an oc-
cupation or the prosecution of a business, trade,
or profession; not a tax on property, or even the

is not sufficient, to entitle an employer to have
a reduction in the weekly compensation ordered by
the court under the Workmen's Compensation Act,
that it appears the workman has the physical ca-
pacity to do some kind of work different from
the general kind of work which he was engaged
in at the time of the accident, but it must also be
shown that the workman, either by his own efforts
or that of his employer, can actually get such
work. Olneyville Wool Combing Co. v. Di Donato,

existing as a binding or obligatory power.

## OF GRACE

This phrase had its origin in an age
when kings dispensed their royal favors at the
hands of chancellors, but has no rightful place in
American jurisprudence. Sullivan v. Jones &
Laughlin Steel Co., 208 Pa. 540, 57 A. 1065, 66 L.R.
A. 712. A term applied to any permission or li-
cense granted to a party in the course of a judi-
cial proceeding which is not claimable as a matter

or indulgence of the court. See Walters v. McEl-
roy, 151 Pa. 549, 25 A. 125.

## OF NEW

A mortgage to be "of record" must be recorded in the
county in which it is properly and legally .recordable for
purpose of constructive notice. Riley v. Commonwealth,
275 Ky. 370, 121 S.W.2d 921.
Under statute providing that recognizances shall be "of
record", the term means of record in the sense that it is
taken by inferior tribunals-that they have been taken and
certified to the clerk of the court of record and by him
recorded. King v. State, 18 Neb. 375, 25 N.W. 519.

App. 91, 220 P. 447; State v. Hirsch, 91 Vt. 330, 100
A. 877, 879; Ex parte Brady, 116 Ohio St. 512, 157
N.E. 69, 70. State v. Johnson, 212 N.C. 566, 194
S.E. 319, 322.
It is used as a genus, comprehending every
crime and misdemeanor, or as a species, signify-
ing a crime not indictable, but punishable sum-
marily or by the forfeiture of a penalty. In re
Terry, C.C.Cal., 37 F. 649.
The word "offense," while sometimes used in various
senses, generally implies a crime or a misdemeanor in-
fringing public as distinguished from mere private rights,
and punishable under the criminal laws, though it may
also include the violation of a criminal statute for which
the remedy is merely a civil suit to recover the penalty.
Commonwealth v. Brown, 264 Pa. 85, 107 A. 676, 678.
Under a statute, declaring that one guilty of an offense•
or fault causing another damage is obliged to repair it,
"offense or fault" has the same meaning as "tort" ; Pana-
ma R. Co. v. Rock, C.C.A.Canal Zone, 272 F. 649, 651; and.
Creekmore v. U. S., C.C.A.Okl., 237 F. 743, 754, L.R.A.

645, 646; Staniforth v. State, 24 Ohio App. 208,
156 N.E. 924.
It is the previous conviction, and not the indict-
ment, which is the basis of the charge of a second
offense. People v. Boardman, 172 App.Div. 733, 159
N.Y.S. 577.

## OFFENSIVE

In the law relating to nuisances
and similar matters, this term means noxious,
causing annoyance, discomfort, or painful or disa-
greeable sensations. In ordinary use, the term

ful. Moller v. Presbyterian Hospital, 65 App.Div.

ly" or "dangerous" weapon. State v. Dineen, 10
Rex v. Noakes, 5 Car. & P. 326. Pistol has been
held to be "offensive weapon" within statute pun-
ishing assault with intent to rob. Reed v. Com-
monwealth, 281 Ky. 189, 135 S.W.2d 867, 870, 872.

## OFFER

To bring to or before; to present for
acceptance or rejection; to hold out or proffer;
to make a proposal to; to exhibit something that
may be taken or received or not. Morrison v.
Springer, 15 Iowa 346; People v. Ah Fook, 62 Cal.
To attempt or endeavor; to make an .effort to
effect some object, as, to offer to bribe; in this
sense used principally in criminal law. State v.
Armijo, 19 N.M. 345, 142 P. 1126, 1127.
In trial practice, to "offer" evidence is to state its nature
and purport, or to recite what is expected to be proved by
a given witness or document, and demand its admission.
Unless under exceptional circumstances, the term is not
to be taken as equivalent to "introduce." Harris v. Tom-
linson, 130 Ind. 426, 30 N.E. 214.
The word "offer," as used in a statute providing that the
buyer, to rescind a sale, must offer within a reasonable
time to return the goods, is synonymous with the word
"tender." Collins v. Skillings, 224 Mass. 275, 112 N.E. 938.
939, Ann.Cas.1918D, 424.

## OFFER

A proposal; a proposal to do a thing.
An attempt; endeavor. Webster.
An offer of evidence. See the verb "offer,"
supra.
An act on the part of one person whereby he
gives to another the legal power of creating the
obligation called contract. In re Larney's Estate,
148 Misc. 871, 266 N.Y.S. 564.
An offer, as an element of a contract, is a proposal to
make a contract. It must be made by the person who is
to make the promise, and it must be made to the person
to whom the promise is made. It may be made either by
words or by signs, either orally or in writing, and either
personally or by a messenger; but in whatever way it is
made, it is not in law an offer until it comes to the knowl-
edge of the person to whom it is made; Langd.Contr.
151; 6 H.L.Cas. 112. See Sunburst Oil & Gas Co, v. Ne-
ville, 79 Mont. 550, 257 P. 1016, 1019.
An "offer" must be so definite in its terms, or require
such definite terms in acceptance, that the promises and
performances to be rendered by each party are reasonably
certain. Wadge v. Crestwood Acres, 128 N.J.L. 551, 27
A.2d 148, 150.
An "offer to sell" merely contemplates the proffer, pro-
posal, presentation, or exhibition of something to another-

01+ ERTORIUM. In English ecclesiastical law.
The offerings of the faithful, or the place where

the Communion.

## OFFICE

Right to exercise public or private em-
ployment, and to take the fees and emoluments
thereunto belonging, whether public, as those of
magistrates, or private, as of bailiffs, receivers, or
the like. 2 Bl.Comm. 36. Blair v. Marye, 80 Va.
495; Worthy v. Barrett, 63 N.C. 202; Shelf. Mortm.
797; Cruise, Dig. Index; Com. v. Sutherland, 3
S. & R., Pa., 149. A right, and correspondent duty,
to exercise a public trust. Whitehead v. Clark, 146
Tenn. 660, 244 S.W. 479, 482. A public charge or
employment; U. S. v. Maurice, 2 Brock. 102, Fed.
Cas. No. 15,747, per Marshall, C. J.; Lamar v.
Splain, 42 App.D.C. 300, 305. An employment on
behalf of the government in any station or pub-
lic trust, not merely transient, occasional, or in-
cidental. See Eason v. Majors, 111 Neb. 288, 196
N.W. 133, 134, 30 A.L.R. 1419.
An "assigned duty" or "function." Synonyms are
"post", "appointment", "situation", "place", "position",
and "office" commonly suggests a position of (especially
public) trust or authority. Also right to exercise a public
function or employment, and to take the fees and emolu-
ments belonging to it. Frazier v. Elmore, 180 Tenn. 232,
173 S.W.2d 563, 565. A public charge or employment, and
he who performs the duties of the office is an officer. Al-
though an office is an employment, it does not follow that
every employment is an office. A man may be employed
under a contract, express or implied, to do an act, or to
perform a service, without becoming an officer. But, if the
duty be a continuing one, which is defined by rule pre-
scribed by the government, which an individual is appoint-
ed by the government to perform, who enters upon the
duties appertaining to his status, without any contract de-
fining them, it seems very difficult to distinguish such a
charge or employment from an office, or the person who
performs the duty from an officer. Lacy v. State, 13 Ala.
App. 212, 68 So. 706, 710. In the constitutional sense, the
term implies an authority to exercise some portion of the
sovereign power, either in making, executing, or adminis-
tering the laws. State v. Christmas, 126 Miss. 358, 88 So.
881, 882.
The most frequent occasions to use the word
arise with reference to a duty and power conferred
on an individual by the government; and, when
this is the connection, "public office" is a usual
and more discriminating expression. But a power
and duty may exist without immediate grant from
government, and may be properly called an "of-
fice;" as the office of executor, the office of ste-
ward. Here the individual acts towards legatees
or towards tenants in performance of a duty, and
in exercise of a power not derived from their con-
sent, but devolved on him by an authority which
quoad hoc is superior. Abbott.
A place for the regular transaction of business.
Bradley v. Certigue Mining & Dredging Co., 157
N.Y.S. 275, 276, 93 Misc. 519. For the word "office"
as used of a place for transacting public business,
see Corn. v. White, 6 Cush., Mass., 181.
"Office" is frequently used in the old books as
an abbreviation for "inquest of office," (q. v.).
As to various particular offices, see Land Office,
Petty Bag Office, Post Office, etc.
Civil office. Distinguished from military. Wal-
do v. Wallace, 12 Ind. 569.

law, an office filled by the electorate of the entire
county. Hamilton v. Monroe, Tex.Civ.App., 287 S.
W. 304, 306,
District office. As used in a primary election
law, an office filled by the electorate of a district.
Hamilton v. Monroe, Tex.Civ.App., 287 S.W. 304,
Judicial office. See Judicial.
Lucrative office. See Lucrative.
Military office. Such as are held by soldiers and
sailors for military purposes.
Ministerial office. One. which gives the officer
no discretion as to the matter to be done, and re-
quires him to obey mandates of a superior. Vose
v. Deane, 7 Mass. 280; Savacool v. Boughton, 5
Wend., N.Y., 170, 21 Am.Dec. 181; Waldo v. Wal-
lace, 12 Ind. 569. It is a general rule that a judi-
cial office cannot be exercised by deputy, while a
ministerial office may.
Office book. Any book for the record of official
or other transactions, kept under authority of the
state, in public offices not connected with the
courts.
Office copy. A copy or transcript of a deed or
record or any filed document, made by the officer
having it in custody or under his sanction, and by
him sealed or certified.
A copy made by an officer of the court, bound by law to
make it, is equivalent to an exemplification, though it is
sometimes called an "office copy"; Steph.Dig.Ev. art. 77.
Copies of public records„ whether judicial or otherwise,
made by a public officer authorized by law, to make them,
are often termed "office copies," e. g. copies of recorded
deeds; Elwell v. Cunningham, 74 Me. 127. A copy made
by an officer of the court, who is authorized to make it by
a rule of court, but not required by law to make it, is
equivalent to an exemplification in the same cause and
court, but in other causes or courts is not admissible un-
less it can be proved as an examined copy; Steph.Dig.Ev.
art. 78. These are called "office copies"; Kellogg v.
Kellogg, 6 Barb. (N.Y.) 130.
Office found. In English law. Inquest of office
found; the finding of certain facts by a jury on
an inquest or inquisition of office. 3 Bl.Comm.
258, 259. This phrase has been adopted in Ameri-
can law. 2 Kent, Comm. 61. See Phillips v.
Moore, 100 U.S. 212, 25 L.Ed. 603; Finch v. Gold-
stein, 245 N.Y. 300, 157 N.E. 146, 147.
Office grant. A designation of a conveyance
made by some officer of the law to effect certain
purposes, where the owner is either unwilling or
unable to execute the requisite deeds to pass the
title; such, for example, as a tax-deed. 3 Washb.
Real Prop. *537.
Office hours. That portion of the day during
which public offices are usually open for the trans-
action of business.
Officer of honor. See Honor.
Office of judge. A criminal suit in an eccles-
iastical court, not being directed to the reparation
of a private injury, is regarded as a proceeding
emanating from the office of the judge, and may
be instituted by the mere motion of the judge.
But, in practice, these suits are instituted by pri-
vate individuals, with the permission of the judge
or his surrogate; and the private prosecutor in
any such case is, accordingly, said to "promote the
office of the judge." Mozley & Whiteley.
Political office. Civil offices are usually divided
into three classes,-political, judicial, and minis-
terial. Political offices are such as are not imme-
diately connected with the administration of jus-
tice, or with the execution of the mandates of a
superior, such as the president or the head of a
department. Fitzpatrick v. U. S., 7 Ct.C1. 293.
Principal office. The principal office of a cor-
poration is its headquarters, or the place where
the chief or principal affairs and business of the
corporation are transacted. Usually it is the of-
fice where the company's books are kept, where
its meetings of stockholders are held, and where
the directors, trustees, or managers assemble to
discuss and transact the important general busi-
ness of the company; but no one of these circum-
stances is a controlling test. See Jossey v. Geor-
gia & A. Ry., 102 Ga. 706, 28 S.E. 273; Middletown
Ferry Co. v. Middletown, 40 Conn. 69; In re Lone
Star Shipbuilding Co., C.C.A.N.Y., 6 F.2d 192, 196.
Synonymous with "principal place of business,"
being the place where the principal affairs of a
corporation are transacted. Foreman & Clark
Mfg. Co. v. Bartle, 125 Misc.Rep. 759, 211 N.Y.S.
602, 604.
Public office. The right, authority, and duty
created and conferred by law, by which for a
given period, either fixed by law or enduring at
the pleasure of the creating power, an individual
is invested with some portion of the sovereign
functions of government for the benefit of the
public. Walker v. Rich, 79 Cal.App. 139, 249 P. 56,
58. An agency for the state, the duties of which
involve in their performance the exercise of some
portion of the sovereign power, either great or
small. Yaselli v. Goff, C.C.A., 12 F.2d 396, 403, 56
A.L.R. 1239; Lacey v. State, 13 Ala.App. 212, 68
So. 706, 710; Curtin v. State, 61 Cal.App. 377, 214
P. 1030, 1035; Shelmadine v. City of Elkhart, 75
Ind.App. 493, 129 N.E. 878. State ex rel. Colorado
River Commission v. Frohmiller, 46 Ariz. 413, 52
P.2d 483, 486.
Where, by virtue of law, a person is clothed, not as an
incidental or transient authority, but for such time as de-
notes duration and continuance, with independent power to
control the property of the public, or with public functions
to be exercised in the supposed interest of the people, the
service to be compensated by a stated yearly salary, and
the occupant having a designation or title, the position so
created is a public office. State v. Brennan, 49 Ohio St.
33, 29 N.E. 593.
State office. This term as used in a primary
election law, means offices to be filled by the elec-
torate of the entire state. Hamilton v. Monroe,
Tex.Civ.App., 287 S.W. 304, 306.

## OFFICER

The incumbent of an office; one who
is lawfully invested with an office. Evans v. Beat-
tie, 137 S.C. 496, 135 S.E. 538, 554; State v. Brat-
ton, 148 Tenn. 174, 253 S.W. 705, 706. One who
is charged by a superior power (and particularly
by government) with the power and duty of exer-
cising certain functions.
One who is invested with some portion of the functions of
the government to be exercised for the public benefit. Fox
v. Lantrip, 162 Ky. 178, 172 S.W. 133, 136; In a popular
sense, an officer is one holding a position of trust and au-
thority in any kind of an organization-civil, military, polit-
ical, ecclesiastical, or social. Illinois Commerce Commis-
sion v. Cleveland, C., C. & St. L. Ry. Co., 320 Ill. 214, 150
N.E. 678, 682. The word "officer," as used in state statutes
or constitutions, is sometimes held to refer only to elective
officers; Cunningham v. Rockwood, 222 Mass. 574, 111 N.
E. 409, 411, Ann.Cas.1917C, 1100; and sometimes to both
appointive and elective officers; State v. Campbell, 94 Ohio
St. 403, 115 N.E. 29, 31.
An "officer" is distinguished from an "employee" in the
greater importance, dignity, and independence of his posi-
tion, in requirement of oath, bond, more enduring tenure,
and fact of duties being prescribed by law. Bowden v.
Cumberland County, 123 Me. 359, 123 A. 166, 169; McClen-
don v. Board of Health of City of Hot Springs, 141 Ark.
114, 216 S.W. 289, 290; Jefferson County v. Case, 244 Ala.
56, 12 So.2d 343, 346.
In determining whether one is an "officer" or "em-
ployee," important tests are the tenure by which a position
is held, whether its duration is defined by the statute or
ordinance creating it, or whether it is temporary or
transient or for a time fixed only by agreement; whether
it is created by an appointment or election, or merely by
a contract of employment by which the rights of the par-
ties are regulated; whether the compensation is by a salary
or fees fixed by law, or by a sum agreed upon by the con-
tract of hiring. Hyde v. Board of Com'rs of Wells Coun-
ty, 209 Ind. 245, 198 N.E. 333, 337.
For obstructing an officer, see that title.
For definitions of the various classes and kinds
of officers, see the titles "Commissioned Officers,"
"Executive," "Fiscal," "Judicial," "Legislative,"
"Ministerial," "Municipal," "Naval," "Non-Com-
missioned," "Peace," "State," and "Subordinate".
Civil officer. The word "civil," as regards civil
officers, is commonly used to distinguish those
officers who are in public service but not of the
military. U. S. v. American Brewing Co., D.C.Pa.,
296 F. 772, 776; State v. Clarke, 21 Nev. 333, 31
P. 545, 18 L.R.A. 313, 37 Am.St.Rep. 517. Hence,
any officer of the United States who holds his
appointment under the national government,
whether his duties are executive or judicial, in the
highest or the lowest departments of the govern-
ment, with the exception of officers of the army
and navy, is a "civil officer." 1 Story, Const. § 792.
See, also, Com'rs v. Goldsborough, 90 Md. 193, 44
A. 1055.
Military officer. Officer who has command in
the army. Non-commissioned officer is not officer
in the sense in which that word is generally used;
Babbitt v. U. S., 16 Ct.C1. 214.
Officer de facto. As distinguished from an offi-
cer de jure; this is the designation of one who is
in the actual possession and administration of the
office, under some colorable or apparent authority,
although his title to the same, whether by election
or appointment, is in reality invalid or at least
formally questioned. Norton v. Shelby County,
6 S.Ct. 1121, 118 U.S. 425, 30 L.Ed. 78; State v.
Carroll, 38 Conn. 449, 9 Am.Rep. 409. One who
has the reputation of being the officer he assumes
to be, and yet is not a good officer in point of law.
6 East 368; City of Terre Haute v. Burns, 69 Ind.
App. 7, 116 N.E. 604, 608; Johnson v. State, 27 Ga.
App. 679, 109 S.E. 526, 527,
Official acts of officer de facto are binding on others.
McNatt v. State, 130 Tex.Cr.R. 42, 91 S.W.2d 1068, 1069.
A de facto officer is also distinguished from a "usurp-
er" who has neither lawful title nor color of right. Smith
v. City of Jefferson, 75 Or. 179, 146 P. 809, 812.
To constitute an officer de facto it is not a necessary pre-
requisite that there shall have been an attempted exercise
of competent prima facie power of appointment or elec-
tion; a de facto officer being one whose title is not good
in law, but who is in fact In the unobstructed possession
of an office and is discharging its duties in full view of the
public, in such manner and under such circumstances as
not to present the appearance of being an intruder or
usurper. U. S. v. Royer, 45 S.Ct. 519, 520, 268 U.S. 394, 69
L.Ed. 1011. A person is a "de facto officer" where the du-
ties of the officer are exercised-First, without a known ap-
pointment or election, but under such circumstances of
reputation or acquiescence as were calculated to induce
people, without inquiry, to submit to or invoke his action,
supposing him to be the officer he assumed to be. Second,
under color of a known and valid appointment or election,
but where the officer has failed to conform to some pre-

surance is made "on account of whom it may con-

idea that a case at bar is in all points similar to an-
other. The one is said to be on all fours with the
other when the facts are similar and the same

called for." In each case the debt is payable im-
mediately. Bowman v. McChesney, 22 Grat. (Va.)
609; Citizens' Bank of Waynesboro v. Mobley, 166
Ga. 543, 144 S.E. 119, 121, 58 A.L.R. 1383.

on any day between the day the cotton is placed "on call"
and the set day as the price at which the owner is entitled

v. Giles, 29 C.C.P.A. (Patents) 804, 125 F.2d 177,
As used in statutes making it an offense to carry a
weapon "on or about" the person, it is generally held that
the word "on" means connected with or attached to, and
that "about" is a comprehensive term having a broader
meaning than "on," and conveying the idea of being near
by, in close proximity, within immediate reach, or con-
veniently accessible. As applied to motor vehicles, there-
fore, it is commonly held that an occupant of the front
seat of an automobile is carrying a weapon "about" his
person where the weapon is on or under the seat, or be-
tween the cushion and the back of the seat, or on a shelf
behind the seat, or in a pocket on the door or on the back
of the seat, or in the glove compartment, or on the floor.
There are, however, a few decisions to the contrary. The
cases are collected and analyzed in Blashfield, Cyc. of Au-
tomobile Law and Prac., Perm. Ed. § 5528.90.

## ON OR BEFORE

These words, inserted in a stip-
ulation to do an act or pay money, entitle the
party stipulating to perform at any time before the
day; and upon performance, or tender and refusal,

the owner; but under other statutes, substituted service
is authorized when the automobile was being operated by

which, though lending probability to the inference, do not
evolve it by a process of absolutely necessary reasoning.
Lipscomb v. State, 75 Miss. 559, 23 So. 210.
An inference necessarily involving- certain facts may be
stated without the facts, the inference being an equivalent

then the facts must be stated. Whart.Ev. § 510.

## OPTION

In English ecclesiastical law. A custo
mary prerogative of an archbishop, when a bishop
is consecrated by him, to name a clerk or chaplain
of his own to be provided for by such suffragan
bishop; in lieu of which it is now usual for the
• bishop to make over by deed to the archbishop,
his executors and assigns, the next presentation of
such dignity or benefice in the bishop's disposal
within that see, as the archbishop himself shall
choose, which is therefore called his "option." 1
Bl.Comm. 381; 3 Steph.Comm. 63, 64; Cowell.
In contracts. A privilege existing in one per-
son, for which he has paid money, which gives
him the right to buy certain merchandise or cer-
tain specified securities from another person, if
he chooses, at any time within an agreed period,
at a fixed price, or to sell such property to such
other person at an agreed price and time. U the
option gives the choice of buying or not buying,
it is denominated a "call." If it gives the choice
of selling or not, it is called a "put." If it is a
combination of both these, and gives the privilege
of either buying or selling or not, it is called a
"straddle" or a "spread eagle." These terms are
used on the stock-exchange. Plank v. Jackson,
128 Ind. 424, 26 N.E. 568; Osgood v. Bauder, 75
Iowa, 550, 39 N.W. 887, 1 L.R.A. 655.
A continuing offer or contract by which owner stipulates
with another that latter shall have right to buy property
at fixed price within certain time, and an agreement is
only an "option" when no obligation rests on party 'to
make any payment except such as may be agreed on be-
tween parties as consideration to support option until he
has made up his mind within time specified to complete
purchase. Gibbs v. Piper, Del., 153 A. 674, 676.

resulting from acceptance thereof. Helvering v. Bartlett,

of granting an injunction, temporary or perpetual,

strain the proceedings until such determination.

privately and without being referred to the judge or court
for authorization or approval. Thus, a case which is corn-
promised, settled, and withdrawn by private agreement of
the parties, after its institution, is said to be settled "out
of court." So attorneys may make agreements with refer-
ence to the conduct of a suit or the course of proceedings
therein; but if these are made "out of court," that is,
not made in open court or with the approval of the judge,
it is a general rule that they will not be noticed by the
court unless reduced to writing. Welsh v. Blackwell, 14
N. J. Law, 345.

## OUT OF THE STATE

In reference to rights, lia-
bilities, or jurisdictions arising out of the common
law, this phrase is equivalent to "beyond sea,"

foreign corporation. Foster v. Givens, 67 F. 684,
14 C.C.A. 625; Larson v. Aultman & Taylor Co.,
80 Wis. 281, 56 N.W. 915, 39 Am.St.Rep. 893. But
a foreign corporation maintaining an agent within
the state is not deemed to be "out of the state,"
within various statutes. Hamilton v. North. Pac.
S. S. Co., 84 Or. 71, 164 P. 579, 581; American

S.W. 370, 372.

the courts, in seats specially reserved for them-
selves, and junior counsel, who sit without the bar;
and the latter are thence frequently termed bar-
risters of the "outer bar," or "utter bar," in con-
tradistinction to the former class. Brown.

## OUTER DOOR

In connection with the rule, stat-
utory or otherwise, forbidding an officer to break
open the outer door to serve civil process, this
term designates the door of each separate apart-
ment, where there are different apartments having

those who attended their persons, called "theo-
dans," or lesser thanes; the other part they allot-

Oregon-Washington R. & Nay. Co., 97 Or. 190, 191
P. 655, 656.

ity. Talbot v. Mack, 41 Nev. 245, 169 P. 25, 29..

In a resettlement, a
clause which saves the powers of sale and leasing
annexed to the estate for life created by the orig-
inal settlement, when it is desired to give the ten-
ant for life the same estate and powers under the
resettlement. The clause is so called because it
provides that the resettlement shall be overreach-
ed by the exercise of the old powers. If the reset-
tlement were executed without a provision to this
effect, the estate of the tenant for life and the an-
nexed powers would be subject to any charges for
portions, etc., created under the original settle-
ment. 3 Day.Conv. 489; Sweet.

decision, rendered by the same court or by a su-
ment upon the same question of law directly op-
posite to that which was before given, thereby
depriving the earlier opinion of all authority as a
precedent. The term is not properly applied to
conflicting decisions on the same point by co-or-
dinate or independent tribunals. It also signifies
that a majority of the judges of a court have de-
cided against the opinion of the minority, in which
case the minority judges are said to be overruled.
To refuse to sustain, or recognize as sufficient,
an objection made in the course of a trial, as to

it must be such as would naturally effect that result un-
less prevented by some extraneous cause. People v. Mills,
178 N.Y. 274, 70 N.E. 786, 67 L.R.A. 131; State v. Enanno,
96 Conn. 420, 114 A. 386, 389. It must be something done
that directly moves toward the crime, and brings the ac-
cused nearer to its commission than mere acts of prepara-
tion or of planning, and will apparently result, in the
usual and natural course of events, if not hindered by
extraneous causes, in the commission of the crime itself.
Powell v. State, 128 Miss. 107, 90 So. 625, 626; State v. Ro-
by, 194 Iowa 1032, 188 N.W. 709, 714.
In reference to the crime of treason, and the provision
of the federal constitution that a person shall not be con-
victed thereof unless on the testimony of two witnesses to
the same "overt act," the term means a step, motion, or
action really taken in the execution of a treasonable pur-
pose, as distinguished from mere words, and also from a
treasonable sentiment, design, or purpose not issuing in ac-
tion. It is an act in furtherance of the crime. U. S. v.
Fricke, D.C.N.Y., 259 F. 673, 676. One which manifests
the intention of the traitor to commit treason. Archb.
Cr.P1. 379; 4 Bla.Comm. 79; Co. 3d Inst. 12; Re Boliman,
4 Cranch, 75, 2 L.Ed. 554; U. S. v. Pryor, 3 Wash.C.C. 234,
Fed.Cas.No.16,096.
An overt act which will justify the exercise of the right
of self-defense is such as would manifest to the mind of
a reasonable person a present intention to kill him or do
him great bodily harm. Cooke v. State, 18 Ala.App. 416,
93 So. 86, 88.
An overt act which completes crime of conspiracy to vio-
late federal law is something apart from conspiracy and
is an act to effect the object of the conspiracy, and need be
neither a criminal act, nor crime that is object of con-
spiracy, but must accompany or follow agreement and must
be done in furtherance of object of agreement. Marino v.
United States, C.C.A.Cal., 91 F.2d 691, 694, 695, 113 A.L.R.

## OWELTY

Equality; an equalization charge.
Bagg v. Osborn, 169 Minn. 126, 210 N.W. 862, 863.
This word is used in law in several compound
phrases, as follows:
Owelty of exchange. A sum of money given,
when two persons have exchanged lands, by the
owner of the less valuable estate to the owner of
the more valuable, to equalize the exchange.
Owelty of partition. A sum of money paid by
one of two coparceners or co-tenants to the other,
when a partition has been effected between them,
but, the land not being susceptible of division into
exactly equal shares, such payment is required to
make the portions respectively assigned to them of
equal value. Littleton, § 251; Co. Litt. 169a; Long
v. Long, 1 Watts (Pa.) 265; 16 Viner, Abr. 223, pl.
3. Reed v. Deposit Co., 113 Pa. 578, 6 A. 163. The

Owelty of services. In the feudal law, the condi-

"acquire." State v. District Court of Third Judi-
cial Dist. in and for Granite County, 79 Mont. 1,
254 P. 863, 865.

## OWNED BY

Although these words may be used
synonymously with "belonging to" or "forming
part of"; Gilpatric v. City of Hartford, 98 Conn.
471, 120 A. 317, 319; in a stricter sense they de-
note an absolute and unqualified title, whereas the
words "belonging to" do not import that the whole
title to property or thing is meant, for a thing
may belong to one who has less than an unquali-
fied and absolute title; Baltimore Dry Docks &
Ship Building Co. v. New York & P. R. S. S. Co.,
C.C.A.Md., 262 F. 485, 488.

## OWNER

The person in whom is vested the own-
ership, dominion, or title of property; proprietor.
Garver v. Hawkeye Ins. Co., 69 Iowa 202, 28 N.W.
555; McGowan v. Morgan, 145 N.Y.S. 787, 160 App.
Div. 588; Cayce Land Co. v. Southern Ry. Co., 111
S.C. 115, 96 S.E. 725, 727; Staples v. Adams, Payne
& Gleaves, C.C.A.Va., 215 F. 322, 325. He who has

or incorporeal, which he has a right to enjoy and
do with as he pleases, even to spoil or destroy it,
as far as the law permits, unless he be prevented
by some agreement or covenant which restrains
his right. Miller-Link Lumber Co. v. Stephenson,
Tex.Civ.App., 265 S.W. 215, 220; Newborn v. Peart,
121 Misc.Rep. 221, 200 N.Y.S. 890, 892; Hare v.
Young, 26 Idaho, 682, 146 P. 104, 106; Johnson
v. Crookshanks, 21 Or. 339, 28 P. 78.
The word is not infrequently used to describe one who
has dominion or control over a thing, the title to which
is in another. Robinson v. State, 7 Ala.App. 172, 62 So.
303, 306. Thus, it may denote the buyer under a condi-
tional sale agreement; Lennon v. L. A. W. Acceptance
Corporation of Rhode Island, 48 R.I. 363, 138 A. 215, 217;

N.E. 588, 589; and a person for whose benefit a ship is
operated on a particular voyage, and who directs and con-
trols it, its officers and crew; Potter v. American Union.
Line, 185 N.Y.S. 542, 843, 114 Misc.Rep. 101 (see, also, Pe-
tition of E. I. Du Pont de Nemours & Co., D.C.N.Y., 18
F.2d 782, 784).
The term is, however, a nomen generalissimum,
and its meaning is to be gathered from the connec-
tion in which it is used, and from the subject-mat-
ter to which it is applied. Warren v. Lower Salt
Creek Drainage Dist. of Logan County, 316 Ill.
345, 147 N.E. 248, 249. The primary meaning of
the word as applied to land is one who owns the
fee and who has the right to dispose of the. prop-
erty, but the term also includes one having a pos-
sessory right to land or the person occupying or
cultivating it. Dunbar v. Texas Irr. Co., Tex.Civ.
App., 195 S.W. 614, 616; McCarthy v. Hansel, 4
Ohio App. 425; Thompson v. Thompson, 79 Or.
513, 155 P. 1190, 1191; McLevis v. St. Paul Fire &
Marine Ins. Co., 165 Minn. 468, 206 N.W. 940, 942;
Great Northern Ry. Co. v. Oakley, 135 Wash. 279,
237 P. 990, 992; In re Opinion of the Justices, 234
Mass. 597, 127 N.E. 525, 529. Sometimes it includes
a lessee; Tobin v. Gartiez, 44 Nev. 179, 191 P. 1063,
1064; but not always; Smith v. Improvement Dist.
No. 14 of Texarkana, 108 Ark. 141, 156 S.W. 455,
456, 44 L.R.A.,N.S., 696. A mortgagee may be
deemed an "owner"; Lindholm v. Hamilton, 159
Minn. 81, 198 N.W. 289, 290; Blaine County Bank
v. Noble, 55 Okl. 361, 155 P. 532, 534; Burrill Nat.
Bank v. Edminister, 119 Me. 367, 111 A. 423, 424;
Merriman v. City of New York, 227 N.Y. 279, 125
N.E. 500, 502; but under different statutes or cir-
cumstances, an opposite result may be reached;
Huebner v. Lashley, 239 Mich. 50, 214 N.W. 107,
108. The term may likewise, on occasion, include
mortgagors; Hendricks v. Town of Julesburg,
55 Colo. 59, 132 P. 61, 63; Smith v. Craver, 89
Wash. 243, 154 P. 156, 158; Borough of Princeton

Tex.Cr.R. 560, 289 S.W. 406, 407; Allen v. State,
94 Tex.Cr.R. 646, 252 S.W. 505; Carson v. State,
30 Okl.Cr. 438, 236 P. 627, 628.
In embezzlement, the principal to whom an
agent looks for authority, under whose control he
acts, and from whom he receives compensation
and takes direction, is the owner within the mean-
ing of statute. Coney v. State, 100 Tex.Cr.R. 380,
272 S.W. 197, 199.
Equitable owner. One who is recognized in
equity as the owner of property, because the real
and beneficial use and title belong to him, although
the bare legal title is vested in another, e. g., a
trustee for his benefit. One who has a present
title in land which will ripen into legal ownership
upon the performance of conditions subsequent.
Hawkins v. Stiles, Tex.Civ.App., 158 S.W. 1011,
1021. There may therefore be two "owners" in
respect of the same property, one the nominal or
legal owner, the other the beneficial or equitable
owner. In re Fulham's Estate, 96 Vt. 308, 119 A.
433, 437.
General owner. He who has the primary or re-
siduary title to it; as distinguished from a special
owner, who has a special interest in the same
thing, amounting to a qualified ownership, such,
for example, as a bailee's lien. Farmers' & Mech-
anics' Nat. Bank v. Logan, 74 N.Y. 581. One who
has both the right of property and of possession.
General and beneficial owner. The person
whose interest is primarily one of possession and
enjoyment in contemplation of an ultimate abso-
lute ownership;—not the person whose interest is
primarily in the enforcement of a collateral pecu-
niary claim, and does not contemplate the use or
enjoyment of the property as such. Ex parte
State, 206 Ala. 575, 90 So. 896.
Joint owners. Two or more persons who joint-
ly own and hold title to property, e. g., joint ten-
ants, and also partners and tenants in common.
In re Huggins' Estate, 96 N.J.Eq. 275, 125 A. 27,
30. In its most comprehensive sense, the term
embraces all cases where the property in question
is owned by two or more persons regardless of
the special nature of their relationship or how it
came into being. Halferty v. Karr, 188 Mo.App.
241, 175 S W. 146, 147.
An estate by entirety is a "joint ownership" of a hus-
band and wife as at common law notwithstanding legisla-
tive enactments touching joint tenancy. Cullum v. Rice,
236 Mo.App. 1113, 162 S.W.2d 342, 344.
Legal owner. One who is recognized and held
responsible by the law as the owner of property.
In a more particular sense, one in whom the legal
title to real estate is vested, but who holds it in
trust for the benefit of another, the latter being
called the "equitable" owner.
Part owners. Joint owners; co-owners; those
who have shares of ownership in the same thing,
particularly a vessel.
Real owners. Those who must be joined in ac-
tions of scire facias sur mortgage under Pennsyl-
vania statutes are the present owners of the title
under which the mortgagor claimed when he exe-
cuted the mortgages, and do not include persons
claiming by titles antagonistic to the mortgagor.
Orient Building & Loan Ass'n v. Gould, 239 Pa.
335, 86 A. 863.
Record owner. This term, particularly used in
statutes requiring notice of tax delinquency or
sale, means the owner of record, not the owner
described in the tax roll; Okanogan Power & Irri-
gation Co. v. Quackenbush, 107 Wash. 651, 182 P.
618, 619, 5 A.L.R. 966; the owner of the title at
time of notice; Hunt v. State, 110 Tex. 204, 217 S.
W. 1034, 1035.
Reputed owner. One who has to all appearances
from all appearances, or from supposition, is the
owner of a thing. Lowell Hardware Co. v. May,
59 Colo. 475, 149 P. 831, 832. He who has the
general credit or reputation of being the owner or
proprietor of goods. Santa Cruz Rock Pay. Co. v.
Lyons, 5 Cal.Unrep.Cas. 260, 43 P. 601.
This phrase is chiefly used in English bankruptcy prac-
tice, where the bankrupt is styled the "reputed owner"
of goods lawfully in his possession, though the real owner
may be another person. The word "reputed" has a much
weaker sense than its derivation would appear to warrant;
importing merely a supposition or opinion derived or made
up from outward appearances, and often unsupported by
fact. The term "reputed owner" is frequently employed in
this sense. 2 Steph.Comm. 206,
Riparian owner. See Riparian.
Sole and unconditional owner. An expression
commonly used in fire insurance policies, in which
the word "sole" means that no one else has any
interest in the property as owner, and "uncondi-
tional" means that the quality of the estate is not
limited or affected by any condition. Globe &
Rutgers Fire Ins. Co. v. Creekmore, 69 Okl. 238,
171 P. 874, 876; Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. McCain,
141 Miss. 394, 106 So. 529. To be "unconditional
and sole," the interest or ownership of the insured
must be completely vested, not contingent or con-
ditional, nor in common or jointly with others, but
of such nature that the insured must alone sustain
the entire loss if the property is destroyed; and
this is so whether the title is legal or equitable.
Socicero v. National Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pitts-
burgh, Pa., 90 Fla. 820, 106 So. 879; Livingstone v.
Boston Ins. Co., 255 Pa. 1, 99 A. 212, 213.
It is sufficient to satisfy the requirements of "sole and
unconditional ownership" that the insured is the sole
equitable owner and has the full equitable title. Turner
v. Home Ins. Co., 195 Mo.App. 138, 189 S.W. 626, 628; Al-
liance Ins. Co. v. Enders, C.C.A.Idaho, 293 F. 485, 489. It
is enough that the insured is equitably entitled to im-
mediate and absolute legal ownership. Exchange Under-
writers' Agency of Royal Exchange Assur. of London,
England, v. Bates, 195 Ala. 161, 69 So. 956, 960. The term
contemplates beneficial and practical proprietorship and
not necessarily technical title. Royal Ins. Co. v. Drury,
150 Md. 211, 132 A. 635, 640, 43 A.L.R. 582. See Giles v.
Citizens' Ins. Co. of Missouri, 32 Ga.App. 207, 122 S.E. 890,
Special owner. One who has a special interest in
an article of property, amounting to a qualified
ownership of it, such, for example, as a bailee's
lien; as distinguished from the general owner,
who has the primary or residuary title to the
same thing. Frazier v. State, 18 Tex.App. 441.
Some person holding property with the consent
of, and as representative of, the actual owner.
Mathieu v. Roberts, 31 N.M. 469, 247 P. 1066, 1068.

## OWNER'S RISK

An expression employed by
carriers with the object of relieving them from re-
sponsibility. See [1906] T. S. 973 (So. Afr.) ; Heis-
kell v. Furness, Withy & Co., C.C.A.N.Y., 4 F.2d
977, 978.

## OWNERSHIP

Collection of rights to use and en-
joy property, including right to transmit it to oth-
ers. Trustees of Phillips Exeter Academy v. Exe-
ter, 92 N.H. 473, 33 A.2d 665, 673. The complete
claim. The entirety of the powers of use and dis-
posal allowed by law. See Property.
The right of one or more persons to possess and use a
thing to the exclusion of others. Civ. Code Cal. § 654.
The right by which a thing belongs to some one in particu-
lar, to the exclusion of all other persons. Civ. Code La.
art. 488. The exclusive right of possession, enjoyment, and
disposal; Thompson v. Kreutzer, 112 Miss. 165, 72 So. 891;
involving as an essential attribute the right to control,
handle, and dispose; Hardinge v. Empire Zinc Co., 17 Ariz.
75, 148 P. 306, 310.
Ownership is divided into perfect and imperfect. Owner-
ship is perfect when it is perpetual, and when the thing
is unincumbered with any real right towards any other per-
son than the owner. On the contrary, ownership is im-
perfect when it is to terminate at a certain time or on a
condition, or if the thing which is the object of it, being an
immovable, is charged with any real right towards a third
person; as a usufruct, use, or servitude. When an im-
movable is subject to a usufruct, the owner of it is said
to possess the naked ownership. Civ.Code La. art. 490;
Maestri v. Board of Assessors, 110 La. 517, 34 So. 658.
In criminal law. In connection with burglary,
"ownership" means any possession which is right-
ful as against the burglar. Seaba v. State, 33 Okl.
Cr. 59, 242 P. 779, 780; State v. Bige, 195 Iowa,
1342, 193 N.W. 17, 21. It is synonymous with oc-
cupancy. State v. Harrison, Mo.Sup., 285 S.W. 83,
87; Carneal v. State, 86 Tex.Cr.R. 274, 216 S.W.
626. When considered as an element of larceny,
"ownership" means the same as "possession."
People v. Edwards, 72 Cal.App. 102, 236 P. 944,
Exclusive ownership. See Exclusive Ownership.

## OXFILD

A restitution anciently made by a hun-
dred or county for any wrong done by one that
was within the same. Lamb.Arch. 125.

## OXGANG

In old English law. As much land
as an ox could till. Co. Litt. 5a. A measure
of land of uncertain quantity. In the north of
England a division of a carucate. According to
some, fifteen acres. Co. Litt. 69a; Crompton,
Jurisd. 220. According to Balfour, the Scotch
oxengang, or oxgate, contained twelve acres; but
this does not correspond with ancient charters.
Bell, Dict. Ploughgate. Skene and Spelman say
thirteen acres. Cowell; 1 Poll. & Maitl. 347.
See Librata Terrae.

## OYER

In Old Practice. Hearing; the hearing
a deed read, which a party sued on a bond, etc.,
might pray or demand, and it was then read to
him by the other party; the entry on the record
being, "et ei legitur in hcec verba," (and it is read
to him in these words). Steph. Pl. 67, 68; 3 Bl.
Comm. 299; 3 Salk. 119.
In Modern practice. A copy of a bond or spe-
cialty sued upon, given to the opposite party, in
lieu of the old practice of reading it.

## OYER AND TERMINER

A half French phrase
applied in England to the assizes, which are so
called from the commission of oyer and terminer
directed to the judges, empowering them to "in-
quire, hear, and determine" all treasons, felonies,
and misdemeanors. This commission is now is-
sued regularly, but was formerly used only on par-
ticular occasions, as upon sudden outrage or in-
surrection in any place. In the United States, the
higher criminal courts are called "courts of oyer
and terminer." Burrill.

## OYER DE RECORD

A petition made in court
that the judges, for better proof's sake, will hear
or look upon any record. Cowell.

## OYEZ

Hear ye. A word used in courts by the
public crier to command attention when a proc-
lamation is about to be made. Usually pronounc-
ed "0 yes." 4 Bla.Comm. 340, n.
