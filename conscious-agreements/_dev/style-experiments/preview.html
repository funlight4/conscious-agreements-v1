                    <p>When you signed that mortgage, you created a <strong>promissory note</strong> — an IOU worth $300,000. The bank didn't give you their money. They took YOUR note, deposited it as an asset, and gave you back... credit based on your own promise. You paid. They just forgot to tell you.</p>

                    <p>Understanding agreements isn't about declaring yourself "sovereign" or claiming laws don't apply. It's about <strong>conscious participation</strong> — knowing what game you're in, what rules you're playing by, and what choices you actually have. Education, not confrontation.</p>

            <!-- TYPOGRAPHY SAMPLES -->
            <section>
                <h2>How We Talk About This</h2>
                <p>We're not here to scare you or make you angry. This isn't about "evil banks" or conspiracy theories. It's about understanding a system that operates on <strong>specific definitions</strong> and <strong>precise procedures</strong> that most people never learn.</p>

                <h3>The Simple Version</h3>
                <p>Imagine signing up for a gym membership while sleepwalking. You wake up, you're being charged monthly, and when you complain, they show you your signature. "But I didn't know what I was signing!" you say. "Ignorance is no excuse," they reply.</p>
                <p>That's basically how the legal system works. Except instead of a gym, it's citizenship, contracts, and debt. And instead of sleepwalking, it's just... never being taught the rules.</p>

                <h4>What We'll Explore Together</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Containers</strong> — Every "game" has boundaries. Step inside, rules apply. Stay outside, they don't.</li>
                    <li><strong>Agreements</strong> — You're in more than you know. Let's find them.</li>
                    <li><strong>Consideration</strong> — The secret ingredient every contract needs. (Spoiler: most don't have it.)</li>
                    <li><strong>Your Signature</strong> — More powerful than you imagined. Let's learn to use it consciously.</li>
                </ul>

                <ol>
                    <li>First, we discover the games</li>
                    <li>Then, we learn the rules</li>
                    <li>Finally, we make real choices</li>
                </ol>
