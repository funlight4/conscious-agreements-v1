                    <p>As explored in <a href="/foundation/money-creation/">Money Creation</a>, modern banks don't lend existing money — they create deposits when you sign a promissory note. This raises the consideration question:</p>

                    <h2>Historical Case Law</h2>

                    <p>Classical contract law is clear about what constitutes consideration:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        "Nothing is consideration that is not regarded as such by both parties."
                        <cite>— Philpot v. Gruninger, 14 Wall. 570 (1872)</cite>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Did you understand that the bank would create money from your signature? Did you regard bookkeeping entries as equivalent value to your 30-year commitment of labor?</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        "Consideration must be something of value in the eye of the law, moving from the plaintiff, or detriment to the defendant."
                        <cite>— Black's Law Dictionary, 4th Edition</cite>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>What "moved from" the bank that wasn't derived from what you gave them?</p>

                    <h2>The Credit River Decision</h2>

                    <p>One court directly addressed this question:</p>

                    <div class="insight-box">
                        <div class="insight-box__title">First National Bank of Montgomery v. Daly (1969)</div>
                        <p>Justice Martin V. Mahoney ruled that the bank had failed to provide consideration because they created credit "out of thin air."</p>
                        <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                            <li>The bank admitted creating credit from nothing</li>
                            <li>No lawful money was transferred from the bank</li>
                            <li>The mortgage contract was void for lack of consideration</li>
                            <li>The foreclosure was denied</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <p>The bank's president testified: <em>"The money and credit first came into existence when they created it."</em></p>

                    <div class="important-box">
                        <div class="important-box__title">Important Caveat</div>
                        <p>This decision was not accepted as binding precedent and was largely suppressed. Courts since have declined to follow it. But it demonstrates that the consideration question <strong>has been raised</strong> — and in at least one case, was decided in favor of the borrower.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>Why Courts Resist This Argument</h2>

                    <p>Several legal doctrines make the consideration argument difficult to win:</p>

                    <div class="card card--highlight">
                        <div class="card__label">Barrier 1</div>
                        <div class="card__title">Holder in Due Course Doctrine</div>
                        <p class="card__text">If the bank qualifies as HDC, lack of consideration becomes a "personal defense" that may be cut off. HDC status immunizes against most consideration challenges.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="card card--highlight">
                        <div class="card__label">Barrier 2</div>
                        <div class="card__title">Judicial Notice</div>
                        <p class="card__text">Courts take "judicial notice" that banks lend money and that Federal Reserve Notes are valid currency. Challenging these assumptions is often dismissed as frivolous without examination.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="card card--highlight">
                        <div class="card__label">Barrier 3</div>
                        <div class="card__title">Legal Tender Laws</div>
                        <p class="card__text">31 U.S.C. § 5103 declares Federal Reserve Notes legal tender. Courts interpret this as making FRNs valid consideration by statute, regardless of how they're created.</p>

                    <div class="card card--highlight">

                        <p>The consideration argument provides <strong>understanding</strong>. Practical success often comes through other routes — procedural challenges, statutory violations, standing issues. But understanding consideration helps you see the full picture and choose your approach wisely.</p>

                    <h2>The Fraud Connection</h2>

                    <p>Related to consideration is the fraud defense under UCC Article 3:</p>

                    <div class="definition-box">
                        <div class="definition-box__term">Fraud Defense</div>
                        <div class="definition-box__source">UCC § 3-305(a)(1)(iii)</div>
                        <div class="definition-box__meaning">A defense is valid against enforcement if based on: "fraud that induced the obligor to sign the instrument with neither knowledge nor reasonable opportunity to learn of its character or its essential terms."</div>
                    </div>

                    <p>Were you told that:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Your signature would create the money?</li>
                        <li>The bank would use your promissory note as an asset?</li>
                        <li>You were providing the consideration for both sides?</li>
                        <li>The "loan" was actually monetization of your promise?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>If not, and if you had no reasonable opportunity to learn this, UCC 3-305 may provide a defense.</p>
