                    <p>As explored in <a href="/foundation/money-creation/">Money Creation</a>, modern banks don't lend existing money — they create deposits when you sign a promissory note. This raises the consideration question:</p>

                    <h2>Historical Case Law</h2>

                    <p>Classical contract law is clear about what constitutes consideration:</p>

                    <blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid var(--color-gold); padding-left: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; font-style: italic;">
                        "Nothing is consideration that is not regarded as such by both parties."
                        <cite style="display: block; margin-top: 0.5rem; font-style: normal; font-size: 0.9rem;">— Philpot v. Gruninger, 14 Wall. 570 (1872)</cite>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Did you understand that the bank would create money from your signature? Did you regard bookkeeping entries as equivalent value to your 30-year commitment of labor?</p>

                    <blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid var(--color-gold); padding-left: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; font-style: italic;">

                    <h2>The Credit River Decision</h2>

                    <p>One court directly addressed this question:</p>

                    <p><strong>First National Bank of Montgomery v. Daly (1969)</strong></p>

                    <p>Justice Martin V. Mahoney ruled that the bank had failed to provide consideration because they created credit "out of thin air." Key findings:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The bank admitted creating credit from nothing</li>
                        <li>No lawful money was transferred from the bank</li>
                        <li>The mortgage contract was void for lack of consideration</li>
                        <li>The foreclosure was denied</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The bank's president testified: "The money and credit first came into existence when they created it."</p>

                    <p><strong>Important caveat:</strong> This decision was not accepted as binding precedent and was largely suppressed. Courts since have declined to follow it. But it demonstrates that the consideration question has been raised — and in at least one case, was decided in favor of the borrower.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>Why Courts Resist This Argument</h2>

                    <p>Several legal doctrines make the consideration argument difficult to win:</p>

                    <div class="card" style="margin: 1.5rem 0;">
                        <div class="card__title">Holder in Due Course Doctrine</div>
                        <p>If the bank (or subsequent holder) qualifies as a holder in due course, lack of consideration is a "personal defense" that may be cut off. HDC status immunizes against most consideration challenges.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="card" style="margin: 1.5rem 0;">
                        <div class="card__title">Judicial Notice</div>
                        <p>Courts take "judicial notice" that banks lend money and that Federal Reserve Notes are valid currency. Challenging these assumptions is often dismissed as frivolous without examination.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="card" style="margin: 1.5rem 0;">
                        <div class="card__title">Legal Tender Laws</div>
                        <p>31 U.S.C. § 5103 declares Federal Reserve Notes legal tender for all debts. Courts interpret this as making FRNs valid consideration by statute, regardless of how they're created.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="card" style="margin: 1.5rem 0;">
                        <div class="card__title">Systemic Concerns</div>
                        <p>Even sympathetic judges face the reality that accepting this argument would destabilize the entire banking system. Pragmatic concerns often override legal principles.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Practical Application</h2>

                    <p>While direct consideration challenges rarely succeed in court, understanding this framework is valuable:</p>

                    <h3>For Awareness</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You understand what actually happened when you signed</li>
                        <li>You see the transaction clearly rather than through assumptions</li>
                        <li>You can make more informed decisions about future agreements</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>For Negotiation</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Knowledge creates leverage in settlement discussions</li>
                        <li>Banks may prefer to settle rather than have these arguments on record</li>
                        <li>Loan modifications become more understandable negotiations</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>For Other Challenges</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Standing challenges (who can enforce?)</li>
                        <li>Chain of title challenges (proper endorsements?)</li>
                        <li>Procedural violations (TILA, RESPA, FDCPA)</li>
                        <li>Fraud in the inducement (were you deceived?)</li>
                    </ul>

                        <p>The consideration argument provides understanding. Practical success often comes through other routes — procedural challenges, statutory violations, standing issues. But understanding consideration helps you see the full picture and choose your approach wisely.</p>

                    <h2>The Fraud Connection</h2>

                    <p>Related to consideration is the fraud defense under UCC Article 3:</p>

                    <div class="statute-box">
                        <div class="statute-box__cite">UCC § 3-305(a)(1)(iii)</div>
                        <div class="statute-box__text">
                            A defense is valid against enforcement if based on: "fraud that induced the obligor to sign the instrument with <em>neither knowledge nor reasonable opportunity to learn</em> of its character or its essential terms."
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>Were you told that:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your signature would create the money?</li>
                        <li>The bank would use your promissory note as an asset?</li>
                        <li>You were providing the consideration for both sides?</li>
                        <li>The "loan" was actually monetization of your promise?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>If not, and if you had no reasonable opportunity to learn this, UCC 3-305 may provide a defense.</p>

                    <h2>Next: Protecting Yourself</h2>

                    <p>Understanding consideration is foundational. The next question is: <strong>How do you sign documents to limit your liability?</strong> The way you sign determines what obligations you assume.</p>
