                    <h1>Person and Individual</h1>
                    <p class="lead">In everyday speech, "person" means a human being. In legal documents, it often means something quite different. Understanding these definitions is the first step to understanding identity in law.</p>
                </header>

                <section>
                    <h2>Why Definitions Matter</h2>

                    <p>Law operates on <strong>definitions</strong>. The same word can have completely different meanings in legal contexts versus common speech. If you read a statute using common meanings, you may completely misunderstand who it applies to.</p>

                    <blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid var(--color-gold); padding-left: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; font-style: italic;">
                        "Definition" means "the meaning or limit/bounds of meaning of a word, term, phrase, etc."
                        <cite style="display: block; margin-top: 0.5rem; font-style: normal; font-size: 0.9rem;">— Online Etymology Dictionary</cite>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Anything without clear boundaries is NOT a definition — it's ambiguity. Legal documents exploit this ambiguity when terms are left undefined or when definitions differ from common understanding.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>The Definition of "Person"</h2>

                    <p>In common speech: "person" = human being.</p>

                    <p>In federal law:</p>

                    <div class="statute-box">
                        <div class="statute-box__cite">26 U.S.C. § 7701(a)(1) — Definitions</div>
                        <div class="statute-box__text">
                            "The term 'person' shall be construed to mean and include an <em>individual</em>, a <em>trust</em>, <em>estate</em>, <em>partnership</em>, <em>association</em>, <em>company</em> or <em>corporation</em>."
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>"Person" includes entities that are clearly not human beings — trusts, corporations, partnerships. When a statute applies to "persons," it may be addressing entities, not just living people.</p>

                    <div class="statute-box">
                        <div class="statute-box__cite">1 U.S.C. § 8 — "Person" Defined</div>

                            "In determining the meaning of any Act of Congress... the words 'person' and 'whoever' include <em>corporations, companies, associations, firms, partnerships, societies, and joint stock companies</em>, as well as individuals."
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>The Definition of "Individual"</h2>

                    <p>You might think "individual" clearly means a human being. But trace the definition:</p>

                    <p>In the Internal Revenue Code, "person" includes "individual." But what is an "individual"?</p>

                    <div class="insight-box">
                        <div class="insight-box__title">The Definitional Chain</div>
                        <p>Some research suggests that in certain contexts, "individual" means "individual proprietorship" — which is another term for "sole proprietorship." A sole proprietorship is a <strong>business entity</strong>, not a living human being.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>If this interpretation is correct:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"Person" includes "individual"</li>
                        <li>"Individual" means "individual proprietorship"</li>
                        <li>"Individual proprietorship" is a business entity</li>
                        <li>Therefore: "Person" refers to entities, not living humans</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="important-box">
                        <div class="important-box__title">Verification Required</div>
                        <p>This interpretation is contested. Some courts accept versions of this argument; many reject it. The point is not to assert this as proven fact, but to recognize that definitions in legal documents may not match common understanding — and you should verify rather than assume.</p>
                    </div>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Case Law on "Person"</h2>

                    <div class="statute-box">
                        <div class="statute-box__cite">United States v. Cooper Corp., 312 U.S. 600 (1941)</div>
                        <div class="statute-box__text">
                            "The term 'person' does <em>not include the sovereign</em>... Since in common usage the term 'person' does not include the sovereign, statutes employing the phrase are ordinarily construed to exclude it."
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>The Supreme Court acknowledged that "person" has a specific legal meaning that may differ from common usage — and specifically, that the sovereign (the government, or arguably the free individual) is excluded from the term.</p>

                    <p>If you are the sovereign (in the sense of a free individual not subject to a particular statute), you might not be a "person" under that statute.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>The Social Security Number Connection</h2>

                    <p>One theory connects the "individual" definition to the Social Security Number:</p>

                    <div class="card" style="margin: 1.5rem 0;">
                        <div class="card__title">The SSN Theory</div>
                        <p>Looking at the SS-4 form (Application for Employer Identification Number), the Social Security Number functions as an EIN — an Employer Identification Number for the "individual proprietorship" that is YOUR NAME.</p>
                        <p style="margin-top: 0.5rem;"><strong>If true:</strong></p>
                        <ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 0; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
                            <li>Your SSN identifies a business entity, not you personally</li>
                            <li>The entity is the "individual" / sole proprietorship</li>
                            <li>You (the living person) are not the entity — you may be its operator</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <p>This theory suggests a separation between you (the living being) and the legal entity identified by the SSN. The entity can enter contracts, have obligations, and be taxed. You operate that entity but may not be identical to it.</p>

                    <h2>Practical Implications</h2>

                    <h3>When Reading Documents</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Check definitions</strong> — Most legal documents have a definitions section</li>
                        <li><strong>Don't assume common meanings</strong> — Legal terms may differ dramatically</li>
                        <li><strong>Ask who it addresses</strong> — Is it addressing you, or an entity bearing your name?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>When Entering Agreements</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Clarify your capacity</strong> — Are you acting personally or as representative?</li>
                        <li><strong>Question the terms</strong> — What do they mean by "person," "individual," etc.?</li>
                        <li><strong>Document your understanding</strong> — Put clarifications in writing</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Connection to Signatures</h3>
                    <p>How you sign relates to who is obligated. See <a href="/domains/commerce/signatures-and-liability.html">Signatures and Liability</a> for how to sign in representative capacity — potentially separating your personal liability from the legal entity.</p>
