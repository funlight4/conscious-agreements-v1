                    <h2>Why Identity Matters</h2>

                    <p>Agreements require parties. Before you can be bound by an agreement, there must be clarity about who "you" are in that agreement. The legal system has specific definitions that may differ from common understanding:</p>

                    <div class="grid grid--2">
                        <div class="card">
                            <div class="card__title">"Person"</div>
                            <p class="card__text">Often includes corporations and entities, not just humans. When a statute applies to "persons," you may not be included — or may be.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="card">
                            <div class="card__title">"Individual"</div>
                            <p class="card__text">In some contexts, means a type of business entity — "individual proprietorship." Not necessarily a human being.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="card">
                            <div class="card__title">Your Name</div>
                            <p class="card__text">May refer to a legal entity separate from you. ALL CAPS vs. upper/lowercase — does the format matter?</p>
                        </div>

                            <p class="card__text">Determines which jurisdiction's laws apply. Federal citizen vs. state citizen — two different statuses.</p>

                        <p>The identity framework presented here includes theories that have had mixed reception in courts. Some judges accept aspects of these arguments; many dismiss them as "sovereign citizen" theories.</p>
                        <p style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">The value is in <strong>understanding</strong> — seeing how the system defines and addresses you — rather than assuming these concepts will automatically succeed as legal defenses.</p>
