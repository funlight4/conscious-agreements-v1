                    <p class="lead">This is the part that blows minds. Not because it's complicated — because it's simple. So simple that once you see it, you can't unsee it. And it changes everything about how you view debt.</p>

                        <div class="insight-box__title">The One-Sentence Truth</div>
                        <p>When you sign a promissory note for a loan, you're not borrowing pre-existing money. <strong>Your signature creates the money.</strong> The bank converts your promise into spendable currency — then claims you owe them for your own creation.</p>
                    </div>

                    <blockquote>
                        "Commercial banks create money, in the form of bank deposits, by making new loans. When a bank makes a loan... it does not typically do so by giving them thousands of pounds worth of banknotes. Instead, it credits their bank account with a bank deposit of the size of the mortgage. At that moment, new money is created."
                        <cite>— Bank of England, "Money Creation in the Modern Economy" (2014)</cite>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>This isn't conspiracy theory. It's documented in Federal Reserve publications, banking textbooks, and federal statutes. It's hiding in plain sight.</p>

                    <h2>Why This Matters for Your Agreements</h2>

                    <p>This isn't abstract economics. It directly affects the agreements you're in:</p>

                            <p class="card__text">If your signature created the $300,000, why do you "owe" it? You gave them a $300,000 instrument. They gave you... access to it.</p>

                        <div class="card">

                            <p class="card__text">Each swipe creates new money through your promise. You're not "using their credit" — you're creating credit through your signature.</p>

                    <h2>The Consideration Question</h2>

                    <p>Valid contracts require <strong>consideration from both parties</strong>. You provide your promise (real consideration). But what does the bank provide?</p>

                        <div class="important-box__title">The Million Dollar Question</div>
                        <p>If the bank simply converts YOUR promise into spendable form, where is THEIR consideration? What did they actually give up to create a binding contract?</p>
                        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">This question has been raised in courts, largely unsuccessfully — but understanding it gives you a completely different lens on what "debt" actually is.</p>
