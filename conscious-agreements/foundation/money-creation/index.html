                    <div class="insight-box__title">The Key Insight</div>
                    <p>When you sign a promissory note for a loan, you're not borrowing pre-existing money. <strong>Your signature creates the money.</strong> The bank converts your promise into spendable currency — then claims you owe them for your own creation.</p>
                </div>

                <p>This isn't conspiracy theory. It's documented in Federal Reserve publications, banking textbooks, and federal statutes. The Bank of England openly states: <em>"Commercial banks create money, in the form of bank deposits, by making new loans."</em></p>

                <p>Understanding this changes everything about how you view debt, mortgages, and the <a href="/reference/terminology.html#consideration">consideration</a> question in banking agreements.</p>

                <h2>Why This Matters</h2>

                <p>This isn't abstract economics. It directly affects the agreements you're in:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Mortgages</strong> — If your signature created the $300,000, why do you "owe" it?</li>
                    <li><strong>Credit Cards</strong> — Each swipe creates new money through your promise</li>
                    <li><strong>Car Loans</strong> — Same principle, smaller scale</li>
                    <li><strong>Student Loans</strong> — Your future labor, monetized before you begin</li>
                </ul>

                <p>In each case, the traditional story says: "The bank has money, they lend it to you, you pay it back." But the documented reality is: "You create a promise, the bank monetizes it, then claims you owe them."</p>

                <div class="important-box">
                    <div class="important-box__title">The Consideration Question</div>
                    <p>Valid contracts require consideration from <strong>both parties</strong>. You provide your promise (real consideration). But what does the bank provide? If they simply convert YOUR promise into spendable form, where is THEIR consideration?</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">This question has been raised in courts, largely unsuccessfully — but understanding it gives you a different lens on what "debt" actually is.</p>
