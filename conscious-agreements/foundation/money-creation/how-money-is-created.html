                    <h1>How Money Is Created</h1>
                    <p class="lead">What you think you know about banks and loans is almost certainly wrong. Understanding what actually happens when you get a loan changes everything.</p>
                </header>

                <section>
                    <h2>What You Probably Believe</h2>

                    <p>Most people think the banking system works like this:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Banks have money (from deposits or reserves)</li>
                        <li>When you need a loan, they lend you some of that money</li>
                        <li>You pay it back with interest</li>
                        <li>The money returns to the bank</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>This seems logical. It's what we're taught. It's what most people assume.</p>

                    <p><strong>It's also completely wrong.</strong></p>
                </section>

                    <h2>A Simple Question</h2>

                    <p>Imagine you want to buy a house for $300,000. You go to the bank for a mortgage.</p>

                    <p><strong>Question:</strong> Where does the bank get that $300,000 to give you?</p>

                                <li>From the bank's own money?</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        <div class="comparison-box__right">

                            <p style="margin: 0;">The $300,000 is <strong>created from your signature</strong> on a piece of paper called a promissory note.</p>

                            <p>You sign a promissory note — your written promise to pay $300,000 plus interest over 30 years. This is a <a href="/reference/terminology.html#negotiable-instrument">negotiable instrument</a> with real legal value.</p>

                            <p>Your promissory note is worth $300,000 (because you promised to pay that). The bank records it as an <strong>asset</strong> on their books — just like they would deposit a check.</p>

                    <h2>This Is Not Disputed</h2>

                    <p>This isn't a fringe theory. It's documented by the institutions themselves:</p>

                    <blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid var(--color-gold); padding-left: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; font-style: italic;">
                        "Commercial banks create money, in the form of bank deposits, by making new loans. When a bank makes a loan, for example to someone taking out a mortgage to buy a house, it does not typically do so by giving them thousands of pounds worth of banknotes. Instead, it credits their bank account with a bank deposit of the size of the mortgage. At that moment, new money is created."
                        <cite style="display: block; margin-top: 0.5rem; font-style: normal; font-size: 0.9rem;">— Bank of England, "Money Creation in the Modern Economy" (2014)</cite>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>The Federal Reserve, Bank of England, and standard banking textbooks all acknowledge this. The truth is hiding in plain sight — it's just not widely understood.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>What About Federal Reserve Notes?</h2>

                    <p>Look at a dollar bill. It says "Federal Reserve Note" at the top.</p>

                    <p>A "note" is a promise to pay. Federal Reserve Notes are just <strong>standardized, transferable versions</strong> of promises to pay — originally based on promissory notes like the one you signed for your mortgage.</p>

                    <h3>The Historical Arc</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Before 1933:</strong> Federal Reserve Notes were redeemable for gold</li>
                        <li><strong>1933-1971:</strong> Only foreign governments could redeem for gold</li>
                        <li><strong>After 1971:</strong> Federal Reserve Notes are backed by... promises to pay</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Today, all money is essentially someone's promise to pay. Your promissory note is the same type of instrument as a Federal Reserve Note — just not yet standardized for circulation.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>The Credit Card Connection</h2>

                    <p>This happens in miniature every day:</p>

                    <h3>When You Use a Credit Card:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>You create a new promise to pay</li>
                        <li>The merchant gets paid immediately</li>
                        <li>New money enters the economy</li>
                        <li>You've literally created money with your signature (or chip/tap)</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>When You Use a Debit Card:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>You use money that already exists (from previous promises)</li>
                        <li>No new money is created</li>
                        <li>You're just transferring existing promises</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p><em>This is why banks push credit cards so aggressively — every swipe creates new money and new debt.</em></p>

                <section>
                    <h2>The Mathematical Problem</h2>

                    <p>Here's where it gets concerning:</p>

                    <div class="math-example">
                        <div class="math-example__title">A Simple Loan</div>
                        <p>You borrow $300,000 at 5% interest for 30 years:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Money created by your signature: <strong>$300,000</strong></li>
                            <li>Total you'll pay back: <strong>~$580,000</strong></li>
                            <li>Extra needed for interest: <strong>$280,000</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Question:</strong> Where does the extra $280,000 come from?</p>
                    </div>

                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> It can ONLY come from other people creating new promises (new loans).</p>

                    <div class="math-example">
                        <div class="math-example__title">Island Economy Example</div>
                        <pre style="margin: 0; white-space: pre-wrap;">
Day 1: Empty island, no money exists

Person A borrows $1,000 at 10% interest (creates $1,000)
Person B borrows $1,000 at 10% interest (creates $1,000)
Person C borrows $1,000 at 10% interest (creates $1,000)

Total money created: $3,000
Total money owed: $3,300 (including interest)

Problem: There's only $3,000 but $3,300 is owed!
                        </pre>
                    </div>

                    <p>Someone MUST borrow more money (create new promises) or someone MUST default. There is no other option. This is not theory — it's arithmetic.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The system <strong>requires constant growth</strong> — new loans to pay interest on old loans</li>
                        <li>Inflation is guaranteed — more money must enter circulation</li>
                        <li>Total debt can never be paid off — there isn't enough money</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Your signature has immense power — it literally creates money</li>
                        <li>You're not "borrowing" from the bank — you're creating through them</li>
                        <li>The <a href="/reference/terminology.html#consideration">consideration</a> question becomes acute: what did the bank actually provide?</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Verify This Yourself</h2>

                    <h3>Ask Your Bank</h3>
                    <p>"When I got my mortgage, which account did the $300,000 come from?"</p>
                    <p><em>(They can't answer — because it didn't come from any account.)</em></p>

                    <h3>Read the Statute</h3>
                    <p><strong>12 U.S.C. § 411</strong> still says Federal Reserve Notes must be "redeemed in lawful money on demand." If Federal Reserve Notes ARE money, what is "lawful money"?</p>
