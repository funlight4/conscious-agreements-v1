                    <p class="lead">Most people think banks work like this:</p>

                    <div class="card">
                        <div class="card__title">The Story We're Told</div>

                            <li>Banks have money (from deposits or reserves)</li>
                            <li>When you need a loan, they lend you some of that money</li>
                            <li>You pay it back with interest</li>
                            <li>The money returns to the bank</li>
                        </ol>

                    <p>This seems logical. It's what we're taught. It's what most people assume.</p>

                    <p><strong>It's also completely wrong.</strong></p>

                    <h2>A Simple Question</h2>

                    <p>You want to buy a house for $300,000. You go to the bank for a mortgage.</p>

                    <p><strong>Question:</strong> Where does the bank get that $300,000 to give you?</p>

                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>This sounds impossible. Let's walk through exactly what happens.</p>

                        <p class="card__text">You sign a promissory note — your written promise to pay $300,000 plus interest over 30 years. This is a negotiable instrument with real legal value.</p>

                    <h2>This Is Not Disputed</h2>

                    <p>This isn't a fringe theory. It's documented by the institutions themselves:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        "Commercial banks create money, in the form of bank deposits, by making new loans. When a bank makes a loan, for example to someone taking out a mortgage to buy a house, it does not typically do so by giving them thousands of pounds worth of banknotes. Instead, it credits their bank account with a bank deposit of the size of the mortgage. At that moment, new money is created."
                        <cite>— Bank of England, "Money Creation in the Modern Economy" (2014)</cite>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>The Federal Reserve, Bank of England, and standard banking textbooks all acknowledge this. The truth is hiding in plain sight — it's just not widely understood.</p>

                    <div class="fun-fact">
                        <div class="fun-fact__label">Try This Yourself</div>
                        <p>Ask your bank: "When I got my mortgage, which account did the $300,000 come from?" They can't answer — because it didn't come from any account. It was created.</p>

                    <h2>What About Federal Reserve Notes?</h2>

                    <p>Look at a dollar bill. It says "Federal Reserve Note" at the top.</p>

                    <p>A "note" is a promise to pay. Federal Reserve Notes are just <strong>standardized, transferable versions</strong> of promises to pay — originally based on promissory notes like the one you signed for your mortgage.</p>

                    <div class="card">
                        <div class="card__title">The Historical Arc</div>
                        <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                            <li><strong>Before 1933:</strong> Federal Reserve Notes were redeemable for gold</li>
                            <li><strong>1933-1971:</strong> Only foreign governments could redeem for gold</li>
                            <li><strong>After 1971:</strong> Federal Reserve Notes are backed by... promises to pay</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <p>Today, all money is essentially someone's promise to pay. Your promissory note is the same type of instrument as a Federal Reserve Note — just not yet standardized for circulation.</p>

                    </div>
