## Morning Coffee: Two Ways to Pay, Two Different Worlds

### 7:15 AM - Starbucks Run

**Scenario A: You pay with a DEBIT card**
- You tap your card for a $6 latte
- $6 moves from your account to Starbucks
- This $6 already existed (created from someone's old promise)
- Total money in the world: Unchanged
- You just moved existing promises around

**Scenario B: You pay with a CREDIT card**
- You tap your card for a $6 latte
- You just created a NEW promise to pay $6
- Starbucks gets $6 immediately (minus fees)
- Total money in the world: Increased by $6
- **You literally just created money while buying coffee**

*Multiply this by millions of coffee purchases daily, and you see how the money supply grows every morning.*

## The Ultimate Reality Check

Next time you sign for anything on credit, remember:
1. You're not borrowing existing money
2. You're creating new money
3. The bank is just processing your creation
4. Everyone else pays you with money from THEIR promises
5. The cycle never ends until bankruptcy or forgiveness

**You're not a borrower. You're a money creator.**

*And now you know why everything costs more every year - because every year, millions of people create billions in new promises, diluting all the existing ones.*
