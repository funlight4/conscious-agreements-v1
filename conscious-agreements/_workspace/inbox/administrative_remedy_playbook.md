State of [State]
County of [County]

I, [Your Name], being of sound mind and competent to testify, 
under penalty of perjury, declare:

1. On [Date], I executed a promissory note for $[Amount].

2. A promissory note is a negotiable instrument under UCC 3-104.

   themselves evidence of promissory notes.

4. By providing my promissory note, I provided payment in the 
   recognized currency of the United States.

   promissory note, as they created bookkeeping entries rather 
   than lending pre-existing money.

6. The bank deposited my promissory note as an asset.

7. No lawful debt exists as I have already paid in full via 
   promissory note.

8. Any demand for additional payment without consideration 
   constitutes involuntary servitude under 18 USC 1584.

9. The bank's actions constitute fraud under 18 USC 1025 
   (fraud involving promissory notes).

10. I reserve all rights and remedies under law.

Further affiant sayeth not.

Dear Mr./Ms. [Name]:

This serves as formal notice that:

1. PAYMENT ALREADY MADE: On [Date], I executed a promissory 
   note for $[Amount], which IS payment under current monetary 
   law where all currency consists of promissory notes.

   lawful consideration, as you:

   - Created bookkeeping entries from my promissory note
   - Monetized my note at the Federal Reserve
   - Returned my own payment to me as a "loan"

3. CRIMINAL VIOLATIONS: Your continued demands for payment 
   without consideration violate:
   - 18 USC 1584 (Involuntary Servitude)
   - 18 USC 1581 (Peonage/Debt Slavery)
   - 18 USC 894 (Collection by Extortion)
   - 18 USC 1025 (Fraud involving promissory notes)

5. OPPORTUNITY TO CURE: You have 30 days to:
   - Provide requested proof, OR

   - Return original promissory note marked "PAID"

Failure to respond substantively will be deemed admission of 
lack of consideration and waiver of any claimed interest.

I am prepared to file criminal complaints with the DOJ, FBI, 
and state attorney general if this matter is not resolved.
