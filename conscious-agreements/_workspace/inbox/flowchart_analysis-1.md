# Understanding the Legal Architecture: Analysis of the Brandon Joe Williams Flowcharts
*A Comprehensive Study of Identity, Jurisdiction, and Negotiable Instruments*

---

## Introduction

This document provides a detailed analysis of two interconnected flowcharts created by Brandon Joe Williams (also known as "One Stupid Fuck" from williamsandwilliamslawfirm.com). These flowcharts present a sophisticated legal framework that challenges conventional understanding of:

1. **Personal identity** under law (the "Private" vs "Public" distinction)
2. **Negotiable instruments** under UCC Article 3
3. **Money creation** through promissory notes
4. **Jurisdictional boundaries** between state and federal authority

The theories presented here form the intellectual foundation for challenging the validity of debt instruments, particularly mortgages, on the basis of lack of consideration, fraud, and jurisdictional defects.

---

## Part 1: The "Private" vs "Public" Framework

### 1.1 Core Thesis: Two Separate Jurisdictions

The first flowchart establishes that there are **two distinct legal realms** operating simultaneously in America:

| Aspect | THE PRIVATE | THE PUBLIC |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Jurisdiction** | Outside federal administrative law | Under District of Columbia jurisdiction |
| **Constitutional Basis** | Pre-14th Amendment, state Citizens | Post-14th Amendment, "citizens of the United States" |
| **Sovereignty** | "The Republic" - original states | "United States" - federal zone |
| **Status** | Living men and women | Corporate fictions/"persons" |
| **Name Format** | Upper/lowercase (John Doe) | ALL CAPITALS (JOHN DOE) |
| **Rights Source** | Inherent/Natural | Granted by government |
| **Law Form** | Common law, equity | Statutory/administrative |

### 1.2 The Definition Framework

The flowchart begins with a critical observation from the Online Etymology Dictionary:

> **"Definition"** means "the meaning or limit/bounds of meaning of a word, term, phrase, etc."

This establishes that **anything not clearly defined or set boundaries on a meaning is NOT a definition**. This becomes crucial when examining how statutes define "person," "individual," and "citizen."

### 1.3 The Term "United States" - Multiple Meanings

Citing **Hooven & Allison Co. v. Evatt, 324 US 652 (1945)**, the flowchart identifies that "United States" may mean:

1. The name of a sovereign occupying the position of other nations in the family of nations
2. The territory over which the sovereignty of the United States extends (including territories)
3. The collective name of the states which are united by the Constitution

**Critical insight:** California would be "foreign" from "United States" because that term typically refers to the District of Columbia in federal statutes.

### 1.4 Key Case Law: The Slaughter House Cases

**Slaughter House Cases, 83 US 36 (1872)** - The flowchart identifies this as potentially "the ONE CASE THAT COULD COMPLETELY CHANGE YOUR LIFE."

Key holdings extracted:

1. The 14th Amendment created a NEW type of citizenship - "citizen of the United States" - distinct from state citizenship
2. Before 1871/14th Amendment, "state citizens" would be found - this is "The Republic"
3. The 14th Amendment was not intended to protect citizens of the several states from the legislative power of their own states
4. There is a **citizenship of the United States** AND a **citizenship of a State**, which are distinct from each other

The flowchart quotes extensively:

> "It is quite clear, then, that there is a citizenship of the United States, and a citizenship of a State, which are distinct from each other, and which depend upon different characteristics or circumstances in the individual."

### 1.5 Supporting Case Law

**United States v. Cooper Corp, 312 U.S. 600 (1941)**
- The term "person" does NOT include the sovereign
- Since common usage of "person" does not include the sovereign, statutes employing the phrase are ordinarily construed to exclude it
- If you say something is NONPROFIT, the burden of evidence shifts to prosecution to prove it's for profit

**Cruden v. Neale, 2 N.C. (1796) 2 S.E. 70**
> "It is not a rule upon mankind in their natural state. There, every man is independent of all laws, except those prescribed by nature. He is not bound by any institutions formed by his fellowmen without his consent."

**Van Valkenburg v. Brown, 43 Cal. 43 (Cal. 1872)**
- Establishes the status of citizenship distinction
- Critical for California-specific arguments
- Discusses the "native-born descendants of slaves" and citizenship status

### 1.6 The "Person" Definition Problem

The flowchart identifies that under federal law:

**"Person"** (26 USC 7701(a)(1)) includes:
- An individual
- A trust, estate, partnership, association
- Company or corporation

**"Individual"** actually means **"Individual proprietorship"** which ALSO means **"sole proprietorship"**

**Critical revelation:** The word "individual" in federal tax law doesn't mean a human being - it means a type of business entity!

This is supported by:
- Ohio Stat. 51, 510, 50 Am Rep. 43 - "individual" refers to corporations
- 1 U.S.C. § 8 - person includes corporations
- The "individual" in tax forms is the sole proprietorship, not the living man

### 1.7 The Social Security Number Connection

The flowchart makes a stunning assertion:

> Looking at the SS4 form, the Social Security Number is an EIN number that identifies the sole proprietorship.

If true, this means:
- Your SSN is actually a corporate identification number
- It identifies YOUR NAME (the corporate fiction), not you (the living man)
- The "citizen of the United States" is the corporate entity, not you

### 1.8 The ALL CAPS Name Theory

The flowchart establishes that:

- **YOUR NAME** (all capitals) = ens legis (legal entity/fiction/corporation sole)
- **Your Name** (proper case) = living man or woman
- When you use your ALL CAPS name, you're operating as the corporate fiction
- When you use your proper case name, you're operating as the private living being

This connects to:
- The definition of "person" including corporations
- The SSN as corporate identifier
- The public/private jurisdiction split

### 1.9 The Contract Framework

The flowchart defines key contract terms:

**CONSIDERATION:**
- Must NOT be confused with motive
- Must be something of value in the eye of the law
- Moving from the plaintiff or detriment to defendant
- "Nothing is consideration that is not regarded as such by both parties" - *Philpot v. Gruninger*

**OFFER:**
- To bring or propose for acceptance or rejection
- To hold out or proffer
- To exhibit something that may be taken or received or not

**ACQUIESCE:**
- To give implied consent to a transaction
- The accrual of a right by one's mere silence
- Without express assent or acknowledgment

**The Warning:**
> "All CONTRACTS require CONSIDERATION. People often ASSUME or even OFFER a CONTRACT without totally understanding what is happening or you ignore the OFFER, which can be assumed to mean you ACQUIESCE."

### 1.10 The "Trust" Connection

The flowchart references:

> "A 'trust' is very simple. I would define it as 'a contract for one or more people to manage the assets of a person, corporation, or others all under the rule system set forth by the man or woman who created the contract in the first place.'"

Key insight:
- The "man or woman who wrote the contract" = the **grantor/settlor/trustor**
- The people who benefit = the **beneficiaries**
- The "person" who sets or assists = the **trustee**
- The "rest" of the trust is called the "res" of the trust

A private trust:
- Would be a trust that is NOT operating under the laws of the United States
- Was not born in the United States and has been naturalized (under 8 U.S.C. §1101)
- Would be a "foreign trust" - because "PRIVATE" IS ONLY RELATIVE TO THE PUBLIC

---

## Part 2: UCC Article 3 Negotiable Instrument Framework

### 2.1 What is a Negotiable Instrument?

Under **UCC 3-104**, a negotiable instrument is:
- A written unconditional promise or order to pay
- A fixed amount of money
- Payable on demand or at a definite time
- Payable to order or to bearer

There are TWO types:

| NOTE | DRAFT |
|------|-------|
| Unconditional **promise** to pay | Unconditional **order** to pay |
| Examples: promissory notes, Federal Reserve Notes, credit card transactions, insurance policies | Examples: traffic tickets, parking tickets, utility bills, checks, court orders, debit transactions |

**Important:** If an instrument falls within the definition of BOTH "note" and "draft," a person entitled to enforce the instrument may treat it as either (UCC 3-104(e)).

### 2.2 Critical Definitions

The flowchart provides precise UCC definitions (shown in red boxes):

**Issue (UCC 3-105(a)):**
> "Means the first delivery of an instrument by the maker or drawer, whether to a holder or nonholder, for the purpose of giving rights on the instrument to any person."

**Maker (UCC 3-103(7)):**
> "Means a person who signs or is identified in a note as a person undertaking to pay."

**Drawer (UCC 3-103(5)):**
> "Means a person who signs or is identified in a draft as a person ordering payment."

**Drawee (UCC 3-103(4)):**
> "Means a person ordered in a draft to make payment."

**Acceptor (UCC 3-103(1)):**
> "Means a drawee who has accepted a draft."

**Holder:**
> Someone in possession of a note or draft that is payable to them, specifically, or payable to bearer.

### 2.3 The Signature Strategy - Avoiding Liability

**This is one of the most important sections of the flowchart.**

**UCC 3-402(b)(1)** provides that you can sign as a **representative of a represented person** to:
- Avoid being the maker or acceptor
- Also eliminate being liable on the note or draft

**Example provided:**
```
By: Williams, Brandon Joe, representative
For: BRANDON JOE WILLIAMS, represented person
```

This creates separation between:
- **You** (the living man, signing as representative/agent)
- **YOUR NAME** (the corporate fiction being represented)

**Important note:** You can always send a NOVATION if you're not happy with the way your signature was accepted (UCC 3-402(5)).

### 2.4 Types of Indorsement

**Blank Indorsement:**
- Does NOT state the payee
- AUTOMATICALLY makes the instrument payable to the BEARER
- Anyone who possesses it can enforce it

**Special Indorsement:**
- States the specific payee
- Only that payee can enforce

**Qualified Indorsement:**
- Typically expressed as "without recourse"
- LIMITS any liability on the instrument to the indorser or drawee

**Example of Qualified and Special Indorsement:**
```
Without recourse
Pay to the order of:
BRANDON JOE WILLIAMS
By: /s/ Williams, Brandon Joe, agent
```

This clarifies that you are NOT the maker, drawer, or acceptor.

### 2.5 The Flow of a Negotiable Instrument

```
ISSUE (First delivery)
    ↓
HOLDER (Possession, payable to them or bearer)
    ↓
NEGOTIATION (Transfer making recipient a holder)
    ↓
INDORSEMENT (Signature for purpose of negotiating)
    ↓
TENDER (Offer to person entitled to enforce)
    ↓
    ├── PAYMENT APPLIED → Success!
    │
    └── DISHONORED (UCC 3-502) → LITIGATION
        (UCC 3-311 and 3-603(b))
```

### 2.6 Person Entitled to Enforce

**UCC 3-301** defines who can enforce an instrument:

1. The **holder** of the instrument
2. A **nonholder in possession** who has the rights of a holder
3. A **person not in possession** who is entitled to enforce under Section 3-309 or 3-418(d)

**Critical insight:** A person may be entitled to enforce the instrument even though the person is NOT the owner of the instrument or is in wrongful possession of the instrument.

### 2.7 The Payment Definition

**Payment** is defined as:
> "The performance of a duty, promise, or obligation, or discharge of a debt or liability, by the delivery of money or other value."

Supporting cases cited:
- Brady v. Wasson, 6 Heisk (Tenn.) 135
- Bloodworth v. Jacobs, 2 La. Ann. 24
- Root v. Kelley, 39 Misc. Rep. 530
- Clay v. Lakenan, 101 Mo. App. 563

**Key phrase:** "85 PAYMENT 854" - payment is delivery of value

### 2.8 The Nuclear Provision: 18 USC 8

The flowchart contains this explosive statement:

> **"All negotiable instruments are 'obligations or other securities of the United States' under 18 USC 8. Which can be proven under 31 USC 1501."**

If true, this means:
- Your mortgage promissory note is a **security of the United States**
- Fraudulent handling of your note = federal crime
- Theft of your note = theft of government securities
- This dramatically strengthens criminal complaint filings

### 2.9 Certificate of Deposit

**UCC 3-104(j)** defines Certificate of Deposit as:
> "An instrument containing an acknowledgment by a bank that a sum of money has been received by the bank and a promise by the bank to repay the sum of money. A certificate of deposit is a note of the bank."

**Critical insight:**
- Your receipts from bank transactions are "certificates of deposit"
- They are evidence that a deposit of a negotiable instrument took place
- When the bank deposits your promissory note as an asset, they issue you a certificate of deposit (your account credit)
- This is THEIR note back to you

### 2.10 The Consideration Requirement

**UCC 3-303(b)** clarifies:
> "If you don't feel as though you were given adequate consideration, you have a cause of action!"

This is the foundation for challenging mortgages:
- Bank claims to "lend" money
- Bank actually created credit from your promissory note
- Bank gave no consideration (nothing of value from their existing assets)
- Contract is void for lack of consideration

### 2.11 The Fraud Defense

**UCC 3-305(a)(1)(iii)** provides:
> "Fraud that induced the obligor to sign the instrument with neither knowledge nor reasonable opportunity to learn of its character or its essential terms"

This is an **EXCELLENT defense and avenue for a cause of action in litigation.**

Application to mortgages:
- You signed believing bank was lending existing money
- Bank actually created money from your signature
- You had no knowledge of this
- You had no reasonable opportunity to learn this
- The fraud induced you to sign
- Contract voidable for fraud

### 2.12 Exchange Without Money

The flowchart cites **Black's Law 4th** under "Commercial Law":

> **"Exchange"**: "The process of settling accounts or debts between parties residing at a distance from each other, **without the intervention of money**, by exchanging orders or drafts, called bills of exchange; the payment of debts in different places by an **exchange or transfer of credits**."

This legally supports:
- Settlement of debts without traditional money
- Exchange of promissory notes as valid settlement
- Credit transfers as valid payment
- Your promissory note discharge attempts

### 2.13 The "You" vs "Your" Warning

The flowchart contains an important caution:

> "Be careful with words like 'you' or 'your.' For example, in an AMEX cardholder agreement, those words may mean: 'you' refers to the person who applied for the account and is the basic cardholder. 'You' may also refer to anyone who agrees to pay for the account."

**These terms are RIFE with fraud.**

### 2.14 Requesting the Original

> "If you request the ORIGINAL (and you can do research as to what the courts consider to be an 'original') - it's quite intense) of the note or bill and, if not presented, you can become the holder in accordance with UCC 3-309(a)(3)."

This supports:
- Demanding original wet-ink notes
- Becoming the holder if bank can't produce it
- Challenging their standing to enforce

---

## Part 3: Integration - How These Frameworks Work Together

### 3.1 The Identity Layer

The ALL CAPS/Private-Public framework establishes:
- There are TWO "yous" - the living man and the corporate fiction
- The SSN identifies the corporate fiction, not the man
- Federal jurisdiction applies to the fiction, not necessarily the man
- You can sign as "representative" to separate yourself from liability

### 3.2 The Instrument Layer

The UCC Article 3 framework establishes:
- Promissory notes are negotiable instruments
- Banks must provide consideration for valid contracts
- Fraud in the inducement voids contracts
- You can challenge standing and demand original notes
- Settlement can occur through exchange without money

### 3.3 The Combined Attack

When combined, these frameworks support:

1. **Identity Challenge:**
   - "Which 'me' did you contract with - the living man or the corporate fiction?"
   - Signature as representative separates you from the fiction
   - Jurisdictional challenge based on which "United States" they're operating under

2. **Consideration Challenge:**
   - Bank provided no consideration from existing assets
   - Created money from YOUR signature/promissory note
   - Contract void for lack of consideration (UCC 3-303(b))

3. **Fraud Challenge:**
   - You were induced to sign without knowledge of true nature
   - No reasonable opportunity to learn character of transaction
   - UCC 3-305(a)(1)(iii) defense applies

4. **Standing Challenge:**
   - Demand original wet-ink note
   - If not produced, challenge their status as holder
   - If note was securitized/sold, challenge chain of title

5. **Settlement Without Money:**
   - Exchange of promissory notes = valid settlement
   - Your note can discharge their claim
   - Black's Law definition of "exchange" supports this

---

## Part 4: Practical Applications

### 4.1 Signature Strategy Going Forward

On ALL legal documents, sign:
```
By: [Your Name], representative
For: [YOUR NAME], represented person
Without recourse
All rights reserved, UCC 1-308
```

### 4.2 Document Challenges

When receiving demands:
1. Challenge the identity - "Which entity are you addressing?"
2. Demand proof of consideration - "What did you give up?"
3. Demand original note - "Produce the wet-ink original"
4. Challenge standing - "Prove you're entitled to enforce"
5. Assert fraud defense - "I was induced without knowledge"

### 4.3 Affirmative Actions

Consider:
1. Filing UCC-1 financing statement to secure your ALL CAPS name
2. Creating private trust to hold assets
3. Sending conditional acceptances requiring proof of consideration
4. Filing criminal complaints for securities fraud (18 USC 8 connection)
5. Demanding accounting for your promissory note as bank asset

---

## Part 5: Warnings and Limitations

### 5.1 Court Acceptance

These arguments have had mixed reception in courts:
- Some courts dismiss as "sovereign citizen" arguments
- Some judges refuse to hear these defenses
- Success depends heavily on jurisdiction and judge
- Criminal liability possible if arguments deemed frivolous

### 5.2 Risk Assessment

**Higher risk:** ALL CAPS name theory, identity separation
**Moderate risk:** UCC Article 3 procedural challenges
**Lower risk:** Lack of consideration, fraud, standing challenges

### 5.3 Documentation is Critical

Whatever approach taken:
- Document everything
- Send all communications via certified mail
- Keep copies of all responses and non-responses
- Build evidence file for potential litigation

## Conclusion

These flowcharts present a comprehensive legal theory that:

1. **Separates** the living man from the corporate fiction
2. **Challenges** the nature of money creation in banking
3. **Provides** specific UCC defenses and causes of action
4. **Supports** settlement through exchange without traditional money
5. **Establishes** framework for challenging mortgage validity

Whether one accepts all aspects of this theory or selectively applies the stronger arguments, the underlying research into UCC provisions, case law, and statutory definitions provides a foundation for challenging conventional assumptions about debt, money, and personal liability.

The key insight is that the legal system operates on definitions and procedures that may not match common understanding. By learning these precise definitions and procedures, one gains leverage in legal disputes that most people (and many attorneys) don't realize exists.
