## DETAILED STATEMENT OF FACTS

### A. THE FRAUDULENT LOAN ORIGINATION

On or about _______________, I entered into what I believed was a legitimate mortgage loan with _______________. I was led to believe that the lender was loaning me pre-existing money from their deposits or capital.

**The fraud:** In reality, no pre-existing money was lent. The bank created bookkeeping entries using my promissory note as the source of funds. This constitutes:

- Bank fraud - misrepresenting the nature of the transaction
- Mail fraud - sending fraudulent loan documents through mail
- Wire fraud - electronic transfer of fraudulently created "funds"
- False statements - claiming money was being "lent"

### B. THE MONEY CREATION FRAUD

Evidence shows that banks do not lend depositors' money or their own capital. Instead:

1. My promissory note was deposited as an ASSET on the bank's books
2. The bank created a matching LIABILITY (deposit) in my account
3. No money moved from any existing account to fund the loan
4. My signature literally created the money
5. The bank then charged me interest on money I created

This is confirmed by:
- Federal Reserve publication "Modern Money Mechanics"
- Bank of England "Money Creation in the Modern Economy"
- Multiple Federal Reserve officials' statements
- Banking accounting practices (GAAP)

### C. THE SECURITIZATION FRAUD

After origination, the loan was allegedly:

1. Sold into a mortgage-backed security pool
2. The note and mortgage were separated (illegal)
3. Multiple parties claim ownership without proof
4. Original note was destroyed or "lost"
5. Assignments were robo-signed (fraudulent)
6. MERS was used to hide true ownership

### D. THE FORECLOSURE FRAUD

The suspects are now attempting foreclosure through:

- False claims of ownership (no original note)
- Fraudulent assignments created after-the-fact
- Robo-signed affidavits (perjury)
- Claiming standing they don't possess
- Refusing to validate the debt when requested
- Violating federal and state laws

### E. THE RICO ENTERPRISE

This is not an isolated incident but part of a pattern affecting millions of Americans:

- Systematic fraud in loan origination
- Widespread robo-signing operations
- Coordinated document fabrication
- Pattern of mail and wire fraud
- Ongoing criminal enterprise
- Billions in illegal profits
