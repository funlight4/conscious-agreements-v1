## 🛡️ NOTICE AND DEMAND FOR INDEMNIFICATION

### Protection from Multiple Claims on Same Note
### Identification of Real Party in Interest

## 🎯 Why This Document is Critical

In mortgage securitization, your note may have been sold multiple times to different parties. This creates the risk of multiple entities claiming the right to collect or foreclose. This document:

- **Forces identification** of the true note holder
- **Protects you** from paying the wrong party
- **Creates liability** for false claims
- **Exposes securitization fraud** if note was sold multiple times
- **Shifts risk** to the party claiming to own your debt

3. Upon information and belief, the promissory note has been sold, assigned, transferred, and/or securitized one or more times since origination.

4. Multiple parties may claim ownership or rights to collect on the same note due to:
   - Securitization into mortgage-backed securities
   - Multiple sales or assignments
   - MERS registration confusion
   - Lost or destroyed original note
   - Separation of note from mortgage/deed of trust
   - Fraudulent or defective assignments

5. I have a legal right to pay only the true owner and holder of the note, and to be protected from multiple claims on the same obligation.

## THE MULTIPLE CLAIMS PROBLEM

Due to securitization and the mortgage industry's practices, multiple parties may claim rights to my loan:

- **Current Servicer:** _______________
- **MERS:** May claim to hold legal title
- **Trust/Trustee:** _______________
- **Certificate Holders:** Unknown investors in mortgage-backed securities
- **Unknown Assignees:** Parties claiming through defective assignments

**Without proper indemnification, I risk:**
- Paying the wrong party
- Multiple parties demanding payment
- Double liability
- Multiple foreclosure actions
- Clouded title from competing claims

## DEMAND FOR INDEMNIFICATION

3. **SWORN AFFIDAVIT** identifying:
   - All parties who have ever claimed ownership of the note
   - Complete chain of title from origination
   - All securitization transactions
   - Current location of original wet-ink note
   - Identity of current true owner and holder

4. **AGREEMENT TO DEFEND** me against any claims by other parties at your sole expense.

5. **PERSONAL LIABILITY** acceptance by corporate officers for any false claims.

## LEGAL BASIS FOR DEMAND

**UCC § 3-305(c) - Claims to the Instrument**  
I am entitled to assert claims of other parties to the instrument as a defense.

**UCC § 3-602 - Payment**  
Payment to a party not entitled to enforce the instrument does not discharge the obligation.

**Common Law - Risk of Double Liability**  
I have the right to ensure I am paying the correct party and to be protected from multiple claims.

**Due Process**  
I have the constitutional right to know who my actual creditor is before being forced to pay.

**Real Party in Interest**  
Only the real party in interest has standing to collect or foreclose.

## SECURITIZATION COMPLICATIONS

If this loan was securitized, additional parties may have claims:

- **Depositor:** Entity that sold loans to trust
- **Sponsor:** Entity that assembled loan pool
- **Trust:** REMIC trust supposedly holding loans
- **Trustee:** Bank acting as trustee
- **Certificate Holders:** Investors in MBS
- **Servicer:** Entity collecting payments
- **Master Servicer:** Oversees servicers
- **Securities Administrator:** Handles distributions

**Each may claim rights, creating multiple liability exposure without indemnification.**

---

## ⏰ YOU HAVE 30 DAYS TO PROVIDE INDEMNIFICATION

**Deadline: _______________**

## ⚠️ WARNING: PERSONAL LIABILITY

Any person who claims right to collect without being the true owner and holder commits:

1. **REFUSAL TO PAY** - I will not make any payments without indemnification

2. **ESTOPPEL** - You will be estopped from claiming any right to collect

3. **ADMISSION** - Deemed admission that you are not the true owner

6. **CRIMINAL REFERRAL** - Report to law enforcement for fraud

7. **QUIET TITLE** - Grounds for quiet title action

## ALTERNATIVE: IDENTIFY TRUE OWNER

1. Identify the true owner and holder
2. Provide their name and contact information
3. Cease all collection efforts immediately
4. Correct any credit reporting
5. Withdraw any foreclosure proceedings

**True Owner Information (if not you):**

## 🔍 WHY THIS WORKS

### The Securitization Shell Game:

When mortgages are securitized:
1. Note sold to depositor
2. Depositor sells to trust
3. Trust issues certificates to investors
4. Servicer collects payments
5. MERS claims to track ownership

**Problem:** Each transfer may be defective, creating multiple potential claimants.

### Your Rights:
- Pay only the true owner
- Know who owns your debt
- Protection from double payment
- Clear chain of title
- Proper legal documentation

### Their Problem:
- Can't prove ownership
- Multiple parties involved
- Lost original notes
- Defective transfers
- Conflicting claims

---

## 💪 STRATEGIC POWER

### This Document Creates:

1. **Defensive Shield** - Can't foreclose without indemnification
2. **Offensive Weapon** - Evidence of fraud if refused
3. **Discovery Tool** - Forces disclosure of true ownership
4. **Negotiating Leverage** - They need your cooperation
5. **Court Evidence** - Shows good faith, their bad faith

### Common Servicer Problems:
- Don't actually own the note
- Can't identify true owner
- Note sold multiple times
- Original note destroyed
- Transfers were defective

---

## ⚖️ LEGAL PRECEDENTS

### Supporting Cases:
- **Carpenter v. Longan** - Note and mortgage must stay together
- **Ibanez** (Mass.) - Must prove ownership to foreclose
- **Glaski** (Cal.) - Late transfers void
- **Schwartzwald** (Ohio) - Standing required at filing

### Key Principle:
"The party seeking to foreclose must be the owner and holder of the note and mortgage at the time the action is filed."

---

## 🎯 SAMPLE RESPONSE IF THEY REFUSE

If they refuse to provide indemnification:

"Your refusal to provide indemnification is an admission that you are not the true owner and holder of the note. You have no authority to collect this alleged debt. Cease all collection efforts immediately or face legal action for fraud, conversion, and violation of federal law.

Your refusal will be used as evidence in my quiet title action and criminal complaints to federal authorities."

---

*Remember: This document protects you from the chaos of securitization where multiple parties may claim your debt. Without indemnification, you risk paying the wrong party and facing multiple claims. Their inability or refusal to indemnify proves they don't own your note.*
