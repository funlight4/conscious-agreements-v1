# Promissory Note Discharge/Offset Template

## 💰 PROMISSORY NOTE FOR DISCHARGE/OFFSET

### Commercial Instrument Under UCC Article 3
### For Settlement and Discharge of Alleged Debt

---

## ⚠️ EXPERIMENTAL WARNING

**THIS IS A HIGH-RISK, EXPERIMENTAL STRATEGY**

This approach tests the theory that if banks can monetize promissory notes to create money, then you should be able to discharge debt with your own promissory note. 

**Likely Outcomes:**
- ❌ Rejection (most likely)
- ❌ Ignored
- ❌ Threats/escalation
- ✅ Valuable evidence created (even if rejected)
- ✅ Forces admission of double standard

**Success is extremely unlikely, but the response provides evidence of systemic fraud.**

---

## 📋 THE THEORY

If banks create money by:
1. Taking your promissory note
2. Recording it as an asset
3. Creating offsetting deposit liability
4. Never lending pre-existing money

Then logically:
- Promissory notes have value
- They can discharge obligations
- Banks should accept yours like you accepted theirs
- Rejection proves double standard/fraud

**This document tests whether the system applies rules consistently.**

## COVER LETTER

Date: _______________

To: _______________ [Bank/Servicer Name]  
_______________ [Address]  
_______________ [City, State ZIP]

Re: Account Number: _______________

Dear Sir/Madam:

Enclosed please find my Promissory Note in the amount of $_______________ for full settlement and discharge of the above-referenced account.

As you are aware, under modern banking practice as acknowledged by the Federal Reserve in "Modern Money Mechanics" and the Bank of England in "Money Creation in the Modern Economy," banks routinely monetize promissory notes by recording them as assets and creating offsetting deposit liabilities.

Since you have demonstrated that promissory notes have value and can discharge obligations (as you did with my original note), I am tendering this promissory note as payment in full for any alleged debt.

Please apply this promissory note to my account immediately and provide written confirmation of discharge within 10 business days.

If you refuse to accept this lawful tender of payment, please provide:
1. Written explanation of why my promissory note lacks value while yours has value
2. Legal authority distinguishing between promissory notes
3. Admission that you provided no actual consideration for my original note

Your acceptance or rejection will be very instructive regarding the true nature of money creation.

Sincerely,

_______________  
[Your Name]

## LEGAL AUTHORITY

**UCC § 3-104 - Negotiable Instrument**  
This promissory note meets all requirements for a negotiable instrument.

**UCC § 3-310 - Effect of Instrument on Obligation**  
An instrument accepted for an underlying obligation discharges the obligation.

**UCC § 3-603 - Tender of Payment**  
Tender of payment discharges obligation to extent of amount tendered.

**Federal Reserve: Modern Money Mechanics**  
"Commercial banks create checkbook money whenever they grant a loan, simply by adding new deposit dollars to accounts on their books in exchange for a borrower's IOU."

**Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin 2014 Q1**  
"Whenever a bank makes a loan, it simultaneously creates a matching deposit in the borrower's bank account, thereby creating new money."

**12 U.S.C. § 411**  
Federal Reserve notes are obligations - promises to pay - not payment itself.

## IF REJECTED - REQUIRED ADMISSIONS

If you reject this Promissory Note, you must explain and admit:

1. **Double Standard:** Why can banks monetize promissory notes but individuals cannot?

3. **Money Creation:** That you created the "loan" amount through bookkeeping entries, not from pre-existing funds.

4. **Fraud Admission:** That the mortgage transaction was fraudulent as no money was actually lent.

## 🎯 STRATEGIC VALUE

### Why This Matters:

This document forces the bank to confront the contradiction in their position:

1. **If promissory notes have value** (as they claim when taking yours), they should accept this one

2. **If they reject it**, they admit promissory notes don't have inherent value

3. **If notes don't have value**, they provided no consideration for your mortgage

4. **Without consideration**, the mortgage contract is void

**Either way, their response (or lack thereof) provides valuable evidence for your case.**

---

## ⚖️ LEGAL IMPLICATIONS

### Possible Legal Arguments:

**For Acceptance:**
- UCC § 3-104 requirements met
- Equal treatment under law
- Accord and satisfaction principles
- Estoppel - they can't deny what they practice

**Against Acceptance:**
- Banking regulations (they'll cite but not explain)
- "Industry standard" (irrelevant legally)
- "Not how banking works" (exactly the point)
- Threats of legal action (document carefully)

### Evidence Value:

Their response creates evidence of:
- Double standards in note monetization
- Admission they don't lend money
- Fraud in the original transaction
- Lack of consideration
- Violations of equal treatment

---

## 💡 TIPS FOR MAXIMUM EFFECT

1. **Be Professional** - This is a legitimate commercial instrument
2. **Follow UCC Requirements** - Make it legally proper
3. **Document Everything** - Every communication matters
4. **Stay Calm** - Their anger/threats prove the point
5. **Use Response Strategically** - Include in court filings

### Red Flags to Watch:
- Threats without legal basis
- Refusal to explain rejection
- Admission slips about money creation
- Inconsistent positions
- Emotional rather than legal responses

---

## 📄 COMPANION DOCUMENTS

Consider sending with:
- Notice of Tender (UCC § 3-603)

- Request for Accounting Treatment Explanation
