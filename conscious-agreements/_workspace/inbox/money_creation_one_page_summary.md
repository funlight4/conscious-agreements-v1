# The Secret About Money Nobody Tells You
*A one-page guide to how money really works*

## The Shocking Truth in One Sentence
**When you sign for a loan, you're not borrowing the bank's money - your signature creates the money.**

## Here's What Really Happens

### When You Get a $300,000 Mortgage:
1. **You sign** a promise to pay (promissory note)
2. **Bank records** your promise as a $300,000 asset
3. **Bank creates** $300,000 in your account from nothing
4. **You think** you borrowed money that existed
5. **Reality:** Your signature created it

### The Proof Is on Every Dollar Bill
Look at any U.S. dollar. It says "Federal Reserve **Note**" - a note is a promise to pay. Since 1971 (when gold backing ended), these notes represent promises to pay... other notes. It's promises all the way down.

## The Credit Card vs. Debit Card Test

**Credit Card = Money Creation**
- You swipe → Create new promise → New money exists
- That's why banks push credit cards!

**Debit Card = Money Transfer**
- You swipe → Transfer existing promises → No new money
- Just moving existing debt-based money around

## Why This System Is Mathematically Doomed

### Simple 3-Person Example:
```
Day 1: No money exists
• Alice borrows $100 at 10% (creates $100, owes $110)
• Bob borrows $100 at 10% (creates $100, owes $110)
• Carol borrows $100 at 10% (creates $100, owes $110)

Total money created: $300
Total money owed: $330
Missing: $30 that doesn't exist!
```

**The $30 can only come from someone taking a NEW loan** (creating new promises).

## This Explains Everything

- **Why prices always go up:** System needs constant expansion
- **Why everyone's in debt:** It's mathematically required
- **Why banks got bailed out in 2008:** They process the promises that create money
- **Why bankruptcy exists:** Only way to actually escape (promise becomes void)

## The Bottom Line

✅ **You're more powerful than you think** - Your signature creates money  
✅ **Banks aren't what they seem** - They're promise processors, not money lenders  
✅ **The system requires debt** - Without growing debt, no money for interest  
✅ **Bankruptcy isn't failure** - It's the escape valve from an impossible system  

## Verify This Yourself

1. **Ask your bank:** "Which account did my loan money come from?" (They can't answer)
2. **Look up:** 12 U.S.C. § 411 - Says Federal Reserve Notes are redeemable in "lawful money" (What's that if not more Federal Reserve Notes?)
3. **Google:** "Banks create money when they make loans" - The Fed admits this

**Now you know: Every dollar is someone's debt. Your mortgage creates money. The system needs perpetual growth. And your signature has more power than you ever imagined.**
