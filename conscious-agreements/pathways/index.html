                    <h2>Understanding vs. Strategy</h2>

                    <p>There's an important distinction in these pathways:</p>

                    <div class="grid grid--2">
                        <div class="card">
                            <div class="card__title">What Provides Understanding</div>
                            <p class="card__text">Money creation mechanics. Promissory note equivalence. The consideration paradox. These help you SEE clearly what actually happened.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="card">
                            <div class="card__title">What Provides Strategy</div>
                            <p class="card__text">Procedural challenges. Standing questions. Chain of title issues. RESPA/TILA violations. These are what typically WIN in practical situations.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>The understanding gives you confidence and clarity. The strategy gives you practical tools. You need both.</p>

                    <div class="fun-fact">
                        <div class="fun-fact__label">The inner and outer game...</div>
                        <p>Courts may reject the consideration argument. But understanding it transforms how you carry yourself, what questions you ask, and how you negotiate. The person who truly understands money creation negotiates differently than someone who believes they're a "deadbeat borrower." Inner clarity creates outer leverage.</p>

                        <div class="important-box__title">Reality Check</div>
                        <p>These pathways are educational frameworks, not legal advice. Every situation is unique. The goal is to help you think clearly and act strategically — not to provide scripts or guarantee outcomes.</p>
                        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Consider professional legal counsel for significant matters. The knowledge here helps you ask better questions and evaluate advice more clearly.</p>
