RE: Debt Validation Request
    Account Reference: [Their Reference Number]

Dear Debt Collector:

I am in receipt of your communication dated [date].

I dispute this alleged debt in its entirety and request
validation pursuant to 15 USC 1692g.

Please provide:

1. The name and address of the original creditor
2. The original signed agreement bearing my signature
3. A complete accounting showing how the amount was calculated
4. Proof that you are licensed to collect in [Your State]
5. Proof of your authority to collect (assignment documentation)
6. Documentation that the original creditor provided consideration
7. Verification that the statute of limitations has not expired

Pursuant to 15 USC 1692g(b), cease all collection activity
until you provide this validation.

Do not contact me by telephone. All communication must be
in writing.

This dispute is made without prejudice to any rights I may have.

Sincerely,

[Your Signature]
[Your Printed Name]

                    <p>Debts have expiration dates for legal collection:</p>

                    <div class="card card--highlight">
                        <div class="card__title">After the Statute Expires</div>

                    <p>Statutes of limitations vary by state and debt type (typically 3-6 years for credit cards, 4-6 years for written contracts). Research your state's specific rules before taking any action.</p>

                        <p>Collectors sometimes push for "just a small payment to show good faith." This can restart the statute of limitations, giving them years to sue you again. Never pay anything without understanding the consequences.</p>

                        <li>For credit cards: Did they lend existing money, or create credit from your signature?</li>
                        <li>Can they document the source of funds?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Courts generally accept credit extension as consideration. But asking the question:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Creates a record of your position</li>

                            <li><strong>Attorney fees</strong> — Collector pays YOUR legal costs if you win</li>
                            <li><strong>Class action damages</strong> — Up to $500,000 or 1% of collector's net worth</li>
