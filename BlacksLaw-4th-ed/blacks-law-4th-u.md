Kahn v. Central Smelting Co., 2 Utah, 371; Caywood v.

The modern technical designation, in the law of

act of incorporation. State ex rel. v. Holston
Trust Co., 168 Tenn. 546, 79 S.W.2d 1012, 1016.
The term has a broad. application and includes not
only acts prohibited by the charter, but acts
which are in excess of powers granted and not
prohibited. State ex rel. Supreme Temple of Py-
thian Sisters v. Cook, 234 Mo.App. 898, 136 S.W.2d
142, 146, and generally applied either when a cor-
poration has no power whatever to do an act, or
when the corporation has the power but exercises
it irregularly. People ex rel. Barrett v. Bank of
Peoria, 295 Ill.App. 543, 15 N.E.2d 333, 335. Act
is "ultra vires" when corporation is without au-
thority to perform it under any circumstances or
for any purpose. Orlando Orange Groves Co. v.
Hale, 107 Fla. 304, 144 So. 674, 676.
By doctrine of "ultra vires" a contract made by a cor-
poration beyond the scope of its corporate powers is un-
lawful. Community Federal Say. & Loan Ass'n of Inde-
pendence, Mo., v. Fields, C.C.A.Mo., 128 F.2d 705, 708.
While the phrase "ultra vires" has been used to desig-
nate, not only acts beyond the express and implied powers
of a corporation, but also acts contrary to public policy or
contrary to some express statute prohibiting them, the
latter class of acts is now termed illegal, and the "ultra
vires" confined to the former class. In re Grand Union
Co., C.C.A.N.Y., 219 F. 353, 363; Staacke v. Routledge, 111
Tex. 489, 241 S.W. 994, 998; Pennsylvania H. Co. v. Minis,

volunteer witness; one who appears to give evi-

## UMPIRAGE

The decision of an umpire. Powell
v. Ford, 4 Lea (Tenn.) 288. The word "Umpir-

the word "award," in reference to arbitrators; but
"award" is commonly applied to the decision of
the umpire also.

## UMPIRE

One clothed with authority to act alone
in rendering a decision where arbitrators have dis-
agreed. Hughes v. National Fuel Co., 121 W.Va.
392, 3 S.E.2d 621, 626.
When matters in dispute are submitted to two or more
arbitrators, and they do not agree in their decision, it is
usual for another person to be called in as "umpire," to
whose sole judgment it is then referred. Brown. And see
Ingraham v. Whitmore, 75 Ill. 30; Tyler v. Webb, 10 B.
Mon. (Ky.) 123; Lyon v. Blossom, 4 Duer (N.Y.) 325. An
"umpire," strictly speaking, makes his award independent-
ly of that of the arbitrators. Dennis v. Standard Fire Ins.
Co., 90 N.J.Eq. 419, 107 A. 161, 163.

## UN-

A prefix used indiscriminately, and may
mean simply "not." Thus, "unlawful" means "not
authorized by law." State v. Sanders, 136 La.
1059, 68 So. 125, 126, Ann.Cas.1916E, 105.

## UN NE DOLT PRISE ADVANTAGE DE SON TORT DEMESNE

not to take advantage of his own wrong.

ly; without dissent.

viding that evidence given in a former trial may

ly unable. Hansen-Rynning v. Oregon-Washing-
ton R. & Nay. Co., 105 Or. 67, 209 P. 462, 464.

Richardson v. Woodbury, 43 Me. 214.

ing. Lawrie v. Miller, Tex.Com.App., 45 S.W.2d

## UNANIMITY

cerned, in holding one and the same opinion or
determination of any matter or question; as the
concurrence of a jury in deciding upon their ver-
dict. See Unanimous.

## UNANIMOUS

To say that a proposition was
adopted by a "unanimous" vote does not always
mean that every one present voted for the proposi-
tion, but it may, and generally does, mean, when a
viva voce vote is taken, that no one voted in the
negative. State v. Stephens, 195 Mo.App. 34, 189
S.W. 630, 631.

## UNASCERTAINED

Not certainly known or de-
termined. Commissioner of Internal Revenue v.
Owens, C.C.A.10, 78 F.2d 768, 773.

## UNASCERTAINED DUTIES

Payment in gross,
on an estimate as to amount, and where the mer-
chant, on a final liquidation, will be entitled by
law to allowances or deductions which do not de-
pend on the rate of duty charged, but on the as-
certainment of the quantity of the article subject
to duty. Moke v. Barney, 5 Blatchf. 274, Fed.
Cas.No.9,698.

## UNAVOIDABLE

Not avoidable, incapable of be-
ing shunned or prevented, inevitable, and neces-
sary. Day Wood Heel Co. v. Rover, 123 Ohio St.
349, 175 N.E. 588, 590.

## UNAVOIDABLE ACCIDENT

An inevitable ac-
cident. Leland v. Empire Engineering Co., 135
Md. 208, 108 A. 570, 575, which could not have
been foreseen and prevented by using ordinary
diligence, and resulting without fault. U. S. v.
Kansas City Southern Ry. Co., D.C.Ark., 189 F.
471. Not necessarily an accident which it was
physically impossible, in the nature of things, for
the person to have prevented, but one not occa-
sioned in any degree, either remotely or directly,
by the want of such care or skill as the law holds
every man bound to exercise. An accident which
could not be prevented by the exercise of ordinary
care and prudence. Wollaston v. Stiltz, 114 A.
198, 200, 1 W.W.Harr. 273; Atlantic Coast
Line R. Co. v. Cook, 34 Ga.App. 1, 128 S.E. 75, 76.
A casualty which occurs without negligence of
either party and when all means which common
prudence suggests have been used to prevent it.
Bucktrot v. Partridge, 130 Okl. 122, 265 P. 768, 771.
The term is sometimes defined, however, as synonymous
with "act of God,"-any accident produced by physical
causes which are inevitable, such as lightnings, storms,
perils of the sea, earthquakes, inundations, sudden death,
or illness. Early v. Hampton, 15 Ga.App. 95, 82 S.E. 669,
UNAVOIDABLE CASUALTY. An event or acci-
dent which human prudence, foresight, and sa-
gacity cannot prevent, happening against will and
without negligence. Fernwood Mining Co. v.
Pluma, 211 S.W. 159, 163, 138 Ark. 193; Sabin v.
Sunset Garden Co., 184 Okl. 106, 85 P.2d 294, 295.
Welles v. Castles, 3 Gray (Mass.) 325. Within the
meaning of statutes in several states relating to
the vacation of judgments, means some casualty
or misfortune growing out of conditions or cir-
cumstances that prevented the party or his at-
torney from doing something that, except there-
for, would have been done, and does not include
mistakes or errors of judgment growing out of
misconstruction or understanding of the law, or
the failure of parties or counsel through mistake
to avail themselves of remedies, which if resorted
to would have prevented th' casualty or misfor-
tune.
If by any care, prudence, or foresight a thing could have
been guarded against, it is not unavoidable. Central Line
of Boats v. Lowe. 50 Ga. 509; E. P. Barnes & Bro. v.
Eastin, 190 Ky. 392, 227 S.W. 578, 580. The term is not
ordinarily limited to an act of God. Kirby v. Davis, 21(1
Ala. 192, 97 So. 655, 656.
The term refers to events which human prudence or fore-
sight cannot prevent (but see Kohlman v. Moore, 175 Ky.
710, 194 S.W. 933, 935), such as disease and death, mis-
carriage of the mails, or mistake in the wording of a
telegram. Wagner v. Lucas, 79 Okl. 231, 193 P. 421, 422.
It may include the sickness. Thweatt v. Grand Temple
and Tabernacle of International Order of Twelve Knights
and Daughters of Tabor, of Arkansas, 128 Ark. 269, 193 S.
W. 508, 509, or death of an attorney, Columbia County
v. England, 151 Ark. 465, 236 S.W. 625, 626, or his failure,
through some oversight or misunderstanding, to defend.
Krause v. Hobart, 173 Iowa, 330, 155 N.W. 279, but it does
not apply to the neglect of an attorney or his client;
Gavin v. Heath, 125 Okl. 118, 256 P. 745, 746; McGuire v.
Mishawaka Woolen Mills, 218 Ky. 530, 291 S.W. 747, 749.

## UNAVOIDABLE CAUSE

ably prudent and careful men under like circum-
stances do not and would not ordinarily anticipate,
and whose effects, under similar circumstances,
they do not and would not ordinarily avoid. Chi-
cago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. U. S., 114 C.C.A. 334, 194
F. 342.

## UNAVOIDABLE DANGERS

This term in a ma-
rine policy covering unavoidable dangers of the
river includes the unexplained capsizing of a ves-
sel, though human intervention existed in the op-
eration of the vessel, for "unavoidable dangers"
mean those unpreventable by persons operating
the vessel, and, like the term perils of the sea,
include ail kinds of marine casualties, thus includ-
ing accidents in which there is human interven-
tion. A river vessel's tendency to turn over, due
to topheavy construction, necessary on account of
the shallowness of rivers, is an "unavoidable dan-
ger" within the policy. Hillman Transp. Co. v.
Home Ins. Co. of New York, 268 Pa. 547, 112 A.
108, 111.

## UNBOLTED CORN MEAL

The courts judicially
know that corn meal is an unmixed meal made
from entire grains of corn, and that "unbolted
corn meal" is simply meal not bolted, or from
which the bran has not been sifted or separated.
Miller Grain & Commission Co. v. International
Sugar Feed No. 2 Co., 197 Ala. 100, 72 So. 368.

called upon to execute or interpret it, so that no
definite meaning can be extracted from it.

## UNCHASTITY

Impurity in mind and conduct,
which may exist without actually engaging in un-
lawful sexual intercourse. State v. Valvoda, 170

ter German Ins. Co. v. Schmidt, 89 C.C.A. 333, 162
F. 447. See the subtitle "Sole and unconditional

## UNCONSCIONABLE BARGAIN

All unconscion-
able bargain or contract is one which no man in
his senses, not under delusion, would make, on the
one hand, and which no fair and honest man would
accept, on the other. Hume v. U. S., 10 S.Ct. 134,
132 U.S. 406, 33 L.Ed. 393; Edler v. Frazier, 174
Iowa 46, 156 N.W. 182, 187; Hall v. Wingate, 159

## UNCONSCIOUS

v. Ray, 64 Ga.App. 540, 13 S.E.2d 848, 852.

## UNCONSTITUTIONAL

That which is contrary
to the constitution. The opposite of "constitu-
tional." See State v. McCann, 4 Lea (Tenn.) 10;
In re Rahrer, C.C.Kan., 43 F. 558, 10 L.R.A. 444;
Norton v. Shelby County, 6 S.Ct. 1121, 118 U.S.
425, 30 L.Ed. 178. The word does not necessarily
mean that the act assailed is contrary to sound
principles of legislation. Ketterer v. Lederer, D.
C.Pa., 269 F. 153, 154.
This word is used in two different senses. One, which
may be called the English sense, is that the legislation
conflicts with some recognized general principle. This is
no more than to say that it is unwise, or is based upon a
wrong or unsound principle, or conflicts with a generally
accepted policy. The other, which may be called the Amer-
ican sense, is that the legislation conflicts with some pro-
vision of our written Constitution, which it is beyond the
power of the Legislature to change. U. S. v. American
Brewing Co., D.C.Pa., 1 F.2d 1001, 1002.
This expression as applied to an act of parliament means
simply that it is, in the opinion of the speaker, opposed
to the spirit of the English constitution; it cannot mean
that the act is either a breach of the law or is void. When
applied to a law passed by the French parliament, it
means that the law is opposed to the articles of the consti-
tution; it does not necessarily mean that the law in ques-
tion is void, for it is by no means certain that any French
court will refuse to enforce a law because it is unconstitu-
tional. It would probably, though not of necessity, be,
when employed by a Frenchman, a term of censure. Dic-
ey, Const. 516.

## UNCONTROLLABLE

Incapable of being con-
trolled or ungovernable. Alford v. Zeigler, 65 Ga.
App. 294, 16 S.E.2d 69, 72.

## UNCONTROLLABLE IMPULSE

As an excuse
for the commission of an act otherwise criminal,
this term means an impulse towards its commis-
sion of such fixity and intensity that it cannot be
resisted by the person subject to it, in the enfeeb-
led condition of his will and moral sense resulting
from derangement or mania. See Insanity. And
see State v. O'Neil, 51 Kan. 651, 33 P. 287, 24 L.R.A.

## UNCORE PRIST

L. Fr. Still ready. A species
of plea or replication by which the party alleges
that he is still ready to pay or perform all that
is justly demanded of him. In conjunction with
the phrase "tout temps prist," it signifies that he
has always been and still is ready to do what is
required, thus saving costs where the whole cause
is admitted, or preventing delay where it is a
replication, if the allegation is made out. 3 Bl.
Comm. 303.

## UNCUTH

## UNDEFENDED

A term sometimes applied to
one who is obliged to make his own defense when
on trial, or in a civil cause. A cause is said to be
undefended when the defendant makes default,
in not putting in an appearance to the plaintiff's
action; in not putting in his statement of defense;
or in not appearing at the trial either personally
or by counsel, after having received due notice.
Mozley & Whitley.

## UNDER

Sometimes used in its literal sense of
below in position, beneath, but more frequently
in its secondary meaning of "inferior" or "sub-
ordinate." Mills v. Stoddard, Mo., 49 U.S. 345, 8
How. 356, 12 L.Ed. 1107; Biordi v. Yanosevich, 93
Pa.Super. 578, 582.

## UNDER CONTROL

sarily mean the ability to stop instanter under any

to a stop with a reasonable degree of celerity.
Esponette v. Wiseman, 130 Me. 297, 155 A. 650,
653. Am. motorist is only bound to use that de-
gree of care, caution, and prudence that an or-
dinarily careful, cautious, and prudent man would
have used at the time under same or similar cir-
cumstances in operation of said automobile. Greg-
ory v. Suhr, 221 Iowa 1283, 268 N.W. 14, 17. In
general, as applied to street cars or railroad trains,
the term denotes the control and preparation ap-
propriate to probable emergencies. Lincoln v.
Pacific Electric Ry. Co., 33 Cal.App. 83, 164 P.
412, 415; Torantolla v. Kansas City Rys. Co., Mo.
App., 226 S.W. 617, 618. It is such control as will
enable a train to be stopped promptly if need
should arise. Missouri K. & T. Ry. Co. v. Mis-
plies the ability to stop within the distance the
track is. seen to be clear. Fuller v. Oregon-Wash-
ington R. & Nay. Co., 93 Or. 160, 181 P. 338, 341.

ments from place to place on a public range or

Stock Ass'n, 68 Mont. 104, 217 P. 663, 665.

## UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR

Phrase as used in statutes or ordi-
nances prohibiting the operation of motor vehicle
by a party under the influence of intoxicating liq-
uor covers not only all well-known and easily rec-
ognized conditions and degrees of intoxication,
but any abnormal mental or physical condition
which is the result of indulging in any degree in
intoxicating liquors, and which tends to deprive
one of that clearness of intellect and control of
himself which he would otherwise possess. Com-
monwealth v. Long, 131 Pa.Super. 28, 198 A. 474,
477. Any condition where intoxicating liquor has
so far affected the nervous system, brain or
muscles of the driver as to impair, to an appre-
ciable degree, his ability to operate his automobile
in the manner that an ordinary, prudent and cau-
tious man, in full possession of his faculties, using
reasonable care, would operate or drive under
like conditions. Luellen v. State, 64 Okl.Cr. 382,
81 P.2d 323, 328.

## UNDER WAY

fast to the shore, or aground;—said of vessels

Stallings, 165 Md. 615, 170 A. 163, 164.

## UNDISPUTED FACT

Within the meaning of a
statute, an admitted fact, which the court has not
or has inadvertently omitted from it; a fact not
found by the court does not become an "undisput-
ed fact," merely because one or more witnesses

Yarn Co. v. American Fabrics Co., 102 Conn. 529,
129 A. 527, 532.

## UNDIVIDED PROFITS

Profits which have not
in fact been divided or distributed, English &
Mersick Co. v. Eaton, D.C.Conn., 299 F. 646, 649;
or otherwise used, Douglas v. Edwards, C.C.A.N.
Y., 298 F. 229, 237. Current undistributed earn-
ings. Edwards v. Douglas, 46 S.Ct. 85, 89, 269 U.
S. 204, 70 L.Ed. 235. Winkelman v. General Mo-
tors Corporation, D.C.N.Y., 44 F.Supp. 960, 966.

U. S., D.C.Pa., 12 F.2d 598, 600.
The terms "surplus" and "undivided profits" have differ-
ent meanings in banking circles. State ex rel. Payne v.
Exchange Bank of Natchitoches, 84 So. 481, 482, 147 La. 25.
Surplus, like the capital stock, constitutes the working
capital of the bank and is, in addition, a fund for the
protection of the depositors. The "undivided profits" con-
stitute a temporary fund changing in size from day to day
and carried only until dividend periods when it is distrib-
uted to the stockholders or transferred to the permanent
surplus. It is the fund from which the expenses and
losses of the bank are paid. Sarles v. Scandinavian
American Bank, 33 N.D. 40, 156 N.W. 556, 557.
"Surplus" and "undivided profits," as commonly em-
ployed in corporate accounting, denote an excess in the
aggregate value of the assets of the corporation over the
sum of liabilities, including capital stock; "surplus" de-
scribing such part of the excess in the value of the corpo-
rate assets as is treated by the corporation as part of the
permanent capital, while the term "undivided profits"
designates such part of the excess as consists of profits
neither distributed as dividends nor carried to the surplus
*account. Willcuts v. Milton Dairy Co., 48 S.Ct. 71, 72, 275
U.S. 215, 72 L.Ed. 247.

Norte County, 28 Cal.App. 391, 152 P. 957, 958.

75 W.Va. 200, 83 S.E. 922, 924, L.R.A.1917E, 970.
It denotes something wrong, according to the standard
of morals which the law enforces in relations of men, and
in fact illegal, and qualifies the purpose with which in-

agency or destroys freedom of his will and rem
ders it more the will of another than his own.
Conner v. Brown, Del., 3 A.2d 64, 71, 9 W.W.Harr.
529; In re Velladao's Estate, 31 Cal.App.2d 355,
88 P.2d 187, 190.
"Undue influence" is not necessarily physical injury or
threat of it, but is a species of duress, or at least often in-
distinguishable from it. Trigg v. Trigg, 37 N.M. 296, 22
P.2d 119. And although there is no coercion amounting to
duress, but transaction is result of moral, social, or domes-
tic force, consciously and designedly exerted on party,
peculiarly susceptible to external pressure on account of
mental weakness, old age, ignorance, and the like, control-
ling the free action of the will, and preventing a true con-
sent, equity may relieve against the transaction on the
ground of "undue influence." In re Null's Estate, 302 Pa.
64, 153 A. 137, 139. But modest persuasion or arguments
addressed to the understanding or the appeal of affection
cannot be deemed "undue influence". Calveard v. Reyn-
olds, 281 Ky. 518, 136 S.W.2d 795, 799.
Undue influence consists (1) in the use, by one in
whom a confidence is reposed by another, or who holds a
real or apparent authority over him, of such confidence or
authority, for the purpose of obtaining an unfair advan-
tage over him; (2) in taking an unfair advantage of an-
other's weakness of mind; or (3) in taking a grossly op-
pressive and unfair advantage of another's necessities or
distress. Buchanan v. Prall, 39 N.D. 423, 167 N.W. 488,
489; Dolliver v. Dolliver, 94 Cal. 642, 30 P. 4.
"Undue influence," such as will invalidate a will, must
be something which destroys the free agency of the testa-
tor at the time when the instrument is made, and which,
in effect, substitutes the will of another for that of the
testator. It is not sufficient that the testator was in-
fluenced by the beneficiaries in the ordinary affairs of life,
or that he was surrounded by them and in confidential re-
lations with them at the time of its execution. Mere
general influence, not brought to bear on the testamentary
act, is not undue influence; but in order to constitute un-
due influence, it must be used directly to procure the will,
and must amount to coercion destroying the free agency
of the testator. Mere suspicion that undue influence was
brought to bear is not sufficient to justify the setting aside
of the will. Myers v. Myers, 130 Okl. 184, 266 P. 452, 455.
To constitute "undue influence," justifying denial or revo-
cation of probate of will, testator's mind must have been
so controlled or affected by persuasion or pressure, artful
or fraudulent contrivances, or by influences of persons in
close confidential relations with him, that he is not left to
act intelligently, understandingly, and voluntarily, but
subject to will or purposes of another. In re Starr's Es-
tate, 125 Fla. 536, 170 So. 620. Solicitation, importunity,
argument, advice, and persuasion are not "undue influ-
ence" sufficient to avoid a contract or will. Influence ob-
tained by persuasion and argument, or gained by kind-
ness and affection, is not prohibited, where no imposition
or fraud is practiced, and where the person's will is not
overcome. Barron v. Reardon, 137 Md. 308, 113 A. 283, 285;
Stump v. Sturn, C.C.A.W.Va., 254 F. 535, 538.
Undue influence at elections occurs where any
one interferes with the free exercise of a voter's
franchise, by violence, intimidation, or otherwise.
It is a misdemeanor. 1 Russ.Crimes, 321; Steph.
Crim. Dig. 79.

## UNEARNED INCREMENT

Value due to no la-
bor or expenditure on the part of an owner but to
natural causes making an increased demand for
it, such as increase of population or the general
progress of society. Miller v. Huntington & Ohio
Bridge Co., 123 W.Va. 320, 15 S.E.2d 687, 699.

## UNEDUCATED

Not synonymous with illiterate.
A man might be able to read and write, carry on
a business correspondence, understand business
transactions, and be bound by all his contracts,
and yet be an "uneducated" man. Baker v. Pat-
ton, 144 Ga. 502, 87 S.E. 659, 660.

## UNEMPLOYMENT

State of being not employed,
lack of employment. A. J. Meyer & Co. v. Unem-
ployment Compensation Commission, 348 Mo. 147,
152 S.W.2d 184, 189.

## UNEQUAL

Not uniform. Los Angeles County
v. Ransohoff, 24 Cal.App.2d 238, 74 P.2d 828, 830.
Ill-balanced; uneven; partial; unfair;—not syn-
onymous with inappropriate, which means un-
suitable, unfit, or improper. Lane v. St. Denis
Catholic Church of Benton, Mo.App., 274 S.W.
1103, 1106.

## UNEQUIVOCAL

Clear; plain; capable of being
understood in only one way, or as clearly demon-
strated; free from uncertainty, or without doubt;
and, when used with reference to the burden of
proof, it implies proof of the highest possible
character and it imports proof of the nature of
mathematical certainty. Berry v. Maywood Mut.
Water Co. No. 1, 11 Cal.App.2d 479, 53 P.2d 1032;
Molyneux v. Twin Falls Canal Co., 54 Idaho 619,
35 P.2d 651, 656, 94 A.L.R. 1264.

## UNERRING

Incapable of error or failure; cer-
tain; sure; infallible. Gardner v. State, 27 Wyo.
316, 196 P. 750, 752, 15 A.L.R. 1040.

## UNETHICAL

Not ethical; hence, colloquially,
not according to business or professional stand-
ards. Kraushaar v. La Vin, 181 Misc. 508, 42 N.
Y.S.2d 857, 859.

## UNETHICAL CONDUCT

Authorizing recovery
of broker's commission for sale completed by an-
other broker means a purpose to obtain profits
from broker's exertions without payment, and
exists where employer revokes the broker's au-
thority and makes the sale through other means

warning, sudden. Bachus v. Ronnebaum, 98 Ind.
App. 603, 186 N.E. 386, 387.

## UNEXPIRED TERM

Remainder of a period pre-
scribed by law after a portion of such time has
passed, and phrase is not synonymous with "va-
cancy." State ex rel. Sanchez v. Dixon, La.App.,
4 So.2d 591, 596.

## UNFAIR

In the labor movement, unfriendly to
organized labor; refusing to recognize its rules
and regulations ;—applied particularly to employ-
ers, e. g., one who refuses to employ members of
a trade union. Steffes v. Motion Picture Mach.
Operators' Union, 136 Minn. 200, 161 N.W. 524.
A characterization of an employer who refuses
to conduct his business in manner desired by
union. John R. Thompson Co. v. Delicatessen

International Brotherhood of Teamsters, 125 W.
Va. 165, 23 S.E.2d 645, 650.

## UNFAIR COMPETITION

A term which may be
applied generally to all dishonest or fraudulent
rivalry in trade and commerce, but is particu-
larly applied in the courts of equity (where it
may be restrained by injunction) to the practice
of endeavoring to substitute one's own goods or
products in the markets for those of another, hav-
ing an established reputation and extensive sale,
by means of imitating or counterfeiting the name,
title, size, shape, or distinctive pecularities of the
article, or the shape, color, label, wrapper, or gen-
eral appearance of the package, or other such
simulations, the imitation being carried far
enough to mislead the general public or deceive
an unwary purchaser, and yet not amounting to
an absolute counterfeit or to the infringement of
a trade-mark or trade-name. Called in France
"concurrence deloyale" and in Germany "unlau-
terer Wettbewerb." Reddaway v. Banham, [1896]
App.Cas. 199; Singer Mfg. Co. v. June Mfg. Co.,
16 S.Ct. 1002, 163 U.S. 169, 41 L.Ed. 118; Dennison
Mfg. Co. v. Thomas Mfg. Co., C.C.Del., 94 F. 651;
Sterling Remedy Co. v. Eureka Chemical Co., 25
C.C.A. 314, 80 F. 108.
The simulation by one person of the name, ma-
terials, color scheme, symbols, patterns, or devices
employed by another for purpose of deceiving the
public, or substitution of goods, or wares of one
person for those of another, thus falsely induc-
ing purchase of goods and obtaining benefits be-
longing to competitor. Mathews Conveyor Co. v.
Palmer-Bee Co., C.C.A.Mich., 135 F.2d 73, 84; Ess-
kay Art Galleries v. Gibbs, 205 Ark. 1157, 172 S.
W.2d 924, 926. American Fork & Hoe Co. v. Stam-
pit Corporation, C.C.A.Ohio, 125 F.2d 472, 474, 475.
Passing off, or attempting to pass off upon the
public the goods or business of one person as the
goods or business of another. Westminister Laun-
dry Co. v. Hesse Envelope Co., 174 Mo.App. 238,
156 S.W. 767, 768; Sayre v. McGill Ticket Punch
Co., D.C.Ill., 200 F. 771, 773; Socony-Vacuum Oil
Co. v. Oil City Refiners, C.C.A.Ohio, 136 F.2d 470,
474. The selling of another's product as one's
own. A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corporation v.
United States, N.Y., 55 S.Ct. 837, 844, 295 U.S. 495,
79 L.Ed. 1570, 97 A.L.R. 947. The sale of goods by
means which shock judicial sensibilities. Mar-
garete Steiff v. Bing, D.C.N.Y., 215 F. 204, 206.
See, however, Federal Trade Commission v. Gratz,
40 S.Ct. 572, 575, 253 U.S. 421, 64 L.Ed. 993. Also
deceitful advertising which injures a competitor,
bribery of employees, secret rebates and conces-
sions, and other devices of unfair trade. In re
Northern Pigment Co., Cust. & Pat. App., 71 F.2d
447, 453.
Fraudulent intent is a necessary ingredient of unfair
competition. Queen Mfg. Co. v. Isaac Ginsberg & Bros.,
C.C.A.Mo., 25 F.2d 284, 288.
The equitable doctrine of "unfair competition" is not
confined to cases of actual market competition between
similar products of different parties, but extends to all
cases in which one party fraudulently seeks to sell his
goods as those of another. Wisconsin Electric Co. v. Du-
Test of "unfair competition" is, not whether distinction
between two competing products can be recognized when
placed alongside each other, but whether, when the two
products are not viewed together, a purchaser of ordinary
prudence would be induced by reason of the marked re-
semblance in general effect to mistake one for the other
despite differences in matters of detail. Ralston Purina Co.
v. Checker Food Products Co., Mo.App., 80 S.W.2d 717, 719,
UNFAIR HEARING. Where the defect, or the
practice complained of, was such as might have
led to a denial of justice, or where there was ab-
sent one of the elements deemed essential to due
process. Ex parte Bridges, D.C.Cal., 49 F.Supp.
292, 302, 306; Bufalino v. Irvine, C.C.A.Kan., 103
F.2d 830, 832; Kielema v. Crossman, C.C.A.Tex.,
103 F.2d 292, 293.

## UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE

Within National
Labor Relations Act for an employer: (1) To in-
terfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the
exercise of their rights to self-organization, to
form, join or assist labor organizations, to bar-
gain collectively through representatives of their
own choosing, and to engage in concerted activ-
ities, for the purpose of collective bargaining or
other mutual aid or protection. (2) To dominate
or interfere with the formation or administration
of any labor organization or contribute financial or
other support to it. (3) By discrimination in re-
gard to hire or tenure of employment or any term
or condition of employment to encourage or dis-
courage membership in any labor organization.
(4) To discharge or otherwise discriminate against
an employee because he has filed charges or given
testimony under the Act. (5) To refuse to bar-
gain collectively with the representatives of his
employees. National Labor Relations Act, §§ 7,
8, 29 U.S.C.A. §§ 102.1 et seq., 157, 158.
The following has been held to be "unfair labor prac-
tice" under National Relations Act:
Failure to re-employ striking employees. Western Cart-
ridge Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, C.C.A.7, 139
F.2d 855, 858. Refusal of employer to reinstate union

in plant. National Labor Relations Board v. J. G. Bos-
well Co., C.C.A.9, 136 F.2d 585, 590, 592, 596. Anti-union
statements made by employer's supervisory employees dur-
ing and after strike, together with statement to one of the
strikers that he would never get a job in that town any-
more. N. L. R. B. v. Indiana Desk Co., C.C.A.7, 149 F.2d
987, 992, 996. Refusal of employer to permit posting of a
notice that employer would not discriminate against em-
ployees who wished to join union. National Labor Rela-
tions Board v. J. G. Boswell Co., C.C.A.9, 136 F.2d 585, 590,
592, 596. Discharge of an employee because of membership
in or activity on behalf of a labor organization. National
Labor Relations Board v. Newark Morning Ledger, C.C.A.
3, 120 F.2d 262, 268; National Labor Relations Board v.
Bank of America Trust & Savings Ass'n, C.C.A.9, 130 F.2d

262; National Labor Relations Board v. Stackpole Carbon
Co., C.C.A.3, 105 F.2d 167, 173, 175. Refusal of employer
which had refused to bargain with union which had been

F.2d 553, 558. Assault by persons employed by manufac-
turer upon union organizers or sympathizers. National
Labor Relations Board v. Ford Motor Co., C.C.A.6, 114 F.2d
905, 911, 915. Discharge of employee because he would
not become member of union in accordance with closed
shop agreement. Virginia Electric & Power Co. v. National
Labor Relations Board, C.C.A.4, 132 F.2d 390, 396.

## UNFAIR METHODS OF COMPETITION

This
phrase within Federal Trade Commission Act has
broader meaning than common-law term "unfair
competition," but its scope cannot be precisely
defined, and what constitutes "unfair methods of
competition" must be determined in particular in-
stances, upon evidence, in light of particular com-
petitive conditions and of what is found to be a
specific and substantial public interest. Federal
Trade Commission Act § 5, 15 U.S.C.A. § 45. A.L.
A. Schechter Poultry Corporation v. United States,
N.Y., 55 S.Ct. 837, 844, 295 U.S. 495, 79 L.Ed. 1570,
97 A.L.R. 947.
The term though not defined by the statute is clearly in-
applicable to practices never heretofore regarded as op-
posed to good morals because characterized by deception,
bad faith, fraud, or oppression, or as against public policy
because of their dangerous tendency unduly to hinder com-
petition or create monopoly.. The act was not intended to
fetter free and fair competition as commonly understood
and practiced by honorable opponents in trade. In re
Amtorg Trading Corporation, Cust & Pat.App., 75 F.2d
826, 830. But a method was said to be an unfair method
if it does not leave to each actual or potential competitor
a fair opportunity for play of his contending force en-
gendered by an honest desire for gain. California Rice In-
dustry v. Federal Trade Commission, C.C.A.9, 102 F.2d
716, 721.

## UNFAIR TRADE, DOCTRINE OF

The doctrine
that one person has no right to sell goods as goods
of another, nor to do other business as the busi-
ness of another. Foster Canning Co. v. Lardan
Packing Co., Sup., 17 N.Y.S.2d 583, 585.

## UNFAITHFUL

Characterized by bad faith,—
not synonymous with "illegal," which means un-
lawful or contrary to law, nor with "improper,"
which, as applied to conduct, implies such conduct
as a man of ordinary and reasonable prudence
would not, under the circumstances, have been
guilty of. State v. American Surety Co. of New
York, 26 Idaho 652, 145 P. 1097, 1104, Ann.Cas.
1916E, 209.

## UNFINISHED

Not completed; not brought to
an end; imperfect; the last effort, as a final touch
is given to a work. Bell & Graddy v. O'Brien, Tex.
Civ.App., 113 S.W.2d 560, 562.

## UNFIT

Unsuitable, incompetent, not adapted or
qualified for a particular use or service, having no
fitness. Morse v. Caldwell, 55 Ga.App. 804, 191
S.E. 479, 488.

## UNFIT FOR USE AS A BEVERAGE

This lan-
guage in a statute is not necessarily applicable to
an alcoholic compound or preparation merely be-
cause it may be drunk in sufficient quantities to
produce death. Thamann v. Merritt, 111 Neb. 639,
197 N.W. 413, 414.

## UNFORESEEN

Not foreseen, not expected.
Pampel v. Board of Examiners, 114 Mont. 380, 136
P.2d 991, 994.

## UNFORESEEN CAUSE

With reference to caus-
es excusing delay, under the Workmen's Compen-
sation Act, in giving notice of injury, a cause
which could not have been reasonably foreseen
as likely to arise or occur, and yet is of such a
nature as to have substantially interfered with
the giving of the notice. Wardwell's Case, 121 Me.
216, 116 A. 447, 448. A reasonable cause. Don-
ahue v. R. A. Sherman's Sons Co., 39 R.I. 373, 98
A. 109, L.R.A. 1917A, 76.

## UNFORESEEN EVENT

In the civil law. A vis
major; an uncontrollable force;—so used in Civ.
Code La. art. 2697, relating to the termination of a
lease by the total destruction of the property.
Knapp v. Guerin, 144 La. 754, 81 So. 302, 305.

## UNGELD

In Saxon law An outlaw; a person
whose murder required no composition to be
made, or weregeld to be paid, by his slayer.

## UNHARMED

Within provision of Federal Kid-
napping Act that death sentence shall not be im-
posed if kidnapped person has been liberated un-
harmed, means uninjured. Federal Kidnapping
Act § 1 et seq., as amended, 18 U.S.C.A. § 1201 et
seq. Robinson v. U. S., Ky., 65 S.Ct. 666, 668, 324
U.S. 282, 89 L.Ed. 944.

## UNIATE CHURCH

One united with Rome and
subject to control by local ecclesiastical authority
representing the Vatican. Drozda v. Bassos, 260
App.Div. 408, 23 N.Y.S.2d 544, 547.

## UNICA TAXATIO

The obsolete language of a
special award of venire, where, of several defend-
ants, one pleads, and one lets judgment go by de-
fault, whereby the jury, who are to try and assess
damages on the issue, are also to assess damages
against the defendant suffering judgment by de-
fault. Wharton.

## UNIFACTORAL OBLIGATION

See Contract.

## UNIFIED

Made one. Adams v. Salt River Val-
ley Water Users' Ass'n, 53 Ariz. 374, 89 P.2d 1060.

## UNIFORM

Within the meaning of an ordi-
nance requiring a traction company to give free
transportation to members of the police force and
fire department when in uniform, a plain clothes
man, whose only prescribed uniform was a metal
badge which might be worn concealed, while wear-
ing such badge was "in uniform." Montgomery
Light & Traction Co. v. Avant, 202 Ala. 404, 80 So.
497, 498, 3 A.L.R. 384.
UNIFORM, adj. Conforming to one rule, mode,
or unvarying standard; not different at different
times or places; applicable to all places or divi-
sions of a country. People v. Vickroy, 266 Ill. 384,
107 N.E. 638, 640. Equable; applying alike to all
within a class. Bufkin v. Mitchell, 106 Miss. 253,
63 So. 458, 459, 50 L.R.A.,N.S., 428.
A statute is general and uniform in its opera-
tion when it operates equally upon all persons
who are brought within the relations and circum-
stances provided for, McAunich v. Mississippi &
M. R. Co., 20 Iowa, 342. Stevens v. Village of
Nashwauk, 161 Minn. 20, 200 N.W. 927, 929, when
all persons under the same conditions and in the
same circumstances are treated alike, and classifi-
cation is reasonable and naturally inherent in the
subject-master. Kelly v. Finney, 207 Ind. 557, 194
N.E. 157, 166.
The words "general" and "uniform" as applied to laws
have a meaning antithetical to special or discriminatory
laws. Ex parte Nowak, 184 Cal. 701, 195 P. 402, 404. The
term "uniform," however, does not mean universal. Wat-
son v. G.eely, 67 Cal.App. 328, 227 P. 664, 670.
The burdens of taxation, to be uniform, must
have the essential of equality, and must bear alike
upon all the property within the limits of the
unit wherein it is lawful to levy taxes for a pur-
pose, whether that unit be the state, county, or a
municipality. Lang v. Commonwealth, 190 Ky. 29,
226 S.W. 379, 382. See, also, Jordan v. Duval Coun-
ty, 68 Fla. 48, 66 So. 298, 299. And requirement
is met when tax is equal on all persons belonging
to descibed class on which tax is imposed. Hilton
v. Harris, 207 N.C. 465, 177 S.E. 411.
With reference to locality, a tax is "uniform" when it
operates with equal force and effect in every place where
the subject of it is found, and with reference to classifica-
tion, it is uniform when it operates without distinction or
discrimination upon all persons composing the described
class. Hart v. Board of Comrs. of Burke County, 192
N.C. 161, 134 S.E. 403, 405; City of Cape Girardeau v.
Fred A. Groves Motor Co., 346 Mo. 762, 142 S.W.2d 1040,
UNIFORM LAWS. A considerable number of
laws have been approved by the National Con-
ference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws,
and many of them have been adopted in one or
more jurisdictions in the United States and its
possessions. Among the more important of these
laws are the Uniform Negotiable Instruments Act
which has been adopted in all the states as well
as in the District of Columbia, Alaska, Hawaii, the
Philippine Islands, and Porto Rico; the Uniform
Sales Act, which in 1950 had been adopted in 37
jurisdictions; the Uniform Bills of Lading Act,
in 32 jurisdictions; the Uniform Stock Transfer
Act, in all the states as well as in the District of
Columbia, Alaska and Hawaii; and the Uniform.
Partnership Act, in 32. Others which may be men-
,
tioned include the Uniform Warehouse Receipts,
Declaratory Judgments, Fiduciaries, Fraudulent
Conveyance, Desertion and Nonsupport, Veterans'
Guardianship, Conditional Sales and Limited Part-
nership Acts.

## UNIFORMITY

Conformity to one pattern; same-
ness. Naill v. Order of United Commercial Travel-
ers of America, 103 Okl. 179, 229 P. 833, 837.
"Uniformity of operation" of laws does not require "uni-
versality of operation." The former term relates to
similarity of conditions affecting subjects or localities of
the state that are appropriately classified. The latter term
relates to the whole and every part of the state. State
v. Daniel, 87 Fla. 270, 99 So. 804, 809.
The constitutional requirement of "uniformity" is com-
plied with when the law operates uniformly upon all per-
sons brought within the relations and circumstances provid-
ed by it. Abbott v. Commissioners of Roads and Revenues
of Fulton County, 160 Ga. 657, 129 S.E. 38, 41.
Uniformity in taxation implies equality in the
burden of taxation, which cannot exist without
uniformity in the mode of assessment, as well as
in the rate of taxation. Further, the uniformity
must be coextensive with the territory to which
it applies. And it must be extended to all prop-
erty subject to taxation, so that all property may
be taxed alike and equally. Exchange Bank v.
Hines, 3 Ohio St. 15. And see Edye v. Robertson,
5 S.Ct. 247, 112 U.S. 580, 28 L.Ed. 798; People v.
Auditor General, 7 Mich. 90; Hilger v. Moore, 56
Mont. 146, 182 P. 477, 481. Department of Justice
v. A. Overholt and Co., 331 Pa. 182, 200 A. 849,
The rule of "uniformity" does not require that all sub-
jects be taxed, nor taxed alike, but is complied with when
the tax is levied equally and uniformly on all subjects of
the same class and kind. Sims v. Ahrens, 167 Ark. 557, 271
S. W. 720, 729. The uniformity required in taxation is
limited to a uniformity in rate, assessment, and valuation
of the particular tax involved, and has no reference to a
uniformity of the sum total of taxes which a citizen is re-
quired to pay. King v. Sullivan County, 128 Tenn. 393,
160 S.W. 847, 848, and does not require uniformity of col-
lection, but only uniformity of assessment. Mississippi
State Tax Commission v. Flora Drug Co., 167 Miss. 1, 148
So. 373, 378.
Uniformity in taxation means equality in burden and not
equality in method. Ewert v. Taylor, 38 S.D. 124, 160 N.
W. 797, 803.

## UNION-JACK

The national flag of Great Brit-
ain and Ireland, which combines the banner of St.
Patrick with the crosses of St. George and St.
Andrew. The word "jack" is most probably de-
rived from the surcoat, charged with a red cross,
anciently used by the English soldiery. This ap-
pears to have been called a "jacque," whence the
word "jacket," anciently written "jacquit." Some,
however, without a shadow of evidence, derive
the word from "Jacques," the first alteration hav-
ing been made in the reign of King James I.
Wharton.

## UNION MORTGAGE CLAUSE

A clause, as in a
fire policy (together with the rider making the
loss, if any, payable to the mortgagee), which
provides that if the policy is made payable to a
mortgagee of the insured real estate, no act or
default of any person other than such mortgagee,
or his agents or those claiming under him, shall
affect his right to recover in case of loss on such
real estate. Bankers' Joint Stock Land Bank of
Milwaukee, Wis., v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins.
Co., 158 Minn. 363, 197 N.W. 749. Prudential Ins.
Co. of America v. German Mut. Fire Ins. Ass'n of
Lohman, 231 Mo.App. 699, 105 S.W.2d 1001.
Such clause creates independent contract between in-
surer and mortgagee. Conard v. Moreland, 230 Iowa 520,
298 N.W. 628, 629. And is distinguished from "open mort-
gage clause" in that latter clause simply provides that
policy is payable to mortgagee as his interest may ap-
pear. Prudential Ins. Co. of America v. German Mut.
Fire Ins. Ass'n of Lohman, 231 Mo.App. 699, 105 S.W.2d

er is permitted to employ a non-union worker, but such
worker is required to join the union as a requisite to his
continuing work. And that it is distinguished from
"closed shop" where the worker must be a member of
the union as a condition precedent to his employment.

vestment security. State v. Summerland, 150
Minn. 266, 185 N.W. 255, 256.

## UNIT CF PRODUCTION

The "unit of produc-
tion" method of determining the taxable net in-
come or profit in the oil or gas business is ac-
complished by a system of accounting by which is
ascertained, as nearly as science will permit, the
total amount of recoverable oil in the property,
and to each barrel of this oil is assigned its part
of the capital investment, and from the sale price
of each barrel produced and sold there is deducted
the expenses of producing it, and its proportion of
the capital investment, leaving the balance as
profit, and thus, when the property is exhausted,
the operator has received back his capital and ex-
penses, and accounted for his net income or loss.
Carter v. Phillips, 88 Okl. 202, 212 P. 747, 750.

the same as those of justices of the peace in fel-
ony offenses against laws of state, is not a judge
or court, and does not hold court, but is an ad-
junct of court, possessing independent, though
subordinate, judicial powers of his own. U. S. v.
Napela, D.C.N.Y., 28 F.2d 898, 899.

## UNITED STATES COURTS

Except in the case
of impeachments the judicial power of the United
States is vested by the Constitution in a supreme
court and such other inferior courts as may be
from time to time established by congress. All
the judges are appointed by the president, with
the advice and consent of the senate, to hold of-
fice during good behavior, and their compensation
cannot be diminished during their terms of office.
The judges, other than those of the supreme
court, are circuit judges and district judges. The
circuit judges compose the courts of appeals and
the district judges hold the district courts, and
also at times sit in the circuit courts of appeal.
For a detailed statement of the territorial bound-
aries of the several districts and divisions of dis-
tricts, see 28 U.S.C.A. § 81 et seq. and various spe-
cial acts.

cial district to appoint such number of persons, to be
known as United States commissioners, at such places in

Rev.St.U.S. § 627 (28 USCA § 631). Austill v. United
States, 58 Ct.C1. 232; United States v. Maresca, D.C.N.Y.,
266 F. 713.
In statutes, the words "court of the district", Prieto v.
U. S. Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation, 117
Misc. 703, 193 N.Y.S. 342, and "courts of the United
States," are commonly deemed to refer to federal courts
and not to state courts. General Inv. Co. v. Lake Shore &
M. S. Ry. Co., C.C.A.Ohio, 269 F. 235, 237.

## UNITED STATES CURRENCY

derstood to include every form of currency au-

sembling bank-notes, issued by the government of
the United States.

## UNITY

In the law of estates. The peculiar
tenancy, and which is fourfold, viz., unity of in-
terest, unity of title, unity of time, and unity of
possession. In other words, joint tenants have
one and the same interest, accruing by one and
the same conveyance, commencing at one and
the same time, and held by one and the same un-
divided possession. 2 Bl. Comm. 180.

## UNITY OF INTEREST

Required in case of joint
tenancy means that interests must accrue by one
and same conveyance. Hernandez v. Becker, C.C.
A.N.M., 54 F.2d 542, 547. It also signifies that
no one of joint tenants can have a greater in-
terest in the property than each of the others,
while, in the case of tenants in common, one of
them may have a larger share than any of the
(others. Williams, Real Prop. 134, 139.

## UNITY OF POSSESSION

Joint possession of
two rights by several titles. As if I take a lease
,of land from a person at a certain rent, and after-
wards I buy the fee-simple of such land, by this
I acquire unity of possession, by which the lease
is extinguished. Cowell; Brown. It is also one
of the essential properties of a joint estate, requir-
ing that the joint tenants must hold the same
undivided possession of the whole and enjoy same
rights until death of one. Hernandez v. Becker,
C.C.A.N.M., 54 F.2d 542, 547.

## UNITY OF SEISIN

Where a person seised of
land which is subject to an easement, profit a
p'rendre, or similar right, also becomes seised of
the land to which the easement or other right is
annexed. Sweet.

## UNITY OF TIME

One of the essential proper-
ties of a joint estate; the estates of the tenants
being vested at one and the same period. 2 Bl.
Comm. 181; Hernandez v. Becker, C.C.A.N.M., 54
F.2d 542, 547.

## UNITY OF TITLE

Applied to joint tenants, sig-
nifies that they hold their property by one and
the same title, while tenants in common may take
property by several titles. Williams, Real Prop.
Legal requirements of easement of "right of way of
necessity" are unity of title, by which is meant that own-
er of dominant estate must show that his land and that
of owner of servient estate once belonged to same person,
severance of title, and necessity. Brasington v. Williams,
143 S.C. 223, 141 S.E. 375, 382.

## UNIUS OMNINO TESTIS RESPONSIO NON AU- DIATUR

The answer of one witness shall not be
heard at all; the testimony of a single witness
shall not be admitted under any circumstances.
A maxim of the civil and canon law. Cod. 4, 20,
9; 3 Bl. Comm. 370; Best, Ev. p. 426, § 390, and
note.

## UNIUSCUJUSQUE CONTRACTUS INITIUM SPECTANDUM EST, ET CAUSA

The com-
mencement and cause of every contract are to be
regarded. Dig. 17, 1, 8; Story, Bailm. § 56.

## UNIVERSAL

Having relation to the whole or an
entirety; pertaining to all without exception; a
term more extensive than "general," which latter
may admit of exceptions. See Blair v. Howell, 68
Iowa, 619, 28 N.W. 199; Koen v. State, 35 Neb.
676, 53 N.W. 595, 17 L.R.A. 821.

erally, a whole of things. Several single things,

## UNJUST ENRICHMENT, DOCTRINE OF

Doc-
trine that person shall not be allowed to profit or
enrich himself inequitably at anothes expense.
American University v. Forbes, 88 N.H. 17, 183 A.
860, 862. Under this doctrine a defendant has
something of value at the plaintiff's expense un-
der circumstances which impose a legal duty of
restitution. Herrmann v. Gleason, C.C.A.Mich.,
126 F.2d 936, 940. Doctrine permits recovery in
certain instances where person has received from
another a benefit retention of which would be un-
just. Seekins v. King, 66 R.I. 105, 17 A.2d 869,
871, 134 A.L.R. 1060. Doctrine is not contractual
but is equitable in nature. State v. Martin, 59
Ariz. 438, 130 P.2d 48, 52.
"Unjust enrichment" of a person occurs when he has
and retains money or benefits which in justice and equity
belong to another. Hummel v. Hummel, 133 Ohio St. 520,
14 N.E.2d 923, 927. Thus one who has conferred a benefit
upon another solely because of a basic mistake of fact
induced by a nondisclosure is entitled to restitution on
above doctrine. Conkling's Estate v. Champlin, 193 Okl.
79, 141 P.2d 569, 570.

inadmissible who was not worth the king's unlaw;
i. e., the sum of £10 Scots, then the common fine
for absence from court and for small delinquen-
cies. Bell.

## UNLAWFUL

That which is contrary to law or
unauthorized by law. State v. Chenault, 20 N.M.
181, 147 P. 283, 285. That which is not lawful.
State v. Bulot, 175 La. 21, 142 So. 787, 788. The
acting contrary to, or in defiance of the law; dis-
obeying or disregarding the law. While neces-
sarily not implying the element of criminality, it
is broad enough to include it. Sturgeon v. Cros-
by Mortuary, 140 Neb. 82, 299 N.W. 378, 383.
"Unlawful" and "illegal" are frequently used as synony-
mous terms, but, in the proper sense of the word, "un-
lawful," as applied to promises, agreements, considera-
tions, and the like, denotes that they are ineffectual in
law because they involve acts which, although not illegal,
i. e., positively forbidden, are disapproved of by the law,
and are therefore not recognized as the ground of legal
are against public policy. It is on this ground that con-
tracts in restraint of marriage or of trade are generally
void. Sweet. And see Hagerman v. Buchanan, 45 isT.J.Eq.
292, 17 A. 946, 14 Am.St.Rep. 732; Tatum v. State, 66
Ala. 467. People v. Chicago Gas Trust Co., 130 Ill. 268, 22
N.E. 798, 8 L.R.A. 497, 17 Am.St.Rep. 319.

## UNLAWFUL ACT

Act contrary to law, and pre-
supposes that there must be an existing law.
State v. Campbell, 217 Iowa 848, 251 N.W. 717, 92
A.L.R. 1176.
In criminal jurisprudence, a violation of some
prohibitory law and includes all willful, actionable
violations of civil rights, and is not confined to
criminal acts. State v. Hailey, 350 Mo. 300, 165
S.W.2d 422, 427.
The "unlawful acts" within manslaughter statutes con-
sist of reckless conduct or conduct evincing marked dis-
regard for safety of others. State v. Newton, 105 Utah 561,
144 P.2d 290, 293; State v. Thatcher, 108 Utah 63, 157 P.2d
258, 261.

## UNLAWFUL ASSEMBLY

At common law. The
meeting together of three or more persons, to the
disturbance of the public peace, and with the in-
tention of co-operating in the forcible and violent
execution of some unlawful private enterprise.
If they take steps towards the performance of
their purpose, it becomes a rout; and, if they put
their design into actual execution, it is a riot. 4
Bl. Comm. 146. To constitute offense it must apr
pear that there was common intent of persons as-
sembled to attain purpose, whether lawful or un-
lawful, by commission of acts of intimidation and
disorder likely to produce danger to peace of
neighborhood, and actually tending to inspire
courageous persons with well-grounded fear of
serious breaches of public peace. State v. Butter-
worth, 104 N.J.L. 579, 142 A. 57, 60, 58 A.L.R. 744.
Three or more persons who assemble peaceably without

original entry was lawful and of right, but whose
right to the possession has terminated and who

of a demand for possession by the landlord. Mc-
Devitt v. Lambert, 80 Ala. 536, 2 So. 438; Silva
v. Campbell, 84 Cal. 420, 24 Pac. 316; Brandley v.
Lewis, 97 Utah 217, 92 P.2d 338, 339.
Actions of "unlawful detainer" concern only right of
possession of realty, and differ from ejectment in that no
ultimate question of title or estate can be determined.
McCracken v. Wright, 159 Kan.- 615, 157 P.2d 814, 817.
Where an entry upon lands is unlawful, whether forcible
or not, and the subsequent conduct is forcible and tor-
tainer;" but where the original entry is lawful, and the
subsequent holding forcible and tortious, the offense is an
"unlawful detainer" only. Pullen v. Boney, 4 N.J.L. 129.

## UNLAWFUL ENTRY

fected peaceably and without force, but which is

Massey, 97 N.C. 465, 2 S.E. 445.
This word is frequently used in indictments in the de-
scription of the offence; it is necessary when the crime
did not exist at common law, and when a statute, in de-
scribing an offence which it creates, uses the word; 1
Mood.C.C. 339; but is unnecessary whenever the crime
existed at common law and is manifestly illegal; 1 Chit.
Cr.L. *241.

## UNLESS

tled; as unliquidated damages; Davies v. Turner,
61 Ga.App. 531, 6 S.E.2d 356, 358.
A debt is spoken of as "unliquidated," if the amount
thereof cannot be ascertained at the trial by a mere com-
putation, based on the terms of the obligation or on some
other accepted standard. Hettrick Mfg. Co. v. Barish, 120
Misc. 673, 199 N.Y.S. 755, 767.
Under the law of accord and satisfaction, a claim or
debt will be regarded as unliquidated if it is in dispute as

An unloading clause in an automobile liability policy
covers the entire process involved in the movement of ar-
ticles by and from a motor vehicle to the place where
they are turned over to the one to whom the insured is
to make delivery, if the clause is construed in accordance
with what may be called the "complete operation" rule.
Pacific Auto. Ins. Co. v. Commercial Cas. Ins. Co. of N.
Y., 161 P.2d 423, 108 Utah 500, 160 A.L.R. 1251. There
are, however, two other rules or doctrines used by vari-
ous courts in applying the unloading clause of such a
policy. One is known as the "coming to rest" rule, and
the other is the "continuous passage" rule. Blashfield,
Cyc. of Automobile Law and Prac., Perm. Ed., § 3972.5.
But the complete operation rule is said to be the modern
doctrine, supported by the trend of the later cases. Lon-
don Guarantee & Acc. Co. v. C. B. White & Bros., 49
S.E.2d 254, 188 Va. 195.

UNMARKETABLE TITLE. When for vendee to
accept title proffered would lay him open to fair
probability of vexatious litigation with possibility
of serious loss. Schoenberg v. O'Connor, 14 N.J.
Misc. 412, 185 A. 377, 381. It being sufficient to
render it so if ordinarily prudent man with knowl-
edge of the facts and aware of legal questions in-
of business but title need not be bad in fact; Bar-
rett v. McMannis, 153 Kan. 420, 110 P.2d 774, 777,
778; Ayers v. Graff, 153 Kan. 209, 109 P.2d 202,

467, 470.
Where some defect of substantial character exists and
facts are known which fairly raise reasonable doubt as
to title. Schul v. Clapp, 154 Kan. 372, 118 P.2d 570, 574.
And mere quibbles and pecadilloes which the ingenuity of
counsel can raise against a title do not render it an "un-
marketable title". Barrett v. McMannis, 153 Kan. 420, 110
P.2d 774, 778.

## UNMARRIED

Its primary meaning is never
having been married; but it is a word of flexible
meaning and it may be construed as not having a
husband or wife at the time in question. 9 H.L.
Cas. 601; People v. Weinstock, Mag.Ct., 140 N.Y.S.
453, 458.
A divorced woman has been held an unmarried woman.

## UNNECESSARY HARDSHIP

Within zoning or-
dinance so as to authorize granting of variance
on such ground if land cannot yield a reasonable
return if used only for a purpose allowed in zone,
the plight of owner is due to unique circumstances
not to general conditions in the neighborhood and
use to be authorized will not alter essential char-
acter of the locality. Calcagno v. Town Board of
Town of Webster, 265 App.Div. 687, 41 N.Y.S.2d
140, 142.
It has also been said that test whether terms of zoning
ordinance impose an "unnecessary hardship". depends on
whether use restriction is so unreasonable as to constitute
an arbitrary interference with basic right of private prop-
erty. Scaduto v. Town of Bloomfield, 127 N.J.L. 1, 20 A.2d
649, 650.

Within fire policy exempting in-
surer from liability in case dwelling is "unoccu-

ordinary purposes of a dwelling or place of abode,
habitual stoppage. Vinton v. Atlas Assur, Co.,
107 Vt. 272, 178 A. 909, 911. Hence a mere tem-
porary absence of occupants of dwelling house
from such premises, with intention to return
thereto does not render dwelling "unoccupied".
Foley v. Sonoma County Farmers' Mut. Fire Ins.

submit to an operation is unreasonable, so as to
deprive him of right to workmen's compensation
if it appears that an operation of a simple charac-

Star Coal Co. v. Surgener, 297 Ky. 653, 181 S.W.2d
53, 54.

town. Sometimes it is put for civitas, and de-
notes the inhabitants, or both the city and its in-
habitants; i. e., the municipality or common-
wealth. By way of special pre-eminence, urbs
meant the city of Rome. Ainsworth.

## URE

L. Fr. Effect; practice. Mis en ure, put
in practice; carried into effect. Kelham.

## USAGE

A reasonable and lawful public custom
in a locality concerning particular transactions
which is either known to the parties, or so well
established, general, and uniform that they must
be presumed to have acted with reference there-
to. Milroy v. Railway Co., 98 Iowa 188, 67 N.W.
276; Barnard v. Kellogg, 10 Wall. 388, 19 L.Ed.
987; Barreda v. Milmo Nat. Bank, Tex.Civ.App.,
241 S.W. 743, 745. Gerseta Corporation v. Silk
Ass'n of America, 220 App.Div. 293, 222 N.Y.S. 11,
13. Practice in fact. Electrical Research Prod-
ucts v. Gross, C.C.A.Alaska, 120 F.2d 301, 305.
Uniform practice or course of conduct followed in
certain lines of business or professions or some
procedure or phase thereof. Turner v. Donovan,
3 Cal.App.2d 485, 39 P.2d 858, 859.
"Usage" cannot be proved by isolated instances, but
must be certain, uniform and notorious. Unkovich v. New
York Cent. R. Co., 128 N.J.Eq. 377, 16 A.2d 558, 561. It
is distinguished from "custom" in that "usage" derives its
efficacy from assent of parties to transaction, and hence
is important only in consensual agreements, while "cus-
tom" derives its efficacy from its adoption into the law, is
binding irrespective of any manifestation of assent by
parties concerned, and may be of importance in any de-
partment of law. Gulf Refining Co. v. Universal Ins. Co.,
C.C.A.N.Y., 32 F.2d 555, 557.
"Usage," in French law, is the "uses" of Roman law,
and corresponds very nearly to the tenancy at will or on
sufferance of English law. Brown.
"Usage," in its most extensive meaning, includes both
custom and prescription; but, in its narrower signification,
the term refers to a general habit, mode, or course of pro-
cedure. A usage differs from a custom, in that it does not
require that the usage should be immemorial to establish
it; but the usage must be known, certain, uniform, rea-
sonable, and not contrary to law. Lowry v. Read, 3
Brewst. (Pa.) 452.
Fair Usage
General Usage
One which prevails generally throughout the
country, or is followed generally by a given pro-
fession or trade, and is not local in its nature or
observance.
Usage of Trade
A course of dealing; a mode of conducting
transactions of a particular kind. Haskins V.
Warren, 115 Mass. 535. A mode of dealing gen-
erally observed in a particular trade. United
States v. Stanolind Crude Oil Purchasing Co., C.
C.A.Okl., 113 F.2d 194, 200; Codd v. Westchester
Fire Ins. Co., 14 Wash.2d 600, 128 P.2d 968, 973.

## USANCE

In mercantile law. The common per-
iod fixed by the usage or custom or habit of deal-
ing between the country where a bill is drawn,
and that where it is payable, for the payment of
bills of exchange. It means, in some countries,
a month, in others two or more months, and in
others half • a month. Story, Bills, H 50, 144, 332.

## USE

To make use of, to convert to one's serv-
ice, to avail one's self of, to employ. Hopkins v.
Howard's Ex'x, 266 Ky. 685, 99 S.W.2d 810, 812.
To leave no capacity of force or use in. Bridge-
port Mach. Co. v. McKnab, 136 Kan. 781, 18 P.2d
186, 187.

## USE

Act of employing everything, or state of
being employed; application; employment, as the
use of a pen, or his machines are in use. Also the
fact of being used or employed habitually; usage,
as, the wear and tear resulting from ordinary use.
Berry-Kofron Dental Laboratory Co. v. Smith, 345
Mo. 922, 137 S.W.2d 452, 454, 455, 456. The pur-
pose served, a purpose, object or end for useful
or advantageous nature. Brown v. Kennedy, Ohio
App., 49 N.E.2d 417, 418.
A confidence reposed in another, who was made
tenant of the land, or terre-tenant, that he would
dispose of the land according to the intention of
the cestui que use, or him to whose use it was
granted, and suffer him to take the profits. 2 Bl.
Comm. 328.
A right in one person, called the "cestui que
use," to take the profits of land of which another
has the legal title and possession, together with
the duty of defending the same, and of making
estates thereof according to the direction of the
cestui que use. Bouvier.
Uses and trusts are not so much different things as dif-
ferent aspects of the same subject. A use regards prin-
cipally the beneficial interest; a trust regards principally
the nominal ownership. The usage of the two terms is,
however, widely different. The word "use" is employed
to denote either an estate vested since the statute of uses,
and by force of that statute, or to denote such an estate
created before the statute as, had it been created since,
would have become a legal estate by force of the statute.
The word "trust" is employed since that statute to denote
the relation between the party invested with the legal es-
tate (whether by force of that statute or independently of
it) and the party beneficially entitled, who has hitherto
been said to have the equitable estate. Mozley & Whiteley.
Civil Law
A right of receiving so much of the natural prof-
It differs from "usufruct," which is a right not
only to use, but to enjoy. 1 Browne, Civil & Adm.
Law, 184.
Right given to any one to make a gratuitous
use of a thing belonging to another, or to exact
such a portion of the fruit it produces as is nec-
essary for his personal wants and those of his
family. Civ.Code La. art. 626.
Conveyancing
"Use" literally means "benefit;" thus, in an
ordinary assignment of chattels, the assignor
transfers the property to the assignee for his "ab-
solute use and benefit." In the expressions "sepa-
rate use," "superstitious use," and "charitable
use," "use" has the same meaning Sweet.
Non-technical Sense
The "use" of a thing means that one is to en-
joy, hold, occupy, or have some manner of benefit
thereof. Bryson v. Hicks, 78 Ind.App. 111, 134 N.E.
874, 875. Use also means usefulness, utility, ad-
vantage, productive of benefit. Williams v. City of
Norman, 85 Oki. 230, 205 P. 144, 148; National
Surety Co. v. Jarrett, 95 W.Va. 420, 121 S.E. 291,
295, 36 A.L.R. 1171.
General
Cestui que use. A person for whose use and
.
benefit lands or tenements are held by another.
The latter, before the statute of uses, was called
the "feoffee to use," and held the nominal or legal
title.
Charitable use. See Charitable.
Contingent use. A use limited to take effect
upon the happening of some future contingent
event; as where lands are conveyed to the use of
A. and B., after a marriage shall be had between
them. 2 Bl.Comm. 334; Haywood v. Shreve, 44
N.J.L. 94; Jemison v. Blowers, 5 Barb. (N.Y.)
Exclusive use. See Exclusive Use.
Executed use. The first use in a conveyance
upon which the statute of uses operates by bring-
ing the possession to it, the combination of which,
e., the use and the possession, form the legal
estate, and thus the statute is said to execute the
use. Wharton.
Executory uses. These are springing uses,
which confer a legal title answering to an execu-
tory devise; as when a limitation to the use of A.
in fee is defeasible by a limitation to the use of
B., to arise at a future period, or on a given event.
Existing use. See Existing Use.
Feoffee to uses. A person to whom (before the
statute of uses) land was conveyed "for the use"
of a third person. He held the nominal or legal
title, while the third person, called the "cestui
que use," was entitled to the beneficial enjoyment
Official use. An active use before the statute of
uses, which imposed some duty on the legal owner
or feoffee to uses; as a conveyance to A. with
directions for him to sell the estate and distribute
the proceeds among B., C., and D. To enable A.
to perform this duty, he had the legal possession
of the estate to be sold. Wharton.
Passive use. A permissive use (q. v.).
Permissive use. A passive use which was re-
sorted to before the statute of uses, in order to
avoid a harsh law; as that of mortmain or a feu-
dal forfeiture. It was a mere invention in order
to evade the law by secrecy; as a conveyance to
A. to the .use of B. A. simply held the possession,
and B. enjoyed the profits of the estate. Wharton.
Resulting use. A use raised by equity for the
benefit of a feoffor who has made a voluntary con-
veyance to uses without any declaration of the
use. 2 Washb.Real Prop. 100. A resulting use
arises where the legal seisin is transferred, and
no use is expressly declared, nor any considera-
tion or evidence of intent to direct the use. The
use then remains in the original grantor, for it
cannot be supposed that the estate was intended to
be given away; and the statute immediately trans-
fers the legal estate to such resulting use. Whar-
ton.
Secondary use. A use limited to take effect in
derogation of a preceding estate, otherwise called
a "shifting use," as a conveyance to the use of A.
and his heirs, with a proviso that, when B. re-
turns from India, then to the use of C. and his
heirs. 1 Steph.Comm. 546.
Shifting use. A use which is so limited that it
will be made to shift or transfer itself, from one
beneficiary to another, upon the occurrence of a
certain event after its creation. For example,
an estate is limited to the use of A. and his heirs,
provided that, upon the return of B. from Rome,
it shall be to the use of C. and his heirs; this
is a shifting use, which transfers itself to C. when
the event happens. 1 Steph.Comm. 503; 2 Bi.
Comm. 335. These shifting uses are common in
all settlements; and, in marriage settlements, the
first use is always to the owner in fee till the mar-
riage, and then to other uses. The fee remains
with the owner until the marriage, and then it
shifts as uses arise. 4 Kent, Comm. 297.
Springing use. A use limited to arise on a
future event where no preceding use is limited,
and which does not take effect in derogation of
any other interest than that which results to the
grantor, or remains in him in the meantime. 2
Washb.Real.Prop. 281; Smith v. Brisson, 90 N.C.
Statute of uses. An English statute enacted in
1536, (27 Hen. VIII, c. 10,) directed against the
practice of creating uses in lands, and which con-
verted the purely equitable title of persons enti-
tled to a use into a legal title or absolute owner-
ship with right of possession. The statute is said
tervening estate of the feoffee to uses, and makes
the beneficial interest of the cestui que use an
absolute legal title. See Ohio & Colorado Smelt-
ing & Refining Co. v. Barr, 58 Colo. 116, 144 P. 552,
Superstitious uses. See that title.
Use and habitation. Within a grant does not
mean the exclusive use and habitation, but the ne-
cessities of the grantee are determinative of ex-
tent of privileges to be enjoyed. Barrett v. Bar-
rett, La.App., 5 So.2d 381, 383.
Use and occupation. This is the name of an ac-
tion, being a variety of assumpsit, to be main-
tained by a landlord against one who has had the
occupation and enjoyment of an estate, under a
contract to pay therefor, express or implied, but
not under such a lease as would support an action
specifically for rent. Thackray v. Ritz, 130 Misc.
403, 223 N.Y.S. 668, 669.
Use plaintiff. One for whose use (benefit) an
action is brought in the name of another. Thus,
where the assignee of a chose in action is not al-
lowed to sue in his own name, the action would be
entitled "A. B. (the assignor) for the Use of C. D.
(the assignee) against E. F." In this case, C. D.
is called the "use plaintiff."

## USED FOR ILLEGAL CONVEYING OF LIQ- UOR

Automobile is so used, if liquor is in or on
the car and is being intentionally conveyed by its
movements, though it is upon the person of an
occupant of the car while he is conveyed by it.
Morris v. State, 220 Ala. 418, 125 So. 655.

## USEE

A person for whose use a suit is brought;
otherwise termed the "use plaintiff."
USEFUL. The term as used in the patent law,
when applied to a machine, means that the ma-
chine will accomplish its purpose practically when
applied in industry. Besser v. Merrilat Culvert
Core Co., C.C.A.Iowa, 243 F. 611.
By "useful" is meant such an invention as may be ap-
plied to some beneficial use in society, in contradistinction
to an invention which is injurious to the morals, the
health, or the good order of society. Bedford v. Hunt, 1
Mason, 302, F.Cas.No.1,217.

## USEFULNESS

Capabilities for use. The word

chises.
Adverse User

so far as they conflict with this use. Blanchard
v. Moulton, 63 Me. 434; Murray v. Scribner, 74
Wis. 602, 43 N.W. 549; Thorworth v. Scheets, 269
Ill. 573, 110 N.E. 42, 45; Cummins v. Dumas, 147
USER DE ACTION. L. Fr. In old practice. The
pursuing or bringing an action. Cowell.

## USHER

This word is said to be derived from
"huissier," and is the name of a subordinate offi-
cer in some English courts of law. Archb.Pr. 25.

## USHER OF THE BLACK ROD

The gentleman
usher of the black rod is an officer of the house of
lords appointed by letters patent from the crown.
His duties are, by himself or deputy, to desire the
attendance of the commons in the house of peers
when the royal assent is given to bills, either by
the king in person or by commission, to execute
orders for the commitment of persons guilty of
breach of privilege, and also to assist in the in-
troduction of peers when they take the oaths and
their seats. Brown.

## USING MAIL TO DEFRAUD

The elements of
this offense are the formation of a scheme or
artifice to defraud, and use of mails for purpose of
executing or attempting to execute such scheme or
artifice; the latter element being gist of the of-
fense. 18 U.S.C.A. § 1341. Stryker v. United
States, C.C.A.Colo., 95 F.2d 601, 604, 605. The
crime is complete when mails are used in such
scheme, and what happened subsequently is not
controlling. United States v. Ames, D.C.N.Y., 39
F.Supp. 885, 886.
USING THE SERVICE OF ANOTHER FOR PAY.
This phrase as used in Compensation Act defining
employer means right to control the means and
manner of that service, as distinguished from re-
sults of such service, the word "service" meaning
the performance of labor for the benefit of anoth-
er. Rutherford v. Tobin Quarries, 336 Mo. 1171, 82
S.W.2d 918, 923.

## USO

right to air it has been held that ownership extends
"usque ad coelum." Romano v. Birmingham Ry. Light &
Power Co., 182 Ala. 335, 62 So. 677, 46 L.R.A.,N.S., 642,

trade or business, refer to normal operations con-
stituting regular business of employer. Long-
shoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation
Act, 33 U.S.C.A. §§ 901-950; D.C.Code 1929, T.
19, §§ 11, 12, 33 U.S.C.A. § 901 note. Hoage v.
Hartford Accident & Indemnity Co., 64 App.D.C.
258, 77 F.2d 381.

statute relating to service of process is place
where defendant is actually living at time of serv-
ice. State ex rel. Merritt v. Heffernan, 142 Fla.
496, 195 So. 145, 147, 127 A.L.R. 1263; Caskey v.

## USUARIUS

Lat. In the civil law. One who had
the mere use of a thing belonging to another for
the purpose of supplying his daily wants; a us-
uary. Dig. 7, 8, 10, pr.; Calvin.
USUCAPIO, or USUCAPTIO. A term of Roman
law used to denote a mode of acquisition of prop-
erty. It corresponds very nearly to the term "pre-
scription." But the prescription of Roman law
differed from that of the English law, in this: that
no mala fide possessor (i. e., person in possession
knowingly of the property of another) could, by
however long a period, acquire title by possession
merely. The two essential requisites to usucapio
were justa causa (i. e., title) and bona fides, (i. e.,
ignorance.) The term "usucapio" is sometimes,
but erroneously, written "usucaptio." Brown.
See Pavey v. Vance, 56 Ohio St. 162, 46 N.E. 898.
As to "lucrativa usucapio," see that title.

## USUCAPIO CONSTITUTA EST UT ALIQUIS LITIUM FINIS ESSET

Prescription was insti-
tuted that there might be some end to litigation.
Dig. 41, 10, 5; Broom, Max. 894, note.

## USUFRUCT

In the civil law. The right of en-
joying a thing, the property of which is vested in
another, and to draw from the same all the profit,
utility, and advantage which it may produce, pro-
vided it be without altering the substance of the
thing. Civ.Code La. art. 533. Mulford v. Le
Franc, 26 Cal. 102; Modern Music Shop v. Con-
cordia Fire Ins. Co. of Milwaukee, 131 Misc. 305,
226 N.Y.S. 630, 635.
Under Greek Law. A right attached to the per-
son which may not be inherited. New England
Trust Co. v. Wood, Mass., 93 N.E.2d 547, 549.
Imperfect Usufruct
An imperfect or quasi usufruct is that which is
of things which would be useless to the usufruc-
tuary if he did not consume or expend them or
change the substance of them; as, money, grain,
liquors. Civ.Code La. art. 534.
See Quasi Usufruct infra.
Legal Usufruct
See that title.
Perfect Usufruct
An usufruct in those things which the usufruc-
tuary can enjoy without changing their substance,
though their substance may be diminished or de-
teriorate naturally by time or by the use to which
they are applied, as, a house, a piece of land, fur-
niture, and other movable effects. Civ.Code La.
art. 534.
Quasi Usufruct
In the civil law. Originally the usufruct gave no
right to the substance of the thing, and conse-
quently none to its consumption; hence only an
inconsumable thing could be the object of it,
whether movable or immovable. But in later
times the right of usufruct was, by ar.alogy, ex-
tended to consumable things, and therewith arose
the distinction between true and quasi usufructs.
See Mackeld. Rom. Law, § 307; Civ.Code La. art.
534. See Imperfect Usufruct, supra.

## USUFRUCTUARY

In the civil law. One who
has the usufruct or right of enjoying anything in

Usury is a certain benefit which is received for
the use of a thing lent. But to have an under-
standing [literally, to breathe or whisper,] in an

performing duties of office upon claim of right thereto.
State ex rel. Kirk v. Wheatley, 133 Ohio St. 164, 12 N.E.2d
491, 493.

## USURPED POWER

In insurance. An invasion
from abroad, or an internal rebellion, where

"Usury" does not depend on question whether the lender
actually gets more than the legal rate of interest or not;
but on whether there was a purpose in his mind to make
more than legal interest for the use of money, and wheth-
er, by the terms of the transaction, and the means used to
effect the loan, he may by its enforcement be enabled to
get more than the legal rate. American Nat. Ins. Co. v.
Schenck, Tex.Civ.App., 85 S.W.2d 833, 837.

ment of land, corresponding with the right of habi-
tatio of houses, and being closely analogous to
the tenancy at sufferance or at will of English
law. The usuarius (i. e., tenant by usus) could
only hold on so long as the owner found him cons
venient, and had to go so soon as ever he was in
the owner's way, (molestus.) The usuarius could
not have a friend to share the produce. It was
scarcely permitted to him (Justinian says) to have
even his wife with him on the land; and he could
not let or sell, the right being strictly personal
to himself. Brown.

expressed the same sentiment. Adams, Rom.

tained. Emery Industries v. Schumann, C.C.A.I11., 111

The "utility" which an infringing defendant is estopped
to deny means sufficient practical utility to make a device
useful in the sense of the patent statute. The estoppel
does not forbid him to deny that there is any useful func-
tion, or new result serving to give inventive character to
the slight step which a patentee has taken in differentia-
tion from prior art. Sandy MacGregor Co. v. Vaco Grip

The "utmost care" which is required of a carrier of per-
sons for reward, means the highest degree of care, but
does not mean that in point of fact the same degree or
quantum of care should be applied in every case, since the
necessary degree of care varies with the dangers to be
anticipated by a man of the utmost degree of prudence
from the surrounding circumstances and conditions of each
case. Chicago, R. I. & P. Ry. Co. v. Shelton, 135' Okl. 53,
273 P. 988, 990.
