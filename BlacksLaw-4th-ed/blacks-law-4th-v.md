erence to an office temporarily filled. Futrell v. Oldham,

haunt customable taverns and ale-houses and routs about;
and no man wot from whence they came, nor whither
they go." 4 Bl.Comm. 169. See Forsyth v. Forsyth, 46

Va. 526, 103 S.E. 327, 328, 9 A.L.R. 1361. See Va-
grant.
Ordinarily, a course of conduct or manner of life, rather
than a single act, is necessary to give rise to charge of
"vagrancy". State v. Suman, 216 Minn. 293, 12 N.W.2d
620, 621.
Under some statutes, however, a single act may be suf-
ficient. 66 C.J. p. 401. Thus, it has been held that the
act of{ prowling about and creeping up on parked auto-
mobiles and their occupants at night, under circumstances
also been held that, although traveling by automobile, a
person may nevertheless be a vagrant, and, even though
he travels without stop or hesitation for a considerable
distance, he may still come within a statute punishing
one who "wanders about" at late hours. Blashfield, Cyc.
of Automobile Law and Prac., Perm. Ed., § 5528.84.

## VAGRANT

who is apt to become a public charge through his
own laziness. People, on Complaint of McDon-
ough, v. Gesino, Sp.Sess., 22 N.Y.S.2d 284, 285.
See Vagrancy.
A person who lives without employment is not a "va-
grant" if he has sufficient means belonging to himself or
means provided for him in a legitimate way. People v.
Banwer, Mag.Ct., 22 N.Y.S.2d 566, 569, 571.

## VALE

In Spanish law. A promissory note.

enable it to be recognized and enforced by law.
Thompson v. Town of Frostproof, 89 Fla. 92, 103
So. 118; United States v. McCutchen, D.C.Cal.,
234 F. 702, 709.

Meritorious; as a valid defense. Berringer v.
Stevens, 145 Ark. 293, 225 S.W. 14, 15.

## VALID REASON

These words, in a statute pro-
viding for the withdrawal of the names of peti-
tioners for a road improvement district when val-
id reasons therefor are presented, mean a sound
sufficient reason, such as fraud, deceit, misrepre-
sentation, duress, etc., a reason upon which the
petitioner could support or justify his change in
attitude. The word "valid" necessarily possesses
an element of legal strength and force, and incon-
sistent positions have no such force. Echols v.
Trice, 130 Ark. 97, 196 S.W. 801, 802.

## VALIDATE

To test the validity of; to make
valid; to confirm. Thompson v. Town of Frost-
proof, 89 Fla. 92, 103 So. 118. To sanction, to af-

tion to mere regularity. Home Ins. Co. of New
York v. Gaines, 74 Colo. 62, 218 P. 907, 908.

## VALIDITY OF A STATUTE

This phrase, with-
in the meaning of a constitutional provision relat-
ing to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, re-
fers to the power to enact the particular statute,
and not merely to its judicial construction or ap-
plication. Boehringer v. Yuma County, 15 Ariz.
546, 140 P. 507, 508.

## VALIDITY OF A TREATY

The term "validity,"
as applied to treaties, admits of two descriptions—
necessary and voluntary. By the former is meant
made by persons authorized by, and for purposes
consistent with, the constitution. By voluntary
validity is meant that validity which a treaty,
voidable by reason of violation by the other party,
still continues to retain by the silent acquiescence
and will of the nation. It is voluntary, because it
is at the will of the nation to let it remain or
to extinguish it. The principles which govern and
decide the necessary validity of a treaty are of
a judicial nature, while those on which its vol-
untary validity depends are of a political nature.
2 Paine 688, as paraphrased in 5 Moore, Int.L.
Dig. 183.

## VALIDITY OF A WILL

As used in will contest
statute has reference only to the genuineness or
legal sufficiency of will under attack. In re El-
liott's Estate, 22 Wash.2d 334, 156 P.2d 427, 438, 157
A.L.R. 1335.

As applied to a mountainous country,
lowlands, in contradistinction to mountain slopes
and ridges. Whaley v. Northern Pac. R. Co., C.C.
Mont., 167 F. 664.

## VALOR BENEFICIORUM

L. Lat. The value
of every ecclesiastical benefice and preferment,
according to which the first fruits and tenths are
collected and paid. It is commonly called the
"king's books," by which the clergy are at pres-
ent rated. 2 Steph.Comm. 533; Wharton.

## VALOR MARITAGII

Lat. Value of the marri-
age. The amount forfeited under the ancient ten-
ures by a ward to a guardian who had offered her
a marriage without disparagement, which she re-
fused. In feudal law, the guardian in chivalry
had the right of tendering to his infant ward a
suitable match, without "disparagement," (in-
equality,) which, if the infants refused, they for-
feited the value of the marriage (valor maritagii)
to their guardian; that is, so much as a jury
would assess, or any one would bona fide give, to
the guardian for such an alliance. 2 Bl.Comm.
70; Litt. § 110.
A writ which lay against the ward, on coming
of full age, for that he was not married, by his
guardian, for the value of the marriage, and this
though no convenient marriage had been offered.
Termes de la Ley.

## VALUABLE

Of financial or market value; com-
manding or worth a good price; of considerable
worth in any respect; estimable. Webster, Dict.

## VALUABLE CONSIDERATION

A class of con-
sideration upon which a promise may be founded,
which entitles the promisee to enforce his claim
against an unwilling promisor. Cockrell v. Mc-
Kenna, 103 N.J.L. 166, 134 A. 687, 688, 48 A.L.R.
234, some right, interest, profit, or benefit accru-
ing to one party, or some forbearance, detriment,
loss, or responsibility given, suffered, or under-
taken by the other. Onsrud v. Paulsen, 219 Wis.
1, 261 N.W. 541, 542. Industrial Loan & Invest-
ment Bank v. Dardine, 207 N.C. 509, 177 S.E. 635.
A gain or loss to either party is not essential, it
otherwise exert. Miller Ice Co. v. Crim, 299 Ill.
App. 615, 20 N.E.2d 347. It need not be translat-
able into dollars and cents, but is sufficient if it
consists of performance, or promise thereof, which
promisor treats and considers of value to him.
Asmus v. Longenecker, 131 Neb. 608, 269 N.W.
117, 119. It is not essential that the person to
whom the consideration moves should be bene-
fited, provided the person from whom it moves is,
in a legal sense, injured. The injury may consist
of a compromise of a disputed claim or forbear-
ance to exercise a legal right, the alteration in
position being regarded as a detriment that forms
a consideration independent of the actual value
of the right forborne. Boston Excelsior Co. v.
Amerio, 147 Misc. 1, 263 N.Y.S. 174. Mutual prom-
ises in contract is sufficient. Adams, Payne &
Gleaves v. Indiana Wood Preserving Co., 155 Va.
18, 154 S.E. 558, 562. For "Fair and Valuable Con-
sideration," see that title.
The following was said to be a valuable consideration:
Extension of time for payment of an obligation. C. I. T.
Corporation v. Furrow, 227 Iowa 961, 289 N.W. 697, 698:
Farmers & Merchants State Bank of Cawker City v. Hig-
gins, 149 Kan. 783, 89 P.2d 916. Marriage. Rutland v. Nor-
ris, 154 Fla. 894, 19 So.2d 418, 419. Release of property
subject to execution. Bradley v. DeLoach, 176 Ga. 142,
167 S.E. 301, 303. Pre-existing debt. Yale Oil Corporation
v. Sedlacek, 99 Mont. 411, 43 P.2d 887, 890. (Contra Dun-
can v. Jones, Tex.Civ.App., 153 S.W.2d 214, 216.) The dis
tinction between a good and a valuable consideration is
that the former consists of blood, or of natural love and
affection; as when a man grants an estate to a near rela-
tion from motives of generosity, prudence, and natural
duty; and the latter consists of such a consideration as
money, marriage which is to follow, or the like, which the
law esteems an equivalent given for the grant. 2 Bl.Comm.
297; Exum v. Lynch, 188 N.C. 392, 125 S.E. 15, 18; Gay v.
Fricks, 211 Ala. 119, 99 So. 846, 847; Barton v. Wilson,
116 Ark. 400, 172 S.W. 1032, 1034.

## VALUABLE IMPROVEMENTS

As used in a
statute relating to the specific performance of a
parol contract for the purchase of real estate, im-
provements of such character as add permanent
value to the freehold, and such as would not like-
ly be made by one not claiming the right to the
possession and enjoyment of the freehold estate.
Improvements of a temporary and unsubstantial
character will not amount to such part perform-
ance as, when accompanied by possession alone,
will take the contract out of the operation of the
statute of frauds. Farr v. West, 152 Ga. 595, 110
S.E. 724. The valuable improvements may, how-
ever, be slight and of small value, provided they
are substantial and permanent in their nature,
beneficial to the freehold, and such as none but an
owner would ordinarily make. Vickers v. Robin-
son, 157 Ga. 731, 122 S.E. 405, 408.

## VALUABLE PAPERS

This term as used in stat-
ute requiring that a holographic will devising
realty be found among the "valuable papers" of
decedent, in order to be effective, refers to such
papers as are regarded by the testator as worthy
of preservation and therefore in his estimation of

## VALUE

The utility of an object in satisfying,
directly or indirectly, the needs or desires of hu-
man beings, called by economists "value in use;"
or its worth consisting in the power of purchasing
other objects, called "value in exchange." Joint
Highway Dist. No. 9 v. Ocean Shore R. Co., 128
Cal.App. 743, 18 P.2d 413, 417. Also the estimated
or appraised worth of any object or property, cal-

Bank of Keller, Tex.Civ.App., 233 S.W. 326, 328; Farr-
Barnes Lumber Co. v. Town of St. George, 128 S.C. 67, 122
S.E. 24, 26.
In economic consideration, the word "value," when used
in reference to property, has a variety of significations,
according to the connection in which the word is em-
ployed. It may mean the cost of a production or reproduc-
tion of the property in question, when it is sometimes
called "sound value" ; or it may mean the purchasing
power of the property, or the amount of money which the
property will command in exchange, if sold, this being
called its "market value," which in the case of any par-
ticular property may be more or less than either the cost
of its production or its value measured by its utility to the
present or some other owner; or the word may mean the
subjective value of property, having in view its profitable-
ness for some particular purpose, sometimes termed its
"value for use." William H. Low Estate Co. v. Lederer
Realty Corporation, 35 R.I. 352, 86 A. 881, 883, Ann.Cas.

"Value," as used in Const.U.S. art. 1, § 8, giving Con-
gress power to coin money and regulate the value thereof,
is the true, inherent, and essential value, not depending
upon accident, place, or person, but the same everywhere
and to every one, and in this sense regulating the value of
the coinage is merely determining and maintaining coinage
composed of certain coins within certain limitations at a
certain specific composition and weight. Klattenburg v.
Qualsett, 114 Neb. 18, 205 N.W. 577, 578.

As respects whether value of stolen property equals or
exceeds jurisdictional amount fixed by the National Stolen
Property Act, "value" of stolen property is market value
at time and place of taking, if it has a market value. Na-
tional Stolen Property Act, §§ 1-7, 18 U.S.C.A. § 413 et seq.
Husten v. United States, C.C.A.Minn., 95 F.2d 168.

of trial, not at time of seizure thereof. Spear v. Auto
Dealers' Discount Corporation, 154 Misc. 801, 278 N.Y.S.

market value, (which title see infra). Epstein v. Boston
Housing Authority, 317 Mass. 297, 58 N.E.2d 135, 137.

tion sufficient to support a simple contract. Blumberg v.
Taggart, 213 Minn. 39, 5 N.W.2d 388, 392.

nel & Terminal R. Co. v. Miller, Sup., 26 N.Y.S.2d

67 P.2d 765, 766.
Net Value
The "reserve" or "net value" of a life insur-
ance policy is the fund accumulated out of the net
premiums during the earlier years of the policy
while the premium uniform throughout life or a
term of years exceeds the actual value of the risk,
and with the net premiums to be received in the
future is the exact mathematical equivalent of the
obligation incurred by the company. Hay v. Meri-
dian Life & Trust Co., 57 Ind.App. 536, 101 N.E.
651, 654. The "net value" of a policy is equivalent
to "reserve," and means that part of the annual
premium paid by insured which, according to the
American Experience Table of Mortality, must be
set apart to meet or mature the company's ob-
ligations to insured, the net value of a policy on
a given date being its actual value, its reserve.
Jefferson v. New York Life Ins. Co., 151 Ky. 609,
152 S.W. 780, 783.

ly produce, either at once or in the future. El-
liott v. Empire Natural Gas Co., C.C.A.Kan., 4 F.
2d 493, 497.
Value of Plant in Successful Operation
Synonymous with "going value," or "going con-
purchaser will give for the properties and busi-
ness of the companies because they are going con
cerns with established businesses; the additional
value, over and above the fair and reasonable
value of the physical properties plus the work-
ing capital, which a customer would pay for
the property because it is a going concern. Pa-
cific Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Whitcomb, D.
C.Wash., 12 F.2d 279, 284.
Value Received

eration has been given for it. Baker v. Thomas,
102 Neb. 401, 167 N.W. 407; Clayton v. Clayton, 125
N.J.L. 537, 17 A.2d 496, 497. It is prima facie evi-
dence of consideration; Palmer v. Blanchard, 113

es v. Bank, 13 S.Ct. 900, 149 U.S. 298, 37 L.Ed.
743; although not necessarily in money, Osgood
v. Bringolf, 32 Iowa, 265.
The phrase when put in a bill of exchange, will bear
two interpretations : The drawer of the bill may be pre-
sumed to acknowledge the fact that he has received value
from the payee, 3 Maule & S. 351; Benjamin v. Tillman,
2 McLean 213, Fed.Cas.No.1,304; or when the bill has been
made payable to the order of the drawer and accepted, it
implies that value has been received by the acceptor. 5
Maule & S. 65; Thurman v. Van Brunt, 19 Barb.. N.Y.,
409. The words are not required by the Uniform Negoti-
able Instruments Act.

## VALUED POLICY

One in which a definite val-
uation is by agreement of both parties put on the
subject-matter of the insurance and written in the
face of the policy and such value, in the absence
of fraud or mistake, is conclusive on the parties.
Lee v. Hamilton Fire Ins. Co., 130 Misc.Rep. 165,
223 N.Y.S. 441, 442. One in which both property
insured and loss are valued. Hight v. Maryland
Ins. Co., 69 S.D. 320, 10 N.W.2d 285, 288.

fect a steady [firm or resolute] man. 7 Coke,

## VARDA

In old Scotch law. Ward; custody;
guardianship. Answering to "warda," in old Eng-
lish law. Spelman.

## VARENNA

In old Scotch law. A warren. An-
swering to "warenna," in old English law. Spel-
man.

## VARIANCE

In pleading and practice. A dis-
crepancy or disagreement between two instru-
ments or two steps in the same cause, which ought
by law to be entirely consonant. Thus, if the
evidence adduced by the plaintiff does not agree
with the allegations of his declaration, it is a var-
iance; and so if the statement of the cause of
action in the declaration does not coincide with
that given in the writ. See Keiser v. Topping, 72
Ill. 229; Mulligan v. U. S., 56 C.C.A. 50, 120 F. 98;
State v. Wadsworth, 30 Conn. 57; Mathews v. U.
S., C.C.A.Neb., 15 F.2d 139, 142. For "Fatal Vari-
ance," see that title.
A disagreement between the allegations and the proof
in some matter which, in point of law, is essential to the
charge or claim. Franks v. Reeder, 101 Okl. 18, 223 P. 126
127; State v. Brozich, 108 Ohio St. 559, 141 N.E. 491. A
substantial departure in the evidence adduced from the
issue as made by the pleadings. Sposedo v. Merriman, 111
Me. 530, 90 A. 387, 392; Davidson Grocery Co. v. Johnston,
24 Idaho, 336, 133 P. 929, 931, Ann.Cas.1915C, 1129. The
test of materiality of "variance" in an information is
whether the pleading so fully and correctly informs a de-
fendant of offense with which he is charged that, taking
into account proof which is introduced against him, he is
not misled in making his defense. People v. Guerrero,
22 Ca1.2d 183, 137 P.2d 21, 24.
To constitute a "variance," there must be a real and
tangible difference between the allegations in the pleading
and the proof offered in its support. James A. C. Tait &
Co. v. Stryker, 117 Or. 338, 243 P. 104, 106. The difference
must be substantial and material. Epstein v. Waas, 28
N.M. 608, 216 P. 506, 508; Johnson v. Doubleday, 92 Vt.
267, 102 A. 1038, 1040. It must be one that actually mis-
leads the adverse party to his prejudice in maintaining his
action or defense on the merits, German-American Bank of
Seattle v. Wright, 85 Wash. 460, 148 P. 769, 771, Ann.Cas.
1917D, 381; or, in criminal cases, one which might mis-
lead the defense or expose a defendant to being put twice
in jeopardy for the same offense, Brashears v. State, 38
Okl.Cr. 175, 259 P. 665, 667; McCallister v. State, 217 Ind.
65, 26 N.E.2d 391, 393.
A "variance" in criminal case is an essential difference
between accusation and proof, best illustrated where one
crime is alleged and another proved, and test of material
is the same as that alleged in the first, and accordingly a
plea of autrefois acquit must be upon a prosecution for the
identical offense. U. S. v. Wills, C.C.A.Pa., 36 F.2d 855,
"Variance," i. e., a disagreement between allegations
and proof in some matter which, in point of law, is essen-
tial to the claim or charge, differs from "repugnancy,"
which consists of two inconsistent allegations in one plead-
ing. Fowler v. State, 20 Okl.Cr. 410, 203 P. 900, 901.
"Variance" also differs from failure of proof. Gordon.
v. Pollock, 124 Okl. 64, 253 P. 1021, 1023. A variance oc-
curs when, though the pleading and proof do not exactly
correspond, they may be made to do so by amendment in
the discretion of the court and upon such terms and con-
ditions as may be just. Deligny v. Tate Furniture Co.,
170 N.C. 189, 86 S.E. 980, 984.

## VARIATION

Difference in degrees between the
direction of the true pole and the magnetic pole;
it is comparatively fixed for any one locality, but
is not the same in different localities. The Aakre,
C.C.A.N.Y., 122 F.2d 469, 472.
VARIOUS, Separate. Simmons v. Ramsbottom,
51 Wyo. 419, 68 P.2d 153, 156.

## VARRANTIZATIO

In old Scotch law. Warran-
ty.

## VAS

## VASECTOMY

less operation, performed by section (cutting) of
the vas deferens or spermatic cord, or by a tying
.
off or ligaturing thereof;—sometimes performed
on rapists and other criminals (especially sexual
offenders), and on persons who are mentally de-
fective. Laws Iowa 1911, c. 129; Rem. & Bal.
Code (Wash.) § 2287 (Rem.Rev.Stat. § 2287) ; Rev.
Laws Nev. § 6293 (Comp.Laws 1929, § 9977). Some
of these and similar statutes have been declared
unconstitutional; Williams v. Smith, 190 Ind.
526, 131 N.E. 2; Mickle v. Henrichs, D.C.Nev., 262
F. 687; Smith v. Bd. of Examiners, 85 N.J.L. 46,
88 A. 963; but in 1927, the validity of a Virginia.
statute (Laws 1924, c. 394) providing for vasec-
tomy in the case of males and for salpingectomy
in the case of females was sustained in Buck v.
Bell, 47 .S.Ct. 584, 274 U.S. 200, 71 L.Ed. 1000, af-
firming 143 Va. 310, 130 S.E. 516, 51 A.L.R. 855.
Sterilization of the female may also be accom-
plished by an operation known as oOphorectomy
or ovariotomy. Acts Conn.1909, c. 209.

## VASSAL

In feudal law. A feudal tenant or
grantee; a feudatory; the holder of a fief on a
feudal tenure, and by the obligation of perform-
ing feudal services. The correlative term was
"lord." The vassal himself might be lord of some

species of slave who owed servitude and was in
a state of dependency on a superior lord. 2 Bla.
Comm. 53.

143 Va. 187, 129 S.E. 379, 382; even though, at the time of
the enactment of the legislation involved, automobiles were
not in use, U. S. v. One Cadillac Automobile, D.C.Tenn.,
2 F.2d 886, 888; City of Henderson v. Lockett, 157 Ky.
366, 163 S.W. 199, 201; White v. District of Columbia, 4
F.2d 163, 164, 55 App.D.C. 197. The term was held not to
include a street car in the following cases: City of Chicago

161 Minn. 322, 201 N.W. 606, 608, 46 A.L.R. 993.
As used in various statutes, however, the word is often
given a somewhat narrower meaning than that which
might be indicated by the above definition. Thus, it has
been held that the term is inapplicable to a hand sled,
Ide11 v. Day, 273 Pa. 34, 116 A. 506, 507, 20 A.L.R. 1429; to
a child's coaster, Wright v. Salzberger & Sons, 81 Cal.App.
690, 254 P. 671, 676; and to an elevator, Wilson v. C. Dor-
flinger & Sons, 218 N.Y. 84, 112 N.E. 567, 568, Ann.Cas.
1917D, 38, reversing Wilson v. C. Dorflinger & Sons, 170
App.Div. 119, 155 N.Y.S. 857, 858.
But as defined in the Tariff Act, it has a much broader
meaning, and includes any sort of conveyance used in the
transportation of passengers and merchandise either by
land or by water or through the air. Mellon v. Minneap-
olis, St. P. & S. S. M. Ry. Co., 56 App.D.C. 160, 11 F.2d
332, 334. United States v. One Pitcairn Biplane, Registra-

chiefly or exclusively used for the making of veils.
A veil is a piece of cloth or other material, usual-
ly thin and light, designed to be worn over the
head and face as an ornament or to protect or
wholly or partly conceal the face from view. The
textile material which is used to mask or screen
the features resting beneath the face panels of
caskets would be commonly and popularly regard-
ed as veiling. Tiedeman & Sons v. U. S., 8 Ct.
Cust.App. 134, 135.

## VEIN

In mining law. A continuous body of
mineral or mineralized rock, filling a seam or fis-
sure in the earth's crust, within defined bounda-
ries in the general mass of the mountain (which
boundaries clearly separate it from the neighbor-
ing rock), and having a general character of con-
tinuity in the direction of its length. San Fran-
cisco Chemical Co. v. Duffield, C.C.A.Wyo., 201
F. 830, 835; McMullin v. Magnuson, 102 Colo. 230,
78 P.2d 964, 968. It includes all deposits of miner-
al matter found through a mineralized zone or
belt coming from the same source, impressed with
the same forms, and appearing to have been creat-
ed by the same processes. Inyo Marble Co. v.
Loundagin, 7 P.2d 1067, 1072, 120 Cal.App. 298.
A requirement that a miner shall locate his claim "along
the vein" means along the out-crop or course of the apex,
and not along the strike. Stewart Mining Co. v. Bourne,
C.C.A.Idaho, 218 F. 327, 329.
The terms "principal," "original," and "primary," as
well as "secondary," "accidental," and "incidental," have
all been employed to describe the different veins found
within the same surface boundaries, but their meaning is
not entirely clear in all cases. They may refer to the rela-
tive importance or value of the different veins, or the rela-
tions to each other, or to the time of discovery, but the
words "secondary," "accidental," and "incidental" are
most frequently used to distinguish between the discovery
vein and other veins within the same surface boundaries.
Northport Smelting & Refining Co. v. Lone Pine-Suprise
Consol. Mines Co., D.C.Wash., 271 F. 105, 111.
Discovery Vein
That vein which served as a basis of the loca-
tion, in contradistinction to secondary, accidental,
and incidental veins. Northport Smelting & Re-
fining Co. v. Long Pine-Surprise Consol. Mines
Co., D.C.Wash., 271 F. 105, 113. The primary vein
for the purpose of locating a mining claim and de-
termining which are the end and which the side
lines. Where the discovery vein crosses the op-
posite side lines of the claim as located, the side
lines become end lines, not only with respect to
such vein, but for determination of extralateral
rights in any other vein which apexes within the
claim. Northport Smelting & Refining Co. v.
Lone Pine-Surprise Consol. Mines Co., C.C.A.
Wash., 278 F. 719, 720.

terfeit. Cowell.
VEL NON: Or not.
These words appear in the phrase "devisavit vel non"
(q. v.), meaning, literally, "did he devise or not." 26 C.
J.S. p. 1296. Examples of their use by the courts may be
seen in the following quotations : "So the sufficiency vel
non of the order of publication is important" (Cone v.
Benjamin, 27 So.2d 90, 97, 157 Fla. 800) ; "the negligence
vel non of the owner was * * * for the jury" (John-
son v. Wood, 21 So.2d 353, 355, 155 Fla. 753); and "We
come at last to the merits vel non of this appeal" (Hol-
lywood, Inc., v. Clark, 15 So.2d 175, 185, 153 Fla. 501).

tion of the purchaser. Special Tax School Dist.
No. 1 of Orange County v. Hillman, 131 Fla. 725,
179 So. 805, 809. An equitable security which aris-
es from the fact that a vendee has received from

tain possession. See Morgan v. Dalrymple, 59 N.
J.Eq. 22, 46 A. 664; Lee v. Murphy, 119 Cal. 364,
51 P. 549.
In English and American law a vendor's lien is excep-
tional in character, and is an importation from the civil
law, which found its recognition through courts of chan-
cery, on the equitable principle that the person who had
secured the estate of another ought not in conscience to be
allowed to keep it and not pay full consideration money,
and that to enforce that payment it was just that the ven-
dor should have a lien upon the property. Martin v. Beck-
er, 169 Cal. 301, 146 P. 665, 671, Ann.Cas.1916D, 171.

a cause is to be tried, commanding him that he
"cause to come" before the court, on a certain
day therein mentioned, twelve good and lawful
men of the body of his county, qualified according
to law, by whom the truth of the matter may be
the better known, and who are in no wise of kin
either to the plaintiff or to the defendant, to make
a jury of the county between the parties in the
action, because as well the plaintiff as the defend-

## VENIRE FACIAS DE NOVO

A fresh or new
venire, which the court grants when there has
been some impropriety or irregularity in return-
ing the jury, or where the verdict is so imperfect
or ambiguous that no judgment can be given upon
it, or where a judgment is reversed on error, and
a new trial awarded. See Bosseker v. Cramer, 18
Ind. 44; Maxwell v. Wright, 160 Ind. 515, 67 N.E.
267. "The ancient common-law mode of proceed-
ing to a new trial was by a writ of venire facias
de novo. The new trial is a modern invention, in-
tended to mitigate the severity of the proceeding
to attaint. While a venire de novo and new trial
are quite different, they are alike in that a new
trial takes place in both. The material difference
between them is that a venire de novo must be
granted upon matters appearing upon the face
of the record, but a new trial may be granted for
things out of the record. Lowry v. Indianapolis
Traction & Terminal Co., 77 Ind.App. 138, 126 N.E.
223, 225. See, also, 1 Wils. 48; 47 Am.L.Rev. 377.

die v. State, 202 Ind. 40 171 N.E. 585.

A judicial writ
directed to the sheriff, when issue was joined in
an action, commanding him to cause to come to
Westminster, on such a day, twelve free and law-
ful men of his county by whom the truth of the
matter at issue might be better known. This writ
was abolished by section 104 of the common-law
procedure act, 1852, and by section 105 a precept
issued by the judges of assize is substituted in its
place. The process so substituted is sometimes
loosely spoken of as a "venire." Brown. See,
also, Steph.Pl. 104; Cridland v. Floyd, 6 Serg. &
R. (Pa.) 414; 3 Chitty, Pr. 797.

while it is a foetus.

S.E. 812, 813. Stanton Trust and Savings Bank v. John-
son, 104 Mont. 235, 65 P.2d 1188, 1189.
In the common-law practice, that part of the
declaration in an action which designates the
county in which the action is to be tried. Sweet.
Local Venue

remaining in the lord, is given by him or by the
law to another. Ham. N.P. 393, 394.

## VERBA ILLATA (RELATA) INESSE VIDEN- TUR

Words referred to are to be considered as

TIUM EX EIS POTIUS QUAM EX VERBIS AP-

that the intention of the contracting parties may
appear rather from them than from the words.
Calvin.
VERBA OFFENDI POSSUNT, IMO AB EIS RE-
CEDERE LICET, UT VERBA AD SANUM INTEL-
LECTUM REDUCANTUR. Words may be op-
posed, [taken in a contrary sense,] nay, we may
disregard them altogether, in order that the [gen-
eral] words [of an instrument] may be restored
to a sound meaning. A maxim of the civilians.
Calvin.
VERBA ORDINATION'S QUANDO VERIFICA-
RI POSSUNT IN SUA VERA SIGNIFICATIONE,
TRAHI AD EXTRANEUM INTELLECTUAL NON
DEBENT. When the words of an ordinance can

EM ADDITA, AD PRIORA QUirE CERTITUDINE

vin; Spiegelius.

## VERBA SUNT INDICES ANIMI

Latch, 106.

## VERBAL

Strictly, of or pertaining to words;
expressed in words, whether spoken or written,
but commonly in spoken words; hence, by confu-
sion, spoken; oral. Webster, Dict. Parol; by
word of mouth; as, verbal agreement, verbal evi-
dence; or written, but not signed, or not execut-
ed with the formalities required for a deed or
prescribed by statute in particular cases. Mus-
grove v. Jackson, 59 Miss. 390.

## VERBAL ACT DOCTRINE

Under this doctrine,
utterances accompanying some act or conduct to
which it is desired to give legal effect are admissi-
ble where conduct to be characterized by words is
material to issue and equivocal in its nature, and
words accompany conduct and aid in giving it le-
gal significance. Keefe v. State, 50 Ariz. 295, 72
P.2d 425, 427.
Under doctrine, where declarations of an individual are
so connected with his acts as to derive a degree of credit
from such connection, independently of the declaration, the
declaration becomes part of the transaction and is admis-
sible. American Employers Ins. Co. v. Wentworth, 90
N.H. 112, 5 A.2d 265, 269.
The "verbal act doctrine" and the "res gestaa doctrine"
coincide practically and serve equally to admit certain
sorts of statements, but they are nevertheless wholly dis-
tinct in their nature and in their right to exist. American
Employers Ins. Co. v. Wentworth, 90 N.H. 112, 5 A.2d 265,
VERBAL NOTE. A memorandum or note, in di-
plomacy, not signed, sent when an affair has con-
tinued a long time without any reply, in order
to avoid the appearance of an urgency which
perhaps is not required; and, on the other hand,
to guard against the supposition that it is forgot-
ten, or that there is an intention of not prosecuting
it any further. Wharton.

## VERBAL PROCESS

In Louisiana. ProcOs ver-
bal, (q. v.).
VERBIS STANDUM UBI NULLA AMBIGUITAS.
One must abide by the words where there is no
ambiguity. Tray. Lat. Max. 612.

## VERBUM IMPERFECT! TEMPORIS REM AD- HUC IMPERFECTAM SIGNIFICAT

The im-
perfect tense of the verb indicates an incomplete
matter. Mactier v. Frith, 6 Wend. (N.Y.) 103, 120,
21 Am.Dec. 262.
VERDERER, or VERDEROR. An officer of the
king's forest, who is sworn to maintain and keep
the assizes of the forest, and to view, receive, and
enroll the attachments and presentments of all
manner of trespasses of vert and venison in the
forest. Manw. c. 6, § 5.

## VERDICT

From the Latin "veredictum," a true
declaration. State v. Blue, 134 La. 561, 64 So. 411,
413; Clark v. State, 170 Tenn. 499, 97 S.W.2d 644,
646. In practice. The formal and unanimous de-
cision or finding made by a jury, impaneled and
sworn for the trial of a cause, and reported to
the court (and accepted by it), upon the matters
or questions duly submitted to them upon the trial.
Sitterson v. Sitterson, 191 N.C. 319, 131 S.E. 641,
642, 51 A.L.R. 760; Roth v. East Connellsville
Coke Co., 242 Pa. 23, 88 A. 781. A declaration of
the truth as to matters of fact submitted to jury.
Groves v. State, 162 Ga. 161, 132 S.E. 769, 770;
Arcadia Timber Co. v. Evans, 304 Mo. 674, 264
S.W. 810. The definitive answer given by the jury
to the court concerning the matters of fact com-
mitted to the jury for their deliberation and de-
termination. Ralston v. Stump, 75 Ohio App. 375,
62 N.E.2d 293, 294.
A true response of 12 men to the issues in the case, ar-
rived at after a consideration of all the evidence in the
case, by each juror acting independently and voluntarily
in forming his conclusion, or the concurrent coincident
conclusion of the 12. Roberts v. State, 26 Ala.App. 331,
159 So. 373, 374.
Explanations or comments in a written verdict are no
part of the "verdict" of the jury but are mere "surplus-
age". Anderson v. Penn Hall Co., D.C.Pa., 47 F.Supp. 691,
Until accepted by the court, a finding of the jury is not
a 'verdict." Schulman v. Stock, 89 Conn. 237, 93 A. 531.
Anderson v. Penn Hall Co., D.C.Pa., 47 F.Supp. 691, 692.
The only "verdict" is that which the jury announces
orally to the court, and which is received and recorded at
direction of court as the jury's finding.
Although in common language, the word may be used in
a more extended sense, it has a well-defined signification
in law. It means the decision of a jury, and not the deci-
sion of a court or a referee or a commissioner. Kerner v.
Petigo, 25 Kan. 656. "Decision" bears the same relation
to non jury cases as "verdict" to jury cases, and a "ver-
dict" is a conclusion upon the facts, and in effect a direc-
tion for judgment, while a "decision" is an order for judg-
ment, and determines the judgment to be entered. Scho-
field v. Baker, D.C.Wash., 242 F. 657, 658.
Adverse Verdict
Where a party, appealing from an allowance of
damages by commissioners, recovers a verdict in
his favor, but for a less amount of damages than
had been originally allowed, such verdict is ad-
verse to him, within the meaning of his under-
taking to pay costs if the verdict should be ad-
verse to him. Hamblin v. Barnstable County, 16
Gray (Miss.) 256.
Chance Verdict
One determined by hazard or lot, and not by
the deliberate understanding and agreement of
the jury. Goodman v. Cody, 1 Wash.T. 335, 34
Am.Rep. 808; Improvement Co. v. Adams, 1 Colo.
App. 250, 28 P. 662.
A verdict is not a "chance verdict" merely because, in
arriving at the amount, the jury took each juror's estimate
of what should be assessed as the damages and divided the
total by the number of jurors, and afterward knowingly
and understandingly agreed that such quotient should be
the amount of the verdict. Great Northern Ry. Co. v.
Lenton, 31 N. D. 555, 154 N.W. 275, 277. See, also, Foley v.
Hornung, 35 Cal.App. 304, 169 P. 705, 709. See Quotient
Verdict, infra.
Compromise Verdict
One which is the result, not of justifiable con-
cession of views, but of improper compromise of
the vital principles which should have controlled
the decision. Goelet v. Matt J. Ward Co., 155 C.
C.A. 9, 242 F. 65, 67. Although it is proper for
jurors to harmonize their views and reach a ver-
dict with proper regard for each other's opinions,
it is not proper for any juror to surrender his con-
scientious convictions on any material issue in
return for a relinquishment by others of their like
settled opinions on another issue, producing a re-
sult which does not command the approval of the
whole panel. Snyder v. Portland Ry., Light &
Power Co., 107 Or. 673, 215 P. 887, 889.
Excessive Verdict
See Excessive Verdict.
False Verdict
One obviously opposed to the principles of right
and justice; an untrue verdict. Formerly, if a
jury gave a false verdict, the party injured by it
might sue out and prosecute a writ of attaint
against them, either at common law or on the
purpose of reversing the judgment and punishing
the jury for their verdict; but not where the jury
erred merely in point of law, if they found ac-
cording to the judge's direction. The practice of
setting aside verdicts and granting new trials, how-
ever, so superseded the use of attaints that there
is no instance of one to be found in the books or
reports later than in the time of Elizabeth, and it
was altogether abolished by 6 Geo. IV. c. 50, § 60.
Wharton.
General Verdict
A verdict whereby the jury find either for the
plaintiff or for the defendant in general terms;
the ordinary form of a verdict. Glenn v. Sum-
ner, 10 S.Ct. 41, 132 U.S. 152, 33 L.Ed. 301; Childs
v. Carpenter, 87 Me. 114, 32 A. 780. A finding by
the jury in the terms of the issue referred to
them. Settle v. Alison, 52 Am.Dec. 393, 8 Ga. 208.
Tidd, Pr. 798. That by which the jury pronounces
generally on all of the issues in favor of plaintiff
or defendant. Skelton v. City of Newberg, 76 Or.
126, 148 P. 53, 55; Cleveland, C. C. & St. L. Ry.
Co. v. Wolf, 189 Ind. 585, 128 N.E. 38, 40. That
by which they pronounce generally upon all or
any of the issues, either in favor of the plaintiff
or defendant;--distinguished from a special ver-
dict, which is that by which the jury finds facts
only. Comp.Stat. Ok1.1921, § 551 (Code 1931, §
369).
A "general verdict" is one by which the jury pronounces
at the same time on the facts and the law, either in favor
of the plaintiff or the defendant. Schofield v. Baker, D.C.
Wash., 242 F. 657, 658; Co.Litt. 228; 4 Bla.Comm. 461. A
general verdict of guilty in a criminal case means guilty
on every count. Simmons v. State, 162 Ga. 316, 134 S.E.
54, 55.
Open Verdict
A verdict of a coroner's jury which finds that
the subject "came to his death by means to the
jury unknown," or "came to his death at the hands
of a person or persons to the jury unknown," that
is, one which leaves open either the question
whether any crime was committed or the identity
of the criminal.
Partial Verdict
In criminal law, a verdict by which the jury ac-
quit the defendant as to a part of the accusation
and find him guilty as to the residue. State v.
McGee, 33 S.E. 353, 55 S.C. 247, 74 Am.St.Rep. 741;
U. S. v. Watkins, 28 F.Cas. 419.
Privy Verdict
One given after the judge has left or adjourned
the court, and the jury, being agreed, in order to
be delivered from their confinement, obtain leave
to give their verdict privily to the judge out of
court. Such a verdict is of no force unless after-
wards affirmed by a public verdict given openly in
court. This practice is now superseded by that
of rendering a sealed verdict. See Young v. Sey-
mour, 4 Neb. 89.
Public Verdict
A verdict openly delivered by the jury in court.
Withee v. Rowe, 45 Me. 571.
A money verdict the amount of which is fixed
by the following process: Each juror writes down
the sum he wishes to award by the verdict, and
these amounts are all added together, and the to-
tal is divided by twelve, (the number of jurors,)
the quotient being the verdict of the jury by their
agreement. Speer v. State, 130 Ark. 457, 198 S.W.
113, 115'; St. Louis & S. F. R. Co. v. Brown, 45
Okl. 143, 144 P. 1075, 1077; Hamilton v. Owego
Water Works, 22 App.Div. 573, 48 N.Y.S. 106. To
invalidate a verdict of this kind, it must appear
that, in advance of the computation, there was an
agreement to be bound by the result. In re Hav-
enmaier's Estate, 163 Minn. 218, 203 N.W. 958, 959;
Great Northern Ry. Co. v. Lenton, 154 N.W. 275,
277, 31 N.D. 555; Carter v. Marshall Oil Co., 185
Iowa 416, 170 N.W. 798, 800.
Sealed Verdict
See Sealed.
Special Verdict
A special finding of the facts of a case by a jury,
leaving to the court the application of the law to
the facts thus found. 1 Archb.Pr.K.B. 213; 3
Bl.Comm. 377; Statler v. U. S., 15 S.Ct. 616, 157
U.S. 277, 39 L.Ed. 700; Samlin v. U. S., C.C.A., 278
F. 170, 172. A special finding by the jury on each
material issue, of the case. Ford v. Brown, 45
Nev. 202, 200 P. 522, 525.
A "special verdict" exhibits the legitimate facts and
leaves the legal conclusions to the court, and must cover
all the issues in the case, while an answer to a special
interrogatory may respond to but a single inquiry pertain-
ing merely to one issue essential to the general verdict.
Childress v. Lake Erie & W. R. Co., 182 Ind. 251, 105 N.E.
467, 470.
Verdict by Lot
This type of verdict was formerly held to be
legitimate, 1 Keble 811; but such verdicts are
now held to be illegal. See Barnard v. State, 221
S.W. 293, 294, 87 Tex.Cr.R. 365; Chance Verdict,
supra.
Verdict Contrary to Law
A verdict which law does not authorize jury to
render on evidence because conclusion drawn is
not justified thereby. Gruhn v. J. H. Taylor
Const. Co., 180 Misc. 956, 40 N.Y.S.2d 765, 770.
One which is contrary to the principles of law as
applied to the facts which the jury were called
upon to try and contrary to the principles of law
which should govern the cause. Piepho v. Gesse,
106 Ind.App. 450, 18 N.E.2d 468, 471.
Verdict of Guilty But Insane
A special verdict which amounts to an acquittal
of the person tried. Rex v. Taylor, [1915] 2 K.
B. 709, 712.
Verdict of No Cause of Action
A verdict for defendant. Feller v. Mulliner, 2
Johns. 181.
Verdict of Not Guilty
Simply a verdict of not proven in the particular
case tried; it is not a verdict of innocence, and
of any other person than the defendant who was
actually acquitted. Woody v. State, 10 Okl.Cr. 322,
136 P. 430, 432, 49 L.R.A.,N.S., 479.
Verdict Subject to Opinion of Court
A verdict returned by the jury, the entry of
judgment upon which is subject to the determina-
tion of points of law reserved by the court upon
the trial.

## VERDICT, ESTOPPEL BY

The term is some-
times applied to the estoppel arising from a for-
mer adjudication of the same fact or issue between
the same parties or their privies. Chicago Theo-
logical Seminary v. People, 189 Ill. 439, 59 N.E.
977; Swank v. Railway Co., 61 Minn. 423, 63 N.W.
1088. But this use is not correct, as it is not the
verdict which creates an estoppel, but the judg-
ment, and it is immaterial whether a jury par-
ticipated in the trial or not. The doctrine of es-
toppel by verdict is but another branch of the doc-
trine of res judicata. Chicago Title & Trust Co.
v. National Storage Co., 260 Ill. 485, 103 N.E. 227,
231; Citizen's Loan & Trust Co. of Washington,
Ind. v. Sanders, 99 Ind.App. 77, 187 N.E. 396, 398.
See, however, Coffman v. Hope Natural Gas Co.,
74 W.Va. 57, 81 S.E. 575. See, also, Judgment, Es-
toppel By.
A former adjudication is conclusive in subsequent pro-
ceeding between same parties but on a different cause of
action as to facts actually decided. Kimpton v. Spellman,
351 Mo. 674, 173 S.W.2d 886, 891; Holtz v. Beighley, 211
Minn. 153, 300 N.W. 445, 446.
It arises when material fact has been determined in
former suit between same parties or those in privity with
them, in which such fact was also material. Little v. Blue
Goose Motor Coach Co., 346 Ill. 266, 178 N.E. 496, 497;
Citizen's Loan & Trust Co. of Washington, Ind. v. Sanders,
187 N.E. 396, 99 Ind.App. 77. It is limited to matters ac-
tually or by necessary implication found and determined.
In prior action. Missouri District Telegraph Co. v. South-
western Bell Telephone Co., 338 Mo. 692, 93 S.W.2d 19, 22.
It operates only as to issues actually litigated. Gustafson
V. Gustafson, 178 Minn. 1, 226 N.W. 412, 413.
It is not a decision on the law that concludes the parties,
but the determination of a controlling fact or matter in
issue. People v. Louisville & N. R. Co., 350 Ill. 274, 183
N.E. 233, 235.
The rules of "estoppel by verdict" apply to some fact or
issue necessarily determined by the previous litigation.
Skolnik v. Petella, 376 Ill. 500, 34 N.E.2d 825, 827.
To operate as "?,stoppel by verdict," it is necessary that
there shall have been a finding of a specific fact in former
judgment or record that was material and controlling in
case, or was necessarily involved in verdict or judgment,
and also material and controlling in pending case. Brown
v. Brown, 286 Ill.App. 471, 3 N.E.2d 945, 946.
Where controlling fact or question material to determi-
nation of both causes is decided in a former suit and is
again in issue in a subsequent suit between same parties,
first adjudication will, if properly presented, be conclusive.
Brown v. Brown, 286 Ill.App. 471, 3 N.E.2d 945, 946; Mc-
Kee v. Producers' & Refiners' Corporation, 170 Okl. 559, 41
P.2d 466, 469.

the actual amount of his claim, but need not authenticate
the act by his seal. Ashley v. Wright, 19 Ohio St. 291.
Confirmation of the correctness, truth, or au-
thenticity of a pleading, account, or other paper,
by an affidavit, oath, or deposition. Herbert v.

The word "verified," when used in a statute, ordinarily
imports a verity attested by the sanctity of an oath.
Bristol v. Buck, 201 App.Div. 100, 194 N.Y.S. 53, 55. It is
frequently used interchangeably with "sworn." Frances-
coni v. Independent School Dist. of Wall Lake, 204 Iowa,

thenticate; to prove; to maintain; to affirm; to
support; second; back as a friend. MacNeill v.
Maddox, 194 Ga. 802, 22 S.E.2d 653, 654.

substantiate by oath, and sometimes by argument. When
used in legal proceedings it is generally employed in the
former sense. De Witt v. Hosmer, 3 How.Prac., N.Y., 284.

ler, 25 N.H. 523.

States have an interest. The Sally, 1 Gall. 58, F.

ble, interest. Brown. See Tayloe v. Gould, 10
Barb. (N.Y.) 388; estate by which present interest

lutely or defeasibly vested. L'Etourneau v. Henquenet,
89 Mich. 428, 50 N.W. 1077, 28 Am.St.Rep. 310. If a pres-
ent right exists to future possession, the estate is "vest-
ed," even though actual possession may be defeated by
a future event. Wheaton Coal. Co. v. Harris, 288 Pa. 294,

reversions, vested remainders, such executory de-

Wharton. See Smith v. West, 103 Ill. 337; Hawley
v. James, 5 Paige (N.Y.) 466; Gates v. Seibert, 157
Mo. 254, 57 S.W. 1065, 80 Am.St.Rep. 625.

## VESTED IN POSSESSION

to a right of present enjoyment actually existing.
See Vest.

## VESTED INTEREST

A present right or title to
a thing, which carries with it an existing right of
alienation, even though the right to possession or
enjoyment may be postponed to some uncertain
time in the future, as distinguished from a future
right, which may never materialize or ripen into
title, and it matters not how long or for what
length of time the future possession or right of
enjoyment may be postponed, if the present right
exists to alienate and pass title. Fugazzi v. Fu-
gazzi's Committee, 275 Ky. 62, 120 S.W.2d 779, 781.
A future interest not dependent on an uncertain
period or event, or a fixed present right of future

N.J.Misc. 393, 178 A. 574, 575. One in which there
is a present fixed right, either of present enjoy-
ment or of future enjoyment. Painter v. Hersch-
berger, 340 Mo. 347, 100 S.W.2d 532, 535.
It is not the uncertainty of enjoyment in the future, but
the uncertainty of the right of enjoyment, which makes
the difference between a "vested" and a "contingent" in-
terest. Mahoney v. Mahoney, 98 Conn. 525, 120 A. 342, 345;
Grant v. Grant, 187 Ga. 807, 2 S.E.2d 421, 427. A future
interest is vested when there is a person in being who
would have a right, defeasible or indefeasible, to the im-
mediate possession of the property, upon the ceasing of
the intermediate or precedent interest. Civil Code Cal. §
694. See Allison v. Allison, 101 Va. 537, 44 S.E. 904, 63

ing v. Speck, 41 Kan. 424, 21 P. 288, 3 L.R.A. 690.

## VESTED LEGACY

A legacy given in such terms
that there is a fixed, indefeasible right to its pay-
ment. In re Central Union Trust Co. of New York,
183 N.Y.S. 671, 673, 193 App.Div. 292. A legacy
payable at a future time, certain to arrive, and
not subject to conditions precedent, is vested,
where there is a person in esse at the testator's
death capable of taking when the time arrives,
though his interest may be altogether defeated by
his own death. In re Youngblood's Estate, 117 Pa.
Super. 550, 178 A. 517, 518. A legacy is said to be
vested when the words of the testator making the
bequest convey a transmissible interest, whether
present or future, to the legatee in the legacy.
Thus a legacy to one to be paid when he attains
the age of twenty-one years is a vested legacy, be-
cause it is given unconditionally and absolutely,
and therefore vests an immediate interest in the
legatee, of which the enjoyment only is deferred
or postponed. Brown. See Magoffin v. Patton, 4
242, 32 N.Y.S. 906; Rubencane v. McKee, 6 Del.Ch.
40, 6 A. 639.

ing to the then current rules of law, and of which
the individual could not be deprived arbitrarily
without injustice, or of which he could not justly
be deprived otherwise than by the established

Wash., 62 F. 429; Parker v. Schrimsher, Tex.Civ.
App., 172 S.W. 165, 168. Which cannot be inter-

arbitrarily without injustice. American States

ute which by reason of a succession of statutes on
the same subject-matter, amending or modifying
previous provisions of the same, are rendered use-
less or meaningless by such amendments. They

the lord forbids the bailiff to deliver them when
the sheriff comes to make replevin, the owner of

VETO (Lat. I forbid). The refusal of assent by
the executive officer whose assent is necessary to
perfect a law which has been passed by the legis-
lative body, and the message which is usually sent
to such body by the executive, stating such refusal
and the reasons therefor. It is either absolute or
qualified, according as the effect of its exercise
is either to destroy the bill finally, or to prevent
its becoming law unless again passed by a stated
proportion of votes or with other formalities. Or
the veto may be merely suspensive. See People
v. Board of Councilmen (Super. Buff.) 20 N.Y.
A statement by the Governor that he objects to certain
items of an appropriation bill, without stating his reasons
therefor, is insufficient to constitute an effective veto of
such items. State v. French, 133 Kan. 579, 300 P. 1082,
1083. And where Governor returned resolution to the
house in which it originated for purpose of correction of

VOID. Null; ineffectual; nugatory; having no
legal force or binding effect; unable, in law, to
support the purpose for which it was intended.
McGarry v. Village of Wilmette, 303 Ill. 147, 135
N.E. 96, 98; Hardison v. Gledhill, Ga.App., 33
S.E.2d 921, 924.
There is this difference between the two words "void"
and "voidable:" void in the strict sense, means that an
instrument or transaction is nugatory and ineffectual so
that nothing can cure it; voidable, when an imperfection
or defect can be cured by the act or confirmation of him
who could take advantage of it. Wharton. The term
"void," however, as applicable to conveyances or other
agreements, has not at all times been used with technical
precision, nor restricted to its peculiar and limited sense,
as contradistinguished from "voidable ;" it being frequent-
ly introduced, even by legal writers and jurists, when the
purpose is nothing further than to indicate that a contract
was invalid, and not binding in law. But the distinction
between the terms "void" and "voidable," in their appli-
cation to contracts, is often one of great practical impor-
tance; and, whenever entire technical accuracy is re-
quired, the term "void" can only be properly applied to
those contracts that are of no effect whatsoever, such as
are a mere nullity, and incapable of confirmation or rati-
fication. Allis v. Billings, 6 Mete., Mass., 415, 39 Am.Dec.
The word "void," in its strictest sense, means that which
has no force and effect, is without legal efficacy, is inca-
pable of being enforced by law, or has no legal or binding
force, but frequently the word is used and construed as
having the more liberal meaning of "voidable." In re
Validation of $50,000 Serial Funding Bonds of Clarke Coun-
ty, 187 Miss. 512, 193 So. 449, 452.
The word "void" is used in statutes in the sense of
utterly void so as to be incapable of ratification, and also
in the sense of voidable and resort must be had to the
rules of construction in many cases to determine in which
sense the Legislature intended to use it. An act or con-
tract neither wrong in itself nor against public policy,
which has been declared void by statute for the protection
or benefit of a certain party, or class of parties, is voidable
only. U. S. v. New York & Porto Rico S. S. Co., 239 U.S.
88, 36 S.Ct. 41, 42, 60 L. Ed. 161; Weede v. Iowa Southern
Utilities Co. of Delaware, 231 Iowa 784, 2 N.W.2d 372, 397,
VOID CONTRACT. One which never had any
legal existence or effect, and such contract can-
not in any manner have life breathed into it. Na-
tional Union Indemnity Co. v. Bruce Bros., Inc.,
44 Ariz. 454, 38 P.2d 648, 652. Expression denotes
that the parties to the transaction have gone
through the form of making a contract, but that
none has been made in law because of lack of
some essential element of a contract, and such
contract creates no legal rights and either party
thereto may ignore it at his pleasure, in so far as
it is executory. Griffin v. Smith, C.C.A.Ind., 101
F.2d 348, 350.

## VOID IN PART, VOID IN TOTO

Curtis v. Lea-
vitt, 15 N.Y. 9, 96.

## VOID JUDGMENT

One which has no legal force
or effect, invalidity of which may be asserted by
any person whose rights are affected at any time
and at any place directly or collaterally. Reynolds
v. Volunteer State Life Ins. Co., Tex.Civ.App., 80
S.W.2d 1087, 1092. One which, from its inception
is and forever continues to be absolutely null,
without legal efficacy, ineffectual to bind parties
or support a right, of no legal force and effect
whatever, and incapable of confirmation, ratifica-
tion, or enforcement in any manner or to any de-
144. One that has merely semblance without
some essential elements, as want of jurisdiction or
failure to serve process or have party in court.
Wellons v. Lassiter, 200 N.C. 474, 157 S.E. 434,
436. It is subject to collateral attack. Owens
v. Cocroft, 14 Ga.App. 322, 80 S.E. 906, 907.

## VOID MARRIAGE

One not good for any legal
purpose, the invalidity of which may be main-
tained in any proceeding between any parties,

is an imperfection which can be inquired into
only during the lives of both of the parties in a
proceeding to obtain a sentence declaring it void.
State v. Smith, 101. S.C. 293, 85 S.E. 958, 959, Ann.
Cas.1917C, 149.

annulled in direct proceedings, but "void marriage" is

Pridgen, 203 N.C. 533, 166 S.E. 591, 593.

## VOID PROCESS

One which fails in some ma-
terial respect to comply with the requisite form
of legal process. United States v. Van Dusen, C.

plish the thing sought to be accomplished, until
the fatal vice in the transaction has been judicially
ascertained and declared. Slaughter v. Qualls,
Tex., 162 S.W.2d 671, 674. It imports a valid act
which may be avoided rather than an invalid
act which may be confirmed. Paulson v. McMillan,
8 Wash.2d 295, 111 P.2d 983, 985. See Void.

## VOIDABLE CONTRACT

One which is void as to
wrongdoer but not void as to wronged party, un-

ease to resist the impulse to commit the criminal
act. State v. Jackson, 346 Mo. 474, 142 S.W.2d 45,
VOLUIT, SED NON DIXIT. He willed, but he did
not say. He may have intended so, but he did not
say so. A maxim frequently used in the construc-
tion of wills, an answer to arguments based upon
the supposed intention of a testator. 2 Pow.Dev.
625; 4 Kent, Comm. 538.

quently prepared, by making the entries at great-
er length. Brown.

ualty Co. of New York, 227 Ky. 114, 12 S.W.2d 298,
