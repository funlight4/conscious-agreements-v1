Certain statutes are called "statutes of amendments and

(jeofaile,) he is at liberty, by those statutes, to amend it.
:1 111.Comm. -107: 1 Sound. p. 228, no. 1.
Jeofaile is when the parties to any suit in pleading have
proceeded so far that they have joined issue which shall
be tried or is tried by a jury or inquest, and this pleading
or issue is so badly pleaded or joined that it will be error
if they proceed. Then some of the said parties may, by
their counsel, show it to the court, as well after verdict

take." And if it be after verdict, then he may say : "To
judgment you ought not to go." Termer de la Ley.

Defendant is not in "jeopardy" until jury has been duly
impaneled and charged with his deliverance, but convic-
tion or acquittal by any competent tribunal, whether after
jury trial or not, satisfies requirement of jeopardy. Pepin
v. State ex rel. Chambers, 217 Wis. 568, 259 N.W. 410.
The terms "jeopardy of life and liberty for the
same offense," "jeopardy of life or limb," "jeopar-
dy for the same offense," "in jeopardy of punish.
ment," and other similar provisions used in the

Jetsam is where goods are cast into the sea, and there
sink and remain under water. 1 BI.Comm. 292.
The sense of "goods thrown overboard and sunk at sea"

age of a ship or its cargo found floating on the sea. Web-
ster, Diet.

single question of law and fact common to all the
complainants, as where in a suit to quiet title they

## JOINT DEBTORS' ACTS

several defendants, the court may, in its discre-
tion, render judgment against one or more of
them, leaving the action to proceed against the
others, whenever a several judgment is proper."
The name is also given to statutes providing that
where an action is instituted against two or more
defendants upon an alleged joint liability, and
some of them are served with process, but juris-
diction is not obtained over the others, the plaintiff
may still proceed to trial against those who are be-
fore the court, and, if he recovers, may have judg-
ment against all of the defendants whom he shows
to be jointly liable. 1 Black, Judgm. §§ 208, 235.

the journal is a daily record of the proceedings of either

## JOURNEY

Originally, a day's travel. The word
is now applied to a travel by land from place to
place, without restriction of time. But, when thus
applied, it is employed to designate a travel which
is without the ordinary habits, business, or duties

reach the court; hence the name of journeys ac-
count, that is, journeys accomptes or counted.
Co.Litt. fol. 9b; English v. T. H. Rogers Lumber

said to be in judicio, as those before the prtor
were said to be in jure. A judge who conducted
the trial from beginning to end; magistrates.
The practice of calling in judices was disused before
Justinian's time: therefore, in the Code, Institutes, and

very different significations at different periods of Roman
law.

mined only questions of fact. 3 B1.Comm. 315.

## JUDEX PEDANEUS

In Roman law. Inferior

first of the definitions here given, People v. Wilson, 15 Ill.
388; and it has been held that a surrogate is not a "judge"

properly denominated an "opinion."

An order may be a judgment: Compensation proceed-
ing. Truax-Traer Coal Co. v. Compensation Com'r, 123 W.
Va. 621, 17 S.E.2d 330, 334; Traders & General Ins. Co. v.

373; Gutierrez v. Brady, 45 N.M. 209, 113 P.2d 585, 537;
but in a different context may not be synonymous. Men-
nel Milling Co. v. Slosser, 140 Ohio St. 445, 45 N.E.2d 306,

Winkelman v. General Motors Corporation, D.C.N.Y., 48
F.Supp. 490, 494. A written decision that finally deter-
mines rights of parties is a "judgment". Zbikowski v. Straz,

lent of a "judgment" of a court. Elliott v. Thompson,
63 Idaho 395, 120 P.2d 1014, 1022. Decisions of administra-
tive boards are not "judgments". Dal Maso v. Board of
Com'rs of Prince George's County, 182 Md. 200, 34 A.2d
464, 466. The decision of the court, when filed, amounts
to rendition of judgment. Lind v. Baker, 48 Cal.App.2d
234, 119 P.2d 806, 812.
To constitute act of bankruptcy, "judgment" suffered
by debtor must be one that has become lien and, as such,
a legal preference. Elkay Reflector Corporation v. Savory,
Inc., C.C.A.N.Y., 57 F.2d 161, 162.
Judgments, considered with regard to the meth-
od of obtaining them, may be classified as follows.
Admission of facts by the parties, leaving only
issues of law to be determined. Such judgments
are: judgment upon a demurrer; judgment on a
case stated; judgment on a general verdict sub-
ject to a special case; judgment on a special ver-
Admissions or confessions of one only of the
parties; judgments based on. Such judgments
when for defendant upon the admissions of the
plaintiff are: judgment of nolle prosequi; judg-
ment of retraxit; judgment on leave of court to
discontinue; a stet processus. Judgments for the
plaintiff upon facts admitted by the defendant are:
judgment by cognovit actionem; cognovit or con-
fession.
Trial of an issue of fact. Judgments upon facts
found are: Judgment of nul tiel record; judgment
upon verdict; judgment non obstante veredicto;
judgment of repleader.
Alternative judgment. One that by its terms
might be satisfied by doing either of several acts
at the election of the party or parties against
whom the judgment is rendered and from whom
performance is by the judgment required. Hen-
derson v. Arkansas, 71 Okl. 253, 176 P. 751, 754.
A judgment for one thing or another which does
not specifically and in a definitive manner deter-
mine the rights of the parties. State v. Wilson,
216 N.C. 130, 4 S.E.2d 440, 442.
Assets in futuro, judgment of. One against an
executor or heir, who holds at the time no prop-
erty on which it can operate. See Quando Acci-
derint.
Case stated, judgment on. It sometimes hap-
pens that though the adverse parties are agreed
as to the facts, and only differ as to the law aris-
ing out of them, still these facts do not so clearly
appear on the pleadings as to enable them to ob-
tain the opinion of the court by way of demurrer;
for on demurrer the court can look at nothing
whatever except the pleadings. In such circum-
stances the statute 3 & 4 Will. IV. c. 42, § 25,
which has been imitated in most of the states, al-
lows them after issue joined, and on obtaining the
consent of a single judge, to state the facts in a
special case for the opinion of the court, and
agree that a judgment shall be entered for the
plaintiff or defendant by confession or nolle pro-
sequi immediately after the decision of the case;
and judgment is entered accordingly, called judg-
ment on a case stated.
Cassetur breve or billa, judgment of (that the
writ or bill be quashed) is a judgment rendered
in favor of a party pleading in abatement to a
writ or action. Steph.Pl. 130, 131.
Cognovit. See Cognovit.
Cognovit actionem. See Cognovit Actionem.
Conditional judgment. One whose force de-
pends upon the performance of certain acts to be
done in the future by one of the parties; as, one
which may become of no effect if the defendant
appears and pleads according to its terms, or one
which orders the sale of mortgaged property in a
foreclosure proceeding unless the mortgagor shall
pay the amount decreed within the time limited.
Mahoney v. New South Building & Loan Ass'n,
C.C.Va., 70 F. 513; Simmons v. Jones, 118 N.C.
Confession. At common law, judgment enter-
ed where defendant, instead of entering plea, con-
fessed action, or withdrew plea and confessed ac-
tion. Information Buying Co. v. Miller, 173 Ga.
786, 161 S.E. 617, 618. Judgment where a defend-
ant gives the plaintiff a cognovit or written con-
fession of the action by virtue of which the plain-
tiff enters judgment. The act of a debtor in per-
mitting judgment to be entered against him by his
creditor, for a stipulated sum, by a written state-
ment to that effect or by warrant of attorney, with-
out the institution of legal proceedings of any
kind; voluntary submission to court's jurisdiction.
O'Hara v. Manley, 140 Pa.Super. 39, 12 A.2d 820,

Ky. 198, 66 S.W.2d 59; Andrews v. Indemnity Ins.
Co. of North America, 55 R.I. 341, 181 A. 403;
Matthews v. Looney, 132 Tex. 313, 123 S.W.2d 871,
It is not the judgment of the court, it is the agreement
of the parties, entered upon the record with the sanction
and approval of the court, and is their act rather than
that of the court. Andrews v. Indemnity Ins. Co. of North
America, 55 R.I. 341, 181 A. 403; Cason v. Shutte, 211 N.
C. 195, 189 S.E. 494, 495.
Consent judgments are, in effect, merely contracts ac-
knowledged in open court and ordered to be recorded, but
as such they bind the parties as fully as do other judg-
ments. Prince v. Frost-Johnson Lumber Co., Tex.Civ.
App., 250 S.W. 785, 789; Belcher v. Cobb, 169 N.C. 689, 86
S.E. 600, 602.
Contradictory judgment. A judgment which
has been given after the parties have been heard,
either in support of their claims or in their de-
fense. Cox's Ex'rs v. Thomas, 11 La. 366.
It is used in Louisiana to distinguish such judgments
from those rendered by default.
De melioribus damnis. See De Melioribus
Damnis.
Default and inquiry, judgment by. It estab-
lishes right of action of kind properly pleaded in

225 P. 495, 496; Brame v. Nolen, 139 Va. 413, 124
S.E. 299, 301. One entered upon the failure of a
party to appear or plead at the appointed time.
The term is also applied to judgments entered un-
der statutes or rules of court, for want of affidavit
of defense, plea, answer, and the like, or for fail-
Judgments rendered on defendant's default are: Judg-
ment by default; judgment by non sum informatus;
judgment nil licit. Judgments rendered on plaintiff's de-
fault are: Judgment of non pros. (from non prosequitur)
and judgment of nonsuit (from non sequitur, or ne suit
pas).

murring, because by demurring, a party admits
the facts alleged in the pleadings of his adversary
and relies on their insufficiency in law. See De-
murrer.
Discontinuance. A "judgment of discontinuance"
is one of dismissal of plaintiff's action based on
interruption in proceedings occasioned by failure
of plaintiff to continue suit regularly from time to
time as he ought. Steele v. Beaty, 215 N.C. 680,
2 S.E.2d 854, 855.
A plaintiff sometimes, when he finds he has miscon-
ceived his action, obtains leave from the court to discon-
tinue, on which there is a judgment against him and he
has to pay costs; but he may commence a new action for
the same cause.
Dismissal, judgment of. See Dismissal.
Domestic judgment. A judgment is domestic
in the courts of the same state or country where
it was originally rendered; in other states or
countries it is called foreign. The federal court
sitting for the state is a domestic court, and its
judgments within the scope of its jurisdiction are
domestic judgments. Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Tal-
ly, 203 Ala. 370, 83 So. 114, 117.
Dormant judgment. One which has not been sat-
isfied or extinguished by lapse of time, but which
has remained so long unexecuted that execution
cannot now be issued upon it without first reviv-
ing the judgment. Draper v. Nixon, 93 Ala. 436,
8 So. 489; General Electric Co. v. Hurd, C.C.Or.,
171 F. 984; Burlington State Bank v. Marlin Nat.
Bank, Tex.Civ.App., 207 S.W. 954, 956. Or one

Black, Judgm. (2d Ed.) § 462.
Error, judgment in. A judgment rendered by a
court of error on a record sent up from an in-
ferior court.
It is either in affirmance of the former judgment; in
recall of it for error in fact; in reversal of it for error in
law ; that the plaintiff be barred of his writ of error,
where a plea of release of errors or of the statute of limi-
tations is found for the defendant ; or that there be a
venire facias de novo, which is an award of a new trial.
Execution of judgment. See Execution of Judg-
ment or Decree.
Face of judgment. See Face of Judgment.
Final judgment. One which puts an end to a
suit or action.
One which puts an end to an action at law by declaring
that the plaintiff either has or has not entitled himself to
recover the remedy he sues for. 3 Bl.Comm. 398; Frank
P. Miller Paper Co. v. Keystone Coal & Coke Co., 275 Pa.
40, 118 A. 565, 566. So distinguished from interlocutory judg-
recover, in general terms. Id. 397. A judgment which
determines a particular cause. Bostwick v. Brinkerhoff,
106 U.S. 3, 1 S. Ct. 15, 27 L.Ed. 73; Pfeiffer v. Crane, 89
Ind. 487; Nelson v. Brown, 59 Vt. 601, 10 A. 721. A judg-
ment which cannot be appealed from, which is perfectly
conclusive upon the matter adjudicated. Snell v. Cotton
Gin Mfg. Co., 24 Pick., Mass., 300; Foster v. Neilson, 2
Pet. 294, 7 L.Ed. 415; Forgay v. Conrad, 6 How. 201, 12
L.Ed. 404; State v. Harmon, 87 Ohio St. 364, 101 N.E.
286, 288. A judgment which disposes of the subject-matter
of the controversy or determines the litigation as to all
parties on its merits. Lamberton v. McCarthy, 30 Idaho,
707, 168 P. 11; Sanders v. May, 173 N. C. 47, 91 S.E. 526,
527; France & Canada S. S. Co. v. French Republic, C.C.A.
N.Y., 285 F. 290, 294; Judson Lumber Co. v. Patterson, 68

Trust Co., Tex.Civ.App., 241 S.W. 540, 541. A judgment
which terminates all litigation on the same right. For
meaning of "final judgment", in the judiciary act of 1789,
§ 25, see 1 Kent., Comm. 316; Weston v. Charleston, 2 Pet.
494, 7 L.Ed. 481; Forgay v. Conrad, 6 How. 201, 209, 12
L.Ed. 404.

fect is brought in question. One pronounced by a
tribunal of a foreign country, or of a sister state.

Sewing Mach. Co. v. Radcliffe, 137 U.S. 287, 11 S.
Ct. 92, 34 L.Ed. 670.
General verdict subject to a special case, judg-
ment on. Where at the trial the parties agree on
the facts and the only question is one of law and
a verdict pro forma is taken and the jury find for
the plaintiff generally but subject to the opinion
of the court on a special case.
In personam or inter partes. See Judgment in
Personam or Inter Partes.
In rem. See Judgment in Rem.
Interlocutory judgment. One given in the pro-
gress of a cause upon some plea, proceeding, or
default which is only intermediate and does not
finally determine or complete the suit. 3 Bl.Comm.
396. One which determines some preliminary or
subordinate point or plea, or settles some step,
question, or default arising in the progress of the
cause, but does not adjudicate the ultimate rights
of the parties, or finally put the case out of court.
Thus, a judgment or order passed upon any pro-
visional or accessory claim or contention is, in
general, merely interlocutory, although it may
finally dispose of that particular matter. 1 Black,
Judgm. § 21; Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. McDonald,
177 Ky, 838, 198 S.W. 225, 226; Frank P. Miller

entered after the rendition or entry of another
judgment, on a different claim, against the same
defendant.

ment and investigation, and when it is determined

a judgment rendered upon some preliminary or
formal or merely technical point, or by default
Ky. 21, 61 S.W.2d 879; State ex rel. National Lead
Co. v. Smith, Mo.App., 134 S.W.2d 1061, 1068.
Money judgment. One which adjudges the pay-
ment of a sum of money, as distinguished from
one directing an act to be done or property to be
restored or transferred. Fuller v. Aylesworth,
Mich., 75 F. 694, 21 C.C.A. 505; Pendleton v. Cline,
85 Cal. 142, 24 P. 659.
Ordinary "judgment for money" merely determines
amount due. State ex rel. Lang v. Superior Court for
King County, 176 Wash. 472, 30 P.2d 237, 239.
Narr and cognovit, judgment on. Summons is
unnecessary because maker of note authorizes
appearance and waives summons. Schwartz v.
Schwartz, 366 Ill. 247, 8 N.E.2d 668, 670, 112 A.L.R.
Nihil dicit. See Nihil Dicit.

nothing by his writ, or by his bill). A judgment
in favor of the defendant upon an issue raised
upon a declaration or peremptory plea.
Nil dicit, judgment by. One rendered where
defendant fails to plead, or where, having pleaded,
plea is stricken, withdrawn, or abandoned and
no further defense is made. Grand Lodge Bro-
therhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Ware, Tex.Civ.
App., 73 S.W.2d 1076, 1077; Reliance Equipment
Co. v. Montgomery, 27 Ala.App. 539, 175 So. 703.
At common law, it may be taken against defendant who
omits to plead or answer whole or any separable substan-
tial portion of declaration. Clonts v. Spurway, 104 Fla.
340, 139 So. 896, 897. It amounts to judgment by confes-
sion with reference to cause of action stated, Grand Lodge
Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Ware, Tex.Civ.App.,
'73 S.W.2d 1076, 1077. For judgment nihil dicit, see Nihil
Dicit. Judgment rendered on plea of guilty is not judg-
ment nil dicit, which is substantially identical with de-
fault judgment. Stevens v. State, 100 Vt. 214, 136 A. 387.
Nisi. At common law, judgment nisi was a
judgment entered on the return of the nisi prius
record, which, according to the terms of the postea
indorsed thereon was to become absolute unless
otherwise ordered by the court within the first four
days of the next succeeding term. See U. S. v.
Winstead, D.C.N.C., 12 F. 51; Young v. McPher-
son, 3 N.J.L. 897.
Nolle prosequi, judgment of. One entered
against plaintiff when, after appearance and be-
fore judgment, he declares that he will not fur-
ther prosecute his suit. Steph. Pl., Andr. Ed. § 97;

Personal judgment. One imposing on the de-
fendant a personal liability to pay it, and which
may therefore be satisfied out of any of his prop-
erty which is within the reach of process, as dis-
tinguished from one which may be satisfied only
out of a particular fund or the proceeds of parti-
cular property.
Thus, in a mortgage foreclosure suit, there may be a
personal judgment against the mortgagor for any de-
ficiency that may remain after the sale of the mortgaged
premises. See Bardwell v. Collins, 44 Minn. 97, 46 N.W.
315, 9 L.R.A. 152.

es on a dilatory plea, and is determined for the
plaintiff, the judgment is only that the defendant

Retraxit. See Retraxit.
Special verdict, judgment on. Where at the trial
the parties find that they agree on the facts and
the only question is one of law and a verdict pro

they find them, concluding that the opinion of
the court shall decide in whose favor the verdict
shall be, and that they assess the damages accord-
ingly.

59 N.W. 523, 28 L.R.A. 621.

## JUDGMENT CREDITOR

One who has obtained
can enforce execution. King v. Fraser, 23 S.C.
548; Baxter v. Moses, 77 Me. 465, 1 A. 350, 52 Am.
Rep. 783; Chalmers & Williams v. Surprise, 70
Ind.App. 646, 123 N.E. 841, 844. Code Civ.Proc.
N.Y.1899, § 3343 (Civ.Prac. Act, § 7). The owner
of an unsatisfied judgment.

## JUDGMENT DEBT

One which is evidenced by
matter of record. Colonial Building-Loan Ass'n
v. Mongiello Bros., 120 N.J.Eq. 270, 184 A. 635, 637.

tered up, either upon a cognovit or upon a war-
rant of attorney or as the result of a successful
action. Brown.

A person against whom
judgment has been recovered, and which remains
unsatisfied. The term has been construed to in-
clude a judgment debtor's successors in interest.
Bateman v. Kellogg, 59 Cal.App. 464, 211 P. 46, 51;
but see, contra, Northwest Trust & Safe Deposit
Co. v. Butcher, 98 Wash. 158, 167 P. 46, 47.

## JUDGMENT DEBTOR SUMMONS

Under the
English bankruptcy act, 1861, §§ 76-85, these sum-
monses might be issued against both traders and
non-traders, and, in default of payment of, or se-
curity or agreed composition for, the debt, the
debtors might be adjudicated bankrupt. This act
was repealed by 32 & 33 Vict. c. 83, § 20. The 32
& 33 Vict. c. 71, however, (bankruptcy act, 1869,)
provides (section 7) for the granting of a "debt-
or's summons," at the instance of creditors, and,
in the event of failure to pay or compound, a pe-
tition for adjudication may be presented, unless in
the events provided for by that section. Wharton.

## JUDGMENT DOCKET

A list or docket of the
judgments entered in a given court, methodically
kept by the clerk or other proper officer, open to
public inspection, and intended to afford official
notice to interested parties of the existence or lien
of judgments.

## JUDGMENT, ESTOPPEL BY

The estoppel raised
by the rendition of a valid judgment by a court
having jurisdiction. 2 Bl.Judgm. § 504; State v.
Torinus, 28 Minn. 175, 9 N.W. 725. See, also, Ver-
dict, Judgment By.
Final adjudication of any issue by court of competent
jurisdiction binds parties and privies in any subsequent
proceeding, irrespective of difference in forms or causes
of action. Citizens' Loan & Trust Co. of Washington, Ind.
v. Sanders, 99 Ind.App. 77, 187 N.E. 396, 398.
The essence of estoppel by judgment is that there has
been a judicial determination of a fact. Price v. Clement,
187 Okl. 304, 102 P.2d 595, 597; Monteith Bros. Co. v.
U. S., D.C.Ind., 48 F.Supp. 210, 212. It arises where a par-
ty litigant attempts to assume inconsistent and contradic-
tory positions with respect to same matter. Elfman v.
Glaser, 313 Mass. 370, 47 N.E.2d 925, 929. It rests upon
principles forbidding one to relitigate matter in dispute
between parties which has been determined by competent
court, on ground that record of judgment imports absolute
verity. Cauble v. Cauble, Tex.Civ.App., 2 S.W.2d 967, 970.
The doctrine extends to matters actually adjudicated,
Hamlin v. Johns, 41 Ga.App. 91, 151 S.E. 815, 817; Penn
Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Childs, 189 Ga. 835, 7 S.E.2d 907;
actually and necessarily included in judgment, MacDonnell
v. Capital Co., C.C.A.Cal., 130 F.2d 311, 318; Panos v.
expressly or by necessary Implication adjudicated, McKee
v. Producers' & Refiners' Corporation, 170 Okl. 559, 41 P.2d
466, 469; necessarily adjudicated, Capps v. Toccoa Falls
Light & Power Co., 46 Ga.App. 268, 167 S.E. 530, 532;
Humble Oil & Refining Co. v. Webb, Tex.Civ.App., 177 S.
W.2d 218, 223. It extends only to facts in issue as they
existed at time judgment was rendered, Fort Worth Stock-
yards Co. v. Brown, Tex.Civ.App., 161 S.W.2d 549, 555.
It extends' to matters which might have been litigated in
former case. Paine & Williams Co. v. Baldwin Rubber
Co., C.C.A.Mich., 113 F.2d 840, 842, 843; Knabb v. Duner,
143 Fla. 92, 196 So. 456, 460. But it has been held that the
doctrine does not apply where point at issue was not con-
troverted in prior action but might have been. Haumesser
v. Woodrich, 315 475, 43 N.E.2d 193, 196; the es-
toppel does not extend to matter not directly in issue
though it arose in case collaterally. Morrison v. Bank of
Mount Hope, 124 W.Va. 478, 20 S.E.2d 790, 794.
Ordinarily, "estoppel" at judgment does not extenCtO
matters not expressly adjudicated, Sonken-Galamba Cor-
poration v. Atchison, T. & S. F. Ry. Co., C.C.A.Mo., 124
F.2d 952, 956; and a judgment or decree without prejudice
does not work an "estoppel". In re McDermott, C.C.A.
Ill., 115 F.2d 582, 584.
Elements or essentials are or may include former judg-
ment between same parties or their privies. Postelneck v.
Edbro Realty Co., 228 App.Div. 105, 239 N.Y.S. 173, 175;
former judgment must relate to same question and must
clearly decide it, First Nat. Bank of Atlanta v. Williams,
62 Ga.App. 203, 8 S.E.2d 562, 564, 565; former judgment
on the merits, Stowers v. Harris, 194 Ga. 636, 22 S.E.2d
405, 408; Postelneck v. Edbro Realty Co., 228 App.Div. 105,
239 N.Y.S. 173, 175; identity of parties suing in same ca-
pacity, Ford v. Dania Lumber & Supply Co., 150 Fla. 435,
7 So.2d 594, 595; material facts necessary in arriving at
conclusion must be properly in issue, Paine & Williams Co.
v. Baldwin Rubber Co., C.C.A.Mich., 113 F.2d 840, 842, 843;
matters litigated and determined in prior case must have
been within scope of the pleadings, Slaughter v. Slaughter,
190 Ga. 229, 9 S.E.2d 70, 71, 129 A.L.R. 156; mutuality of
estoppel, Stewart v. City of Springfield, 350 Mo. 234, 165
S.W.2d 626, 630; Elder v. New York & Pennsylvania Motor
Express, 284 N.Y. 350, 31 N.E.2d 188, 189, 133 A.L.R. 176;
precise facts or questions must have been determined by
former judgment, Skolnik v. Petella, 376 Ill. 500, 34 N.E.2d
825, 826; Flint v. Kimbrough, 45 N.M. 342, 115 P.2d 84, 86;
subsequent suit must be between same parties or their
privies. Harris v. Jacksonville Paper Co., 67 Ga.App. 759,
21 S.E.2d 537, 541; Woods v. Duval, 151 Kan. 472, 99 P.2d
804, 808; substantial identity of parties, Curtis v. Mary-
land Baptist Union Ass'n, 176 Md. 430, 5 A.2d 836, 839, 121
A.L.R. 1516.
The estoppel may be based on consent judgment, Le
Bire v. Department of Labor and Industries, 14 Wash.2d
407, 128 P.2d 308, 313; declaratory judgment, In re Pat-
ton's Estate, 170 Or. 186, 132 P.2d 402, 406; default judg-
ment, Lawhorn v. WeIlford, 179 Tenn. 625, 168 S.W.2d
790, 792; erroneous judgment regularly entered by court.
Ex parte Young, 222 N.C. 708, 24 S.E.2d 539, 540; fin•_
judgment, Ramsey Tp., McCook County v. Lake County,
68 S.D. 67, 298 N.W. 356; final judgment in a criminal
prosecution or proceeding, Ex parte Lewis, 152 Kan. 13,
102 P.2d 981, 982; judgment in rem, or quasi in rem,
Saunders v. King, 69 Ohio App. 313, 37 N.E.2d 92, 93;
judgment upon stipulation, Tillman v. National City Bank
of New York, C.C.A.N.Y., 118 F.2d 631, 633, 634, 635;
judgment upon the merits, Smith v. C. I. T. Corporation,
69 Ga.App. 516, 26 S.E.2d 146, 148; Fightmaster v. Tauber,
43 Ohio App. 266, 183 N.E. 116, 117.
When causes of action or claims or demands in prior
and subsequent suits are different the estoppel exists with
respect to matters actually decided and essential to or
necessarily involved in judgment, Balcom v. Cain, Tex.
Civ.App., 81 S.W.2d 827, 829; actually litigated, American
Trust Co. v. Butler, C.C.A.Fla., 47 F.2d 482, 483; Vaughn's
Adm'r v. Louisville & N. R. Co., 297 Ky. 309, 179 S.W.2d
441, 444, 152 A.L.R. 1060; common to both causes of ac-
tion, McKee v. Producers' & Refiners' Corporation, 170 Okl.
559, 41 P.2d 466, 469; Guaranty Trust Co. of New York
v. International Trust Co., 144 Misc. 127, 258 N.Y.S. 465;
necessarily adjudicated, Bassick Mfg. Co. v. Larkin Auto-
motive Parts Co., D.C.I11., 23 F.2d 92, 94; McDowell v.
tion between same parties a former adjudication is conclu-
sive. Kimpton v. Spellman, 351 Mo. 674, 173 S.W.2d 886,
JUDGMENT EXECUTION. In the judgment on
which it issues, it is a species of execution process,
but as to the garnishee who becomes a party de-
fendant therein it is an original process-a sum-
mons commanding him to appear and show cause,
if any he has, why judgment in favor of the plain-
tiff should not be levied on the goods and effects
of defendant in his hands. Shane v. Commercial
Casualty Ins. Co., D.C.Pa., 48 F.Supp. 151, 156.

## JUDGMENT IN PERSONAM OR INTER PAR- TES

A judgment against a particular person, as
distinguished from a judgment against a thing or
a right or status.
Judgments of the former class, though conclusive even
against strangers, as to the fact of their rendition and the
resultant legal consequences, are not binding as to the is-
sues involved, except upon the parties and their privies,
while judgments of the latter class are conclusive upon all
the world. City of Huntsville v. Goodenrath, 13 Ala.App.
579, 68 So. 676, 680. See the title Judgment In Rem.
Decrees of divorce of other states recovered upon service
by publication are not judgments in personam. Ball v.
Cross, 106 Misc. 184, 174 N.Y.S. 259, 260.

## JUDGMENT IN REM

An adjudication pro-
nounced upon the status of some particular thing
or subject matter. Perry v. Edmonds, 59 Nev. 60,
84 P.2d 711, 713; Consolidated Flour Mills Co. of
Kansas v. Sayre Wholesale Grocer Co., 176 Okl.
482, 56 P.2d 781, 784; by a tribunal having com-
petent authority. Booth v. Copley, 283 Ky. 23,
140 S.W.2d 662, 666. It is founded on proceeding
instituted against or on some thing or subject mat-
ter whose status or condition is to be determined,
McCormick v. Blaine, 345 Ill. 461, 178 N.E. 195, 197,
77 A.L.R. 1215; Eureka Building & Loan Ass'n v.
Shultz, 139 Kan. 435, 32 P.2d 477, 480; or one
brought to enforce a right in the thing itself, Fed-
eral Land Bank of Omaha v. Jefferson, 229 Iowa
1054, 295 N.W. 855, 857; Hobbs v. Lenon, 191 Ark.
509, 87 S.W.2d 6, 11. It operates directly upon the
property. Federal Land Bank of Omaha v. Jeffer-
son, 229 Iowa 1054, 295 N.W. 855, 857, 132 A.L.R.
1282; Hobbs v. Lenon, 191 Ark. 509, 87 S.W.2d 6,
11; Guild v. Wallis, 150 Or. 69, 40 P.2d 737, 742.
It is a solemn declaration of the status of some
person or thing. Jones v. Teat, Tex.Civ.App., 57
S.W.2d 617, It is binding upon all persons in
so far as their interests in the property are con-
cerned. Federal Land Bank of Omaha v. Jefferson,
229 Iowa 1054, 295 N.W. 855, 857, 132 A.L.R. 1282.
It is binding upon the world. Booth v. Copley, 283
Ky. 23, 140 S.W.2d 662, 666; Hobbs v. Lenon, 191
Ark. 509, 87 S.W.2d 6, 11.
Various definitions have been given of a judgment in
rem, but all are criticised as either incomplete or com-
prehending too much.
"A very able writer says : 'The distinguishing charac-
teristic of judgments in rem is that, wherever their obliga-
tion is recognized and enforced as against any person, it Is
equally recognized and enforced as against all persons.'
It seems to us that the true definition of a 'judgment in
rem' is 'an adjudication' against some person or thing, or
upon the status of some subject-matter; which, wherever
and whenever binding upon any person, is equally binding
upon all persons." Bartero v. Real Estate Savings Bank,
10 Mo.App. 78.
In Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U.S. 734, 24 L. Ed. 565, the court
said : "It is true that, in a strict sense, a proceeding in
rem is one taken directly against property, and has for its
object the disposition of property, without reference to
the title of individual claimants; but, in a larger and more
general sense, the terms are applied to actions between
parties, where the direct object is to reach and dispose of
property owned by them, or of some interest therein.
Such are cases commenced by attachment against the prop-
erty of debtors, or instituted to partition real estate, fore-
close a mortgage, or enforce a lien. So far as they affect
property in this state, they are substantially proceedings in
rem in the broader sense which we have mentioned."
JUDGMENT IN RETRAXIT. A "judgment" which
is usually based upon and follows a settlement out
of court, and like a judgment on the merits is a
bar and estops plaintiff from again proceeding in
another suit on same cause of action. Steele v.
Beaty, 215 N.C. 680, 2 S.E.2d 854, 856, 857.
See Retraxit.

## JUDGMENT LIEN

A lien binding the real estate
of a judgment debtor, in favor of the holder of
the judgment, and giving the latter a right to levy
on the land for the satisfaction of his judgment to

tice, having chiefly original jurisdiction; and her ma-
jesty's court of appeal, whose jurisdiction is chiefly appel-
late.

198, 33 N.Y.S.2d 629, 630, 631.

cer does not become judicial simply because it
requires some discretion and judgment, but be-

Lamp Heater Co. v. Monitor Oil Stove Co., 41 Ohio
St. 293. When an inferior officer or board is

tion and determination of such facts is so-called
judicial action. Austin v. Eddy, 41 S.D. 640, 172

being judges or retired judges, which acts as the
king's adviser in matters of law referred to it, and

dicature act of 1873.
It consists of the Lord Chancellor, the six Lords of Ap-
peal, if Privy Councillors, and such other members of the
Privy Council as have held any high judicial office in the
United Kingdom, India, or the colonies. It is the court
of final appeal from the ecclesiastical courts, from the
courts of India, the colonies, dominions, etc., the Channel
Islands and the Isle of Man, administering all the different
systems of law of the countries under its appellate juris-
diction, and exercising a notable influence on the tenor

jurisdiction being usually provided in each of such
districts, and the boundaries of the• district mark-

separate and independent county courts, but in
that case they are presided over by the same
judge. See Ex parte Gardner, 22 Nev. 280, 39 P.

42 S.W.2d 21, 22.

## JUDICIAL ERRORS

Errors into which the court
itself falls are "judicial errors." An error of this
character occurs when the judgment rendered is
erroneous in some particular, requiring it to be
changed. Connecticut Mortgage & Title Guaranty
Co. v. Di Francesco, 112 Conn. 673, 151 A. 491, 492.

## JUDICIAL ESTOPPEL

statements made in course of judicial proceedings.
Clarke v. Ripley Say. Bank & Trust Co., 27 Tenn.
App. 387, 181 S.W.2d 386, 389; Helfer v. Mutual
Benefit Health & Accident Ass'n, 170 Tenn. 630, 96
S.W.2d 1103, 1105, 113 A.L.R. 921. The doctrine of
"judicial estoppel" is the doctrine of the conclu-
siveness of the judgments. State v. Ohio Oil Co.,
Tex.Civ.App., 173 S.W.2d 470, 478, 479.
It is based on bad faith, and cannot be asserted unless
sworn statement was made knowingly, or with degree of
negligence authorizing imputation of knowledge. Broyles
v. Scottish Union & National Ins. Co., 16 Tenn.App. 331,
64 S.W. 51:7.
The rule may be invoked only where the prior and sub-
sequent litigation involves the same parties and where
one party has relied on the former testimony and changed
his position by reason of it. Tracy Loan & Trust Co. v.
Openshaw Inv. Co., 102 Utah 509, 132 P.2d 388, 390, 391.
But see holding that judicial estoppel is based on public
policy and not on prejudice to adverse party. Sartain v.

JUDICIAL EVIDENCE is the means, sanctioned
by law, of ascertaining in a judicial proceeding
the truth respecting a question.

## JUDICIAL FUNCTION

The exercise of the ju-
dicial faculty or office. The capacity to act in the
specific way which appertains to the judicial pow-
er, as one of the powers of government.
The term is used to describe generally those modes of
action which appertain to the judiciary as a department of
organized government, and through and by means of which
it accomplishes its purposes and exercises its peculiar
powers. See State v. Kelly, 27 N.M. 412, 202 P. 524, 528,
21 A.L.R. 156; Lyon v. City of Payette, 38 Idaho 705, 224
P. 793, 794; People v. Hersey, 69 Colo. 492, 196 P. 180, 181,
14 A.L.R. 631; Sauskelonis v. Herting, 89 Conn. 298, 94 A.
368, 369. While ordinarily a case or judicial controversy
within the meaning of Const. art. 3, § 2, results in a judg-
ment requiring award of process of execution to carry it
into effect, such relief is not an indispensable adjunct to
the exercise of the "judicial function." Fidelity Nat.
Bank & Trust Co. of Kansas City v. Swope, 274 U.S. 123,
47 S.Ct. 511, 514, 71 L.Ed. 959.

## JUDICIAL INQUIRY

Such inquiry investigates,
declares, and enforces liabilities as they stand on
present or past facts and under laws supposed
already to exist. Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co.
596, 598; In re Turnock's Estate, 238 Wis. 438, 300
N.W. 155, 156.

## JUDICIAL KNOWLEDGE

Knowledge of that
which is so notorious that everybody, including
judges, knows it, and hence need not be proved.
Ex parte Ferguson, 112 Tex.Cr.R. 152, 15 S.W.2d
650, 652.

## JUDICIAL LEGISLATION

See Judge-Made
Law.

## JUDICIAL NOTICE

The act by which a court,
in conducting a trial, or framing its decision, will,
of its own motion, and without the production of
evidence, recognize the existence and truth of
certain facts, having a bearing on the controversy
at bar, which, from their nature, are not properly
the subject of testimony, or which are universal-
ly regarded as established by common notoriety,
e. g., the laws of the state, international law, his-
torical events, the constitution and course of na-
ture, main geographical features, etc. North
Hempstead v. Gregory, 53 App.Div. 350, 65 N.Y.S.
867; State v. Main, 69 Conn. 123, 37 A. 80, 36 L.R.
A. 623, 61 Am.St.Rep. 30. The cognizance of cer-
tain facts which judges and jurors may properly
take and act upon without proof, because they al-
ready know them. United States v. Hammers, D.
C.Fla., 241 F. 542, 543.
The true conception of what is "judicially known" is
that of something which is not, or rather need not be,
unless the tribunal wishes it, the subject of either evidence
or argument. Chiulla de Luca v. Board of Park Com'rs of
City of Hartford, 94 Conn. 7, 107 A. 611, 612. The limits of
"judicial notice" cannot be prescribed with exactness, but
notoriety is, generally speaking, the ultimate test of facts
sought to be brought within the realm of judicial notice;
in general, it covers matters so notorious that a production
of evidence would be unnecessary, matters which the ju-
dicial function supposes the judge to be acquainted with
actually or theoretically, and matters not strictly included
under either of such heads. Gottstein v. Lister, 88 Wash.
462, 153 P. 595, 602, Ann.Cas.1917D, 1008.

## JUDICIAL OATH

See Oath.

A. term used In 34 & 35 Vict. c. 91, to define qualifications
of additional members of the judicial committee of the

## JUDICIAL OFFICER

Holmes, 180 Ga. 397, 179 S.E. 77, 78. One who ex-
ercises judicial function. Adams v. State, 214 Ind.
603, 17 N.E.2d 84, 118 A.L.R. 1095. A person in

## JURISINCEPTOR

## JURISPERITUS

## JURISPRUDENCE

The philosophy of law, or the
science which treats of the principles of positive
law and legal relations.
"The term is wrongly applied to actual systems of law,
or to current views of law, or to suggestions for its amend-
ment, but is the name of a science. This science is a for-
mal, or analytical, rather than a material, one. It is the
science of actual or positive law. It is wrongly divided
into 'general' and 'particular,' or into 'philosophical' and
'historical.' It may therefore be defined as the formal
science of positive law." Holl.Jur. 12.
In the proper sense of the word, "jurisprudence" is the
science of law, namely, that science which has for its
function to ascertain the principles on which legal rules
are based, so as not only to classify those rules in their
proper order, and show the relation in which they stand to
one another, but also to settle the manner in which new or
doubtful cases should be brought under the appropriate
rules. Jurisprudence is more a formal than a material
science. It has no direct concern with questions of moral
or political policy, for they fall under the province of
ethics and legislation; but, when a new or doubtful case
arises to which two different rules seem, when taken lit-
erally, to be equally applicable, it may be, and often is,
the function of jurisprudence to consider the ultimate
effect which would be produced if each rule were applied
to an indefinite number of similar cases, and to choose
that rule which, when so applied, will produce the greatest
advantage to the community. Sweet.
Jurisprudence," see those titles. For equity juris-
prudence, see "Equity."
JURISPRUDENTIA. Lat. In the civil and com-
mon law. Jurisprudence, or legal science.
JURISPRUDENTIA EST DIVINARUM ATQUE
HUMANARUM RERUM NOTITIA, JUST! ATQUE
INJUSTI SCIENTIA. Jurisprudence is the knowl-
edge of things divine and human, the science of
what is right and what is wrong. Dig. 1, 1, 10, 2;
Inst. 1, 1, 1. This definition is adopted by Bracton,
word for word. Bract. fol. 3.
JURISPRUDENTIA LEGIS COMMUNIS AN-
GLUE EST SCIENTIA SOCIALIS ET COPIOSA.
The jurisprudence of the common law of England
is a science social and comprehensive. 7 Coke, 28a.

## JURIST

swering to the Latin "jurisperitus," (q. v.).

## JUROR

N.E. 338, 340. The term may apply to special jurors as
well as members of regular panel. Beavers v. State, 187

serve on juries.

## JURY

In practice. A certain number of men,
selected according to law, and sworn (jurati) to
inquire of certain matters of fact, and declare the
truth upon evidence to be laid before them. This
definition embraces the various subdivisions of
juries; as grand jury, petit jury, common jury,
special jury, coroner's jury, sheriff's jury, (q. v.)
citizens of a particular district, and invested with power to
present or indict a person for a public offense, or to try
a question of fact. Code Civil Proc.Cal. § 190.
As understood at common law and as used in constitu-
tional provision, "jury" imports body of twelve men. State
v. Dalton, 206 N.C. 507, 174 S.E. 422, 424; People ex rel.
Cooley v. Wilder, 255 N.Y.S. 218, 222, 234 App.Div. 256;
Hall v. Brown, 129 Kan. 859, 284 P. 396.
"Jury trial" is not merely a trial by twelve men, but by
twelve men selected by law, with judge who passes on
many legal questions and has limited supervision over
trial. Universal Truck Loading Co. v. Taylor, 178 Miss.
143, 172 So. 756, 757.
The right to "jury trial" guaranteed by Federal Consti-
tution is the right of trial by jury as it existed at common
law. Diederich v. American News Co., C.C.A.Okl., 128
F.2d 144, 145, 146.
The right to "jury trial" of controverted issues implies
a trial by an impartial and qualified jury. Alexander v.
R. D. Crier & Sons Co., 181 Md. 415, 30 A.2d 757, 759.
The "jury trial" guaranteed by Federal Constitution
means trial by jury of 12 men in presence and under
superintendence of judge empowered to instruct them on
the law and advise them on the facts and, except on acquit-
tal of criminal charge, to set aside their verdict if in
judge's opinion it is contrary to law or evidence. Died-
erich v. American News Co., C.C.A.Okl., 128 F.2d 144, 145,
The terms "jury" and "trial by jury," as used in the
constitution, mean twelve competent men, disinterested
and impartial, not of kin, nor personal dependents of
either of the parties, having their homes within thekjuris-
dictional limits of the court, drawn and selected by officers
free from all bias in favor of or against either party, duly
impaneled and sworn to render a true verdict according to
the law and the evidence. State v. McClear, 11 Nev. 39;
H. Wagman & Co. v. Schafer Motor Freight Service, 4
N.Y.S.2d 526, 529, 167 Misc. 681.
Common Jury
In practice. The ordinary kind of jury by which
issues of fact are generally tried, as distinguished
from a special jury, (q. v.).
Fair and Impartial Jury
See Fair and Impartial Jury.
Foreign Jury
A jury obtained from a county other than that
in which issue was joined.
Grand Jury
A jury of inquiry who are summoned and re-
turned by the sheriff to each session of the crim-
inal courts, and whose duty is to receive com-
plaints and accusations in criminal cases, hear the
evidence adduced on the part of the state, and find
bills of indictment in cases where they are satis-
fied a trial ought to be had. They are first sworn,
and instructed by the court.
This is called a "grand jury" because it comprises a
greater number of jurors than the ordinary trial jury or
"petit jury." At common law, a grand jury consisted of
not less than twelve nor more than twenty-three men, and
this is still the rule in many of the states, though in some
the number is otherwise fixed by statute; thus in Oregon
and Utah, the grand jury is composed of seven men; in
South Dakota, not less than six nor more than eight; in
Texas, twelve; in Idaho, sixteen; in Washington, twelve
to seventeen; in North Dakota, sixteen to twenty-three;
in California, nineteen; in New Mexico, twenty-one. See
Ex parte Bain, 121 U.S. 1, 7 S.Ct. 781, 30 L. Ed. 849; In re

lish v. State, 31 Fla. 340, 12 So. 689; Jones v. McClaughry,
169 Iowa, 281, 151 N.W. 210, 216.

A bilingual jury; a•jury of the half-tongue. See
De Medietat Linguae. Also a jury composed
partly of negroes and partly of white men.
Petit Jury
The ordinary jury of twelve men for the trial
of a civil or criminal action. So called to distin-
guish it from the grand jury.
A petit jury is a body of twelve men impaneled and
sworn in a district court, to try and determine, by a true
and unanimous verdict, any question or issue of fact, in
any civil or criminal action or proceeding, according to
law and the evidence as given them in the court. Gen.St.
Minn.1878, c. 71, § 1 (M.S.A. § 593.01).
Pix Jury
See Pix.
Special Jury
A jury ordered by the court, on the motion of
either party, in cases of unusual importance or
intricacy. Called, from the manner in which it
is constituted, a "struck jury." 3 Bl.Comm. 357.
A jury composed of persons above the rank of
ordinary freeholders; usually summoned to try
questions of greater importance than those usually
submitted to common juries. Brown.
Struck Jury

case; or a jury summoned and impaneled for the
trial of a case, and in this sense a petit jury as dis-
tinguished from a grand jury.

## JUS

Lat. In Roman law. Right; justice; law;
the whole body of law; also a right. The term is
used in two meanings:
1. "Jus" means "law," considered in the abstract; that
is, as distinguished from any specific enactment, the
science or department of learning, or quasi personified
factor in human history or conduct or social development,
which we call, in a general sense, "the law." Or it means
the law taken as a system, an aggregate, a whole ; "the
sum total of a number of individual laws taken together."
Or it may designate some one particular system or body of
particular laws; as in the phrases "jus civile," "jus gen-
tium," "jus prcetorium."
2. In a second sense, "jus" signifies "a right;" that is,
a power, privilege, faculty, or demand inherent in one per-
son and incident upon another; or a capacity residing in
one person of controlling, with the assent and assistance
of the state, the actions of another. This is its meaning in
the expressions "jus in rem," "jus accrescendi," "jus pos-
sessionis."
It is thus seen to possess the same ambiguity as the
words "droit," "recht," and "right," (which see.)
Within the meaning of the maxim that "ignorantia juris
non excusat" (ignorance of the law is no excuse), the word
"jus" is used to denote the general law or ordinary law of
the land, and not a private right. Churchill v. Bradley, 58
Vt. 403, 5 A. 189, 56 Am.Rep. 563; Cooper v. Fibbs, L.R.
2 H.L. 149; Freichnecht v. Meyer, 39 N.J.Eq. 561.
The continental jurists seek to avoid this ambiguity in
the use of the word "jus," by calling its former significa-
tion "objective," and the latter meaning "subjective."
Thus Mackeldey (Rom.Law, § 2) says : "The laws of the
first kind [compulsory or positive laws] form law [jus] in
its objective sense, [jus est norma agendi, law is a rule of
conduct.] The possibility resulting from law in this sense
to do or require another to do is law in its subjective
sense, [jus est facultas agendi, law is a license to act.]
The voluntary action of man in conformity with the pre-
cepts of law is called 'justice,' [justitia.J"
Some further meanings of the word are:
An action. Bract. fol. 3. Or, rather, those proceedings
in the Roman action which were conducted before the
praetor.
Power or authority. Sui juris, in one's own power;
independent. Inst. 1, 8, pr. ; Bract. fol. 3. Alieni juris,
under another's power. Inst. 1, 8, pr.
The profession (ars) or practice of .the law. Jus ponitur
pro ipsa arte. Bract. fol. 2b.
A court or judicial tribunal, (locus in quo redditur jus.)
Id. fol. 3.

## JUS ABSTINENDI

The right of renunciation;
the right of an heir, under the Roman law, to re-
nounce or decline the inheritance, as, for example,
where his acceptance, in consequence of the ne-
cessity of paying the debts, would make it a bur-
den to him. See Mackeld.Rom.Law, § 733.

## JUS ABUTENDI

The right to abuse. By this
phrase is understood the right to do exactly as one
likes with property, or having full dominion over
property. 3 Toullier, no. 86.

## JUS ACCRESCENDI

The right of survivorship.
In re Brogan's Estate, 165 Misc. 111, 300 N.Y.S.
447, 455. The right of the survivor or survivors
of two or more joint tenants to the tenancy or
estate, upon the death of one or more of the joint
tenants. In re Capria's Estate, 89 Misc. 101, 151
N.Y.S. 385, 386.
JUS ACCRESCENDI INTER MERCATORES,
PRO BENEFICIO COMMERCII, LOCUM NON
HABET. The right of survivorship has no place
between merchants, for the benefit of commerce.
Co.Litt. 182a; 2 Story, Eq.Jur. § 1207; ' Broom,
Max. 455. There is no survivorship in cases of
partnership, as there is in joint-tenancy. Story,
Partn. § 90.
JUS ACCRESCENDI PRZEFERTUR ONERIBUS.
The right of survivorship is preferred to encum-
brances. 185a. Hence no dower or cur-
tesy can be claimed out of a joint estate. 1 Steph.
Comm. 316.

## JUS ACCRESCENDI PRIEFERTUR ULTIMAE VOLUNTATI

The right of survivorship is pre-
ferred to the last will. Co.Litt. 185b. A devise of
one's share of a joint estate, by will, is no sever-
ance of the jointure; for no testament takes ef-
fect till after the death of the testator, and by such
death the right of the survivor (which accrued
at the original creation of the estate, and has
therefore a priority to the other) is already vest-
ed. 2 Bl.Comm. 186; 3 Steph.Comm. 316.

## JUS ACTUS

In Roman law. A rural servitude
giving to a person a passage for carriages, or for
cattle.

## JUS AD REM

A term of the civil law, meaning
"a right to a thing;" that is, a right exercisable by
one person over a particular article of property in
virtue of a contract or obligation incurred by an-
other person in respect to it, and which is en-
forceable only against or through such other
person. It is thus distinguished from jus in re,
which is a complete and absolute dominion over
a thing available against all persons.
The disposition of modern writers is to use the term "jus
ad rem" as descriptive of a right without possession, and
"jus in re" as descriptive of a right accompanied by pos-
session. Or, in a somewhat wider sense, the former
denotes an inchoate or incomplete right to a thing ; the
latter, a complete and perfect right to a thing. See The
Carlos F. Roses, 177 U.S. 655, 20 S.Ct. 803, 44 L.Ed. 929;
The Young Mechanic, 30 Fed.Cas. 873.
In canon law. A right to a thing. An inchoate
and imperfect right, such as is gained by nomina-
tion and institution; as distinguished from jus
in re, or complete and full right, such as is ac-
quired by corporal possession. 2 Bl.Comm. 312.

## JUS ZELIANUM

A body of laws drawn up by
Sextus IElius, and consisting of three parts, where-
in were explained, respectively: (1) The laws of

as applied to a state of war, defining in particular
the rights and duties of the belligerent powers
themselves, and of neutral nations.

## JUS BELLUM DICENDI

ing war.

## JUS CANONICUM

## JUS CIVILE

Civil law. The system of law pe-
culiar to one state or people. Inst. 1, 2, 1. Partic-
ularly, in Roman law, the civil law of the Roman
people, as distinguished from the jus gentium.
The term is also applied to the body of law called,
emphatically, the "civil law."
The jus civile and the jus gentium are distinguished in
this way. All people ruled by statutes and customs use a
law partly peculiar to themselves, partly common to all
men. The law each people has settled for itself is peculiar
to the state itself, and Is called "jus civile," as being
peculiar to that very state. The law, again, that natural
reason has settled among all men,—the law that is guarded
among all peoples quite alike,—is called the "jus gen-
tium," and all nations use it as if law. The Roman people,
therefore, use a law that is partly peculiar to itself, partly
common to all men. Hunter, Rom. Law, 38.
But this is not the only, or even the general, use of the
words. What the Roman jurists had chiefly in view, when
they spoke of "jus civile," was not local as opposed to
cosmopolitan law, but the old law of the city as contrasted
torium, jus honorarium.) Largely, no doubt, the jus gen-
tium corresponds with the jus prcetorium; but the cor-
respondence is not perfect. Id. 39.

## JUS CIVILE EST QUOD SIBI POPULUS CON- STITUIT

lishes for itself. Inst. 1, 2, 1; Jackson v. Jackson,
1 Johns., N.Y., 424, 426.

## JUS CIVITATUS

The right of citizenship; the
freedom of the city of Rome. It differs from jus
quiritium, which comprehended all the privileges
of a free native of Rome. The difference is much
the same as between "denization" and "naturaliza-
tion" with us. Wharton.

## JUS CLOACAE

sewerage or drainage. An easement consisting

## JUS DISPONENDI

The right of disposing.
An expression used either generally to signify the right
of alienation, as when we speak of depriving a married
woman of the jus disponendi over her separate estate, or
specially in the law relating to sales of goods, where it is
often a question whether the vendor of goods has the
intention of reserving to himself the jus disponendi; e.,
of preventing the ownership from passing to the pur-
chaser, notwithstanding that he (the vendor) has parted

## JUS FUTURUM

In the civil law. A future right;
an inchoate, incipient, or expectant right, not yet

It may be either "jus delatum," when the subsequent
acquisition or vesting of it depends merely on the will of
the person in whom it is to vest, or "jus nondum dela-
tum," when it depends on the future occurrence of other
circumstances or conditions. Mackeld.Rom.Law, § 191.

## JUS GENTIUM

The law of nations. That law
which natural reason has established among all
men is equally observed among all nations, and is
called the "law of nations," as being the law
which all nations use. Inst. 1, 2, 1; Dig. 1, 1, 9; 1
Bl.Comm. 43; 1 Kent, Comm. 7; Mackeld. Rom.
Law, § 125.
Although this phrase had a meaning in the Roman law
which may be rendered by our expression "law of
nations," it must not be understood as equivalent to what
we now call "international law," its scope being much
wider. It was originally a system of law, or more properly
equity, gathered by the early Roman lawyers and magis-
trates from the common ingredients in the customs of the
old Italian tribes,—those being the nations, gentes, whom
they had opportunities of observing,—to be used in cases
where the jus civile did not apply ; that is, in cases
between foreigners or between a Roman citizen and a for-
eigner. The principle upon which they proceeded was that
any rule of law which was common to all the nations they
knew of must be intrinsically consonant to right reason,
and therefore fundamentally valid and just. From this it
was an easy transition to the converse principle, viz., that
any rule which instinctively commended itself to their
sense of justice and reason must be a part of the jus gen-
tium. And so the latter term came eventually to be about
synonymous with "equity," (as the Romans understood it,)
or the system of praetorian law.
Modern jurists frequently employ the term "jus gentium
privatum" to denote private international law, or that sub-
ject which is otherwise styled the "conflict of laws;" and
"jus gentium publicum" for public international law, or
the system of rules governing the intercourse of nations
with each other as persons.

land regarded as Quiritarian property. See Gib-
bon, Rom.Emp. c. xvii; Mackeld.Rom.Law, § 43.

tude giving to a 'person the right to pass over an

## JUS LATH

In Roman law. The right of Latium

access to the freedom of Rome, and a participation in her
sacred rites. Butl.Hor.Jur. 41.
.TUS LATIUM. In Roman law. A rule of law ap-
plicable to magistrates in Latium.
It was either majus Latium or minus Latium,—the majus

Another author defines this privilege as one by
which exemption was given from all troublesome
offices. Brown, L.Dict.
In order that she should be able to take all the property
given her by will, she must have had this privilege con-
ferred upon her. Sohm, Inst.Rom.L. § 86. In the time of
Hadrian, a decree was made conferring upon ft mother, as
such, who, being an ingenua, had the jus trium liberorum,
or being a libertina, the jus quettuor liberorum, a civil law
right to succeed her intestate children; id. § 98.

## JUS NATURALE

The natural law, or law of na-
ture; law, or legal principles, supposed to be dis-
coverable by the light of nature or abstract rea-
soning, or to be taught by nature to all nations
and men alike; or law supposed to govern men
and peoples in a state of nature, i. e., in advance
of organized governments or enacted laws.
This concept originated with the philosophical jurists of
Rome, and was gradually extended until the phrase came
to denote a supposed basis or substratum common to all
systems of positive law, and hence to be found, in greater
or less purity, in the laws of all nations. And, conversely,
they held that if any rule or principle of law was observed
in common by all peoples with whose systems they were
acquainted, it must be a part of the jus naturale, or
derived from it. Thus the phrases "jus naturale" and "jus
gentium" came to be used interchangeably.

## JUS NATURALE EST QUOD APUD HOMINES EANDEM HABET POTENTIAM

Natural right
is that which has the same force among all man-
kind. 7 Coke, 12.

Mackeld. Rom. Law, § 124.
Also private ownership, or the right, title, or dominion
of a private owner, as distinguished from "jus publicum,"
which denotes public ownership, or the ownership of prop-
erty by the government, either as a matter of territorial
sovereignty or in trust for the benefit and advantage of

should sell, he must sell to the former seller.
Hunter. Rom. L., 503.

## JUS PROVINCIARUM

A franchise conferred
upon provincials much more limited than that
conferred upon the people of Italy.
It has been described as "equivalent to the jus italicum
minus the freedom from land taxation which the latter
right involved. In short, the provincials possessed no
status as Roman citizens; and even their capacity of
ownership in their own land was qualified by their tribu-
tary obligations to Rome. The civil incapacity of the
provincials had reference, however, merely to their exclu-
sion from the strictly legal rights sanctioned by the jus
civile." Morey, Rom.L. 55.

## JUS PUBLICUM

Public law, or the law relating
to the constitution and functions of government
and its officers and the administration of criminal
justice. Also public ownership, or the paramount
or sovereign territorial right or title of the state
or government. See Jus Privatum.
It implies a right in a sovereign or public capacity to be
exercised for the interest or benefit of the state or the
public, as distinguished from the exercise in a proprietary
capacity of a right of the sovereign or a right possessed
by an individual in common with the public. G. L. Web-
ster Co. v. Steelman, 172 Va. 342, 1 S.E.2d 305, 311.
Sovereign's right of jurisdiction and dominion for gov-
ernmental purposes over all lands and waters within its
territorial limits, including tidal waters and their bottoms,
is sometimes termed "jus publicum." Commonwealth v.
City of Newport News, 158 Va. 521, 164 S.E. 689, 696.
JUS PUBLICUM ET PRIVATUM QUOD EX NA-
TURALIBUS PR2ECEPTIS AUT GENTIUM AUT
CIVILIBUS EST COLLECTUM; ET QUOD IN
JURE SCRIPTO JUS APPELLATUR, ID IN
LEGE ANGLIZE RECTUM ESSE DICITUR. Co.
Litt. 185. Public and private law is that which is

or in states; and that which in the civil law is

tom, in contradistinction to such parts of the law

After stating that the Roman law was written and
unwritten just as it was among the Greeks, Justinian adds

consulte, enactments of emperors, edicts of magistrates,
and answers of jurisprudents." Sand.Inst.Just. 1, 2, 3.
See Jus Ex Non Scripto.

A right of way over land by

this right became subject to certain restrictions, yet when
the child had grown up, the father, in the exercise of his
domestic jurisdiction, might visit his son's misconduct,
both in private and public life, with such punishment as he
though fit, even banishment, slavery, or death. In the
early Empire these rights became relaxed, and they dis-
appeared in the Justinian law. Murihead, Roman Law, 28,
346, 417. See Patria Potestas.
JUSJURANDI FORMA VERBIS DIFFERT, RE

Hancock & C. R. Co. v. Stinson, 77 Fla. 333, 81
So. 512.
"The words 'just' and 'justly' do not always mean 'just'
and 'justly' in a moral sense, but they not unfrequently,
in their connection with other words in a sentence, bear a
very different signification. It is evident, however, that
the word 'just' in the statute [requiring an affidavit for an
attachment to state that plaintiff's claim is just] means
'just' in a moral sense; and from its isolation, being made
a separate subdivision of the section, it is intended to
mean 'morally just' in the most emphatic terms. The
claim must be morally just, as well as legally just, in
order to entitle a party to an attachment." Robinson v.
Burton, 5 Kan. 300.

## JUST BEYOND

el "just beyond" the basin means barely beyond,

It is said that this word in its Latin form (justitia) was
properly applicable only to the judges of common-law
courts, while the term "judex" designated the judges of
ecclesiastical and other courts. See Leg.Hen. I, §§ 24, 63;
Co. Litt. 71b.

prel. no. 5; Livingston Oil Corporation v. Henson,

Commutative justice is that which should govern con-
tracts. It consists in rendering to every man the exact
measure of his dues, without regard to his personal worth
or merits, i. e., placing all men on an equality. Distribu-
tive justice is that which should govern the distribution
of rewards and punishments. It assigns to each the
rewards which his personal merit or services deserve, or
the proper punishment for his crimes. It does not con-
sider all men as equally deserving or equally blameworthy,
but discriminates between them, observing a just propor-
tion and comparison. This distinction originated with
Aristotle. (Eth.Nic. V.) See Fonbl.Eq. 3; Toull.Droit
Civil Fr. tit. pre. no. 7.
In the most extensive sense of the word "justice" differs
little from "virtue;" for it includes within itself the
whole circle of virtues. Yet the common distinction
between them is that that which, considered positively and
in itself, is called "virtue," when considered relatively and
with respect to others has the name of "justice." But
"justice," being in itself a part of "virtue," is confined to
things simply good or evil, and consists in a man's taking
such a proportion of them as he ought. Bouvier.
"Equity" and "Justice" are substantially equivalent
terms, if not synonymous. In re Lessig's Estate, 6 N.Y.
S.2d 720, 721, 168 Misc. 889.
Under constitutional provision guaranteeing right to
obtain justice, the "justice" to be administered by courts
is not an abstract justice as conceived of by the judge but
justice according to law or, as it is phrased in the con-
stitution, "conformably to the laws". State ex rel. Depart-
ment of Agriculture v. McCarthy, 238 Wis. 258, 299 N.W.
58, 64.

ham.

## JUSTICE IN EYRE

"eire," e., a journey. Those justices who in an-
cient times were sent by commission into various

"justices in eyre."
They differed from justices in oyer and terminer, inas-
much as the latter were sent to one place, and for the
purpose of trying only a limited number of special causes;
whereas the justices in eyre were sent through the various
counties, with a more indefinite and general commission.
In some respects they resembled our present justices of
