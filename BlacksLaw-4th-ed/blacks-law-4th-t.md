## TABELLA

Lat. In Roman law. A tablet. Used

Tabelliones differed from notaries in many respects :
they had judicial jurisdiction in some cases, and from their
judgments there were no appeals. Notaries were then the
clerks or alders of the tabelliones; they received the agree-
ments of the parties, which they reduced to short notes;
and these contracts were not binding until they were writ-
ten in extenso, which was done by the tabelliones. Jacob
Law Dict. Tabellion.

inn, or house of entertainment. Cowell.

## TABULA IN NAUFRAGIO

Lat. A plank in

gagee, who took without notice of the second
mortgage, to acquire the first incumbrance, at-
tach it to his own, and thus squeeze out and get
satisfaction, before the second is admitted to the
fund. 1 Story, Eq. Jur. § 414; 2 Ves.Ch. 573. "It
may be fairly said that the doctrine survives only
in the unjust and much-criticised English rule of
tacking." Ames, Lect. Leg. Hist. 269. See Tack-
ing. The use of the expression is attributed to
Sir Matthew Hale. See 2 P. Wms. 491..

fested by the refraining from contradiction or
objection; inferred from the situation and cir-
cumstances, in the absence of express matter.

## TACIT ACCEPTANCE

In the civil law, a tacit
acceptance of an inheritance takes place when
some act is done by the heir which necessarily
supposes his intention to accept and which he
would have no right to do but in his capacity as
heir. Civ. Code La. art. 988.

## TACIT DEDICATION

Of property for public use
is dedication arising from silence or inactivity,
without express contract or agreement. Goree v.
Midstates Oil Corporation, 205 La. 988, 18 So.2d
:591, 596.

## TACIT HYPOTHECATION

In the civil law, a
species of lien or mortgage which is created by
operation of law without any express agreement
of the parties. Mackeld. Rom. Law, § 343. In
admiralty law, this term is sometimes applied to
a maritime lien, which is not, strictly speaking, an
hypothecation in the Roman sense of the term,
though it resembles it. See The Nestor, 1 Sumn.
73, 18 Fed.Cas. 9.

## TACIT LAW

A law which derives its authority
from the common consent of the people without
any legislative enactment. 1 Bouv. Inst. no. 120.

## TACIT MORTGAGE

In the law of Louisiana.
The law alone in certain cases gives to the credi-
tor a mortgage on the property of his debtor,
- without it being requisite that the parties should
stipulate it. This is called "legal mortgage." It
is called also "tacit mortgage," because it is es-
tablished by the law without the aid of any agree-
ment. Civ. Code La. art. 3311.

## TACIT RELOCATION

A doctrine borrowed from
the Roman law. It is a presumed renovation of
the contract from the period at which the former
expired, and is held to arise from implied consent
of parties, in consequence of their not having
signified their intention that agreement should
terminate at the period stipulated. Though the
original contract may have been for a longer
period than one year, the renewed agreement can
never be for more than one year, because verbal
contract of location can extend longer. Srygley
v. City of Nashville, 175 Tenn. 417, 135 S.W.2d
In Scotch law. The tacit or implied renewal
of a lease, inferred when the landlord, instead of
warning a tenant to remove at the stipulated ex-
piration of the lease, has allowed him to continue
without making a new agreement. Bell, "Reloca-
tion."

## TACIT TACK

In Scotch law. An implied tack
or lease; inferred from a tacksman's possessing
peaceably after his tack is expired. 1 Forb. Inst.
pt. 2, p. 153.

## TACITA QUIEDAM HABENTUR PRO EXPRES- SIS

8 Coke, 40. Things unexpressed are some-
times considered as expressed.

## TACITE

Lat. Silently; impliedly; tacitly.

## TACITURNITY

In Scotch law, laches in not
prosecuting a legal claim, or in acquiescing in an
adverse one. Mozley & Whitley.

## TACK

To annex some junior lien to a first
lien, thereby acquiring priority over an interme-
diate one. See Tacking.

## TACK

In Scotch law.. A term corresponding
to the English "lease," and denoting the same
species of contract.
Tack duty. Rent reserved upon a lease.

## TACKING

The uniting of securities given at
different times, so as to prevent any intermediate
purchaser from claiming a title to redeem or oth-
erwise discharge one lien, which is prior, without
redeeming or discharging the other liens also,
which are subsequent to his own title. 1 Story,
Eq. Jur. § 412. The term is particularly applied
to the action of a third mortgagee who, by buy-
ing the first lien and uniting it to his own, gets
priority over the second mortgagee.
The source and origin of the English doctrine is the case
of Marsh v. Lee, 2 Ventr. 337; 1 Ch.Cas. 162; 1 Wit & T.
L.C.Eq. 611, notes. This case and the doctrine founded
upon it has been the subject of severe criticism. Langd.
Eq.P1. 191. Lord Ch. J. Holt is said to have been one of
the first to benefit by the right of tacking. Holt v. Mill, 2
Vern. 279. This doctrine is inconsistent with laws which
require the recording of mortgages, and in the United
States, it does not exist to any extent. Brayee v. Bank, 14
Ohio 318; Dyer v. Graves, 37 Vt. 375; Parkist v. Alexan-
der, 1 Johns.Ch., N.Y., 399; Bisph.Eq. § 159.
The term is also used in a number of other connections,
as of possessions, disabilities, or items in accounts or other
dealings. In these several cases the purpose of the pro-.
posed tacking is to avoid the bar of a statute of limitations.
See Davis v. Coblens, 174 U.S. 719, 19 S. a. 832, 43 L. Ed.
1147; Knippenberg v. Morris, 80 Ind. 540; Eager v. Com.,
4 Mass. 182; Sharp v. Stephens' Committee, 21 Ky.L.Rep.
687, 52 S.W. 977; Graham v. Stanton, 177 Mass. 321, 58
N.E. 1023; Moore v. Blackman, 109 Wis. 528, 85 N.W. 429.
The term is applied especially to the process of making out
title to land by adverse possession, when the present occu-
pant and claimant has not been in possession for the full
statutory period, but adds or "tacks" to his own posses-
sion that of previous occupants under whom he claims.
See J. B. Streeter Co. v. Fredrickson, 11 N.D. 300, 91 N.W.
692; Frost v. Courtis, 172 Mass. 401, 52 N.E. 515; Murray
v. Pannaci, 67 N.J.Eq. 724, 57 A. 1132.

## TACKSMAN

In Scotch law. A tenant or lessee;
one to whom a tack is granted. 1 Forb. Inst. pt.
2,p. 153.

## TACTIS SACROSANCTIS

Lat. In old English
law. Touching the holy evangelists. Fleta, lib.
3,c. 16, § 21. "A bishop may swear visis evange-
liis, [looking at the Gospels,] and not tactis, and
it is good enough." Freem. 133.

## TACTO PER SE SANCTO EVANGELIO

Lat.
Having personally touched the holy Gospel. Cro.
Eliz. 105. The description of a corporal oath.

## TAIL

Limited; abridged; reduced; curtailed, as
a fee or estate in fee, to a certain order of suc-
cession, or to certain heirs.

## TAIL, ESTATE IN

An estate of inheritance,
which, instead of descending to heirs generally,
goes to the heirs of the donee's body, which means
his lawful issue, his children, and through them
to his grandchildren in a direct line, so long as
his posterity endures in a regular order and
course of descent, and upon the death of the first
owner without issue, the estate determines. 1
Washb. Real Prop. *72. Kolmer v. Miles, 270 Ill.
20, 110 N.E. 407, 408; Tantum v. Campbell, 83 N.J.
Eq. 361, 91 A. 120, 121; Harwell v. Harwell, 151
Tenn. 587, 271 S.W. 353, 355.
A freehold of inheritance, limited to a person and the
heirs of his body, general or special, male or female, and
is the creature of the statute de Donis. The estate, provid-
ed the entail be not barred, reverts to the donor or re-
versioner, if the donee die without leaving descendants
answering to the condition annexed to the estate upon its
creation, unless there be a limitation over to a third person
on default of such descendants, when it vests in such third
person or remainder-man. Wharton. In re Reeves, 10 Del.
Ch. 324, 92 A. 246, 247; 10 Del.Ch. 483, 94 A. 511, 513;
Conover v. Cade, 184 Ind. 604, 112 N.E. 7, 11; Gardner v.
Anderson, 114 Kan. 778, 227 P. 743, 748; Cox v. Fink, 200
Ky. 219, 254 S.W. 757, 758.
Several Tail
An entail severally to two; as if land is given
to two men and their wives, and to the heirs of
their bodies begotten; here the donees have a
joint estate for their two lives, and yet they have
a several inheritance, because the issue of the one
shall have his moiety, and the issue of the other
the other moiety. Cowell.
Tail after Possibility of Issue Extinct
A species of estate tail which arises where one
is tenant in special tail, and a person from whose
body the issue was to spring dies without issue,
Or, having left issue, that issue becomes extinct.
In either of these cases the surviving tenant in
special tail becomes "tenant in tail after possibility
of issue extinct." 2 Bl.Comm. 124.
Tail Female
When lands are given to a person and the fe-
male heirs of his or her body. The male heirs are
not capable of inheriting it.
Tail General
An estate in tail granted to one "and the heirs
eral" because, how often soever such donee in
tail be married, his issue in general by all and
every such marriage is, in successive order, capa-
ble of inheriting the estate tail per formam doni.
2 Bl.Comm. 113; Tantum v. Campbell, 83 N.J.Eq.
361, 91 A. 120, 122. This is where an estate is lim-
ited to a man and the heirs of his body, without
any restriction at all; or, according to some au-
thorities, with no other restriction than that in
relation to sex. Thus, tail male general is the
same thing as tail male; the word "general," in
such case, implying that there is no other restric-
tion upon the descent of the estate than that it
must go in the male line. So an estate in tail
female general is an estate in tail female. The
word "general," in the phrase, expresses a purely
negative idea, and may denote the absence of
any restriction, or the absence of some given re-
striction which is tacitly understood. Mozley &
Whitley.
Tail Male
When certain lands are given to a person and
the male heirs of his or her body. The female
heirs are not capable of inheriting it,
Tail Special
This denotes an estate in tail where the succes-
sion is restricted to certain heirs of the donee's
body, and does not go to all of them in general;
e. g., where lands and tenements are given to a
man and "the heirs of his body on Mary, his now
wife, to be begotten;" here no issue can inherit
but such special issue as is engendered between
those two, not such as the husband may have by
another wife, and therefore it is called "special
tail." 2 Bl.Comm. 113. It is defined by Cowell
as the limitation of lands and tenements to a
man and his wife and the heirs of their two
bodies. But the phrase need not be thus restrict-
ed. Tail special, in its largest sense, is where the
gift is restrained to certain heirs of the donor's
body, and does not go to all of them in general.
Mozley & Whitley.

## TAIL LIGHT

Red light on the rear of a motor
vehicle. Mahar v. Mackay, 55 Cal.App.2d 869,
132 13.2d 42, 47.

## TAILAGE

See Tallage,
TAILLE. Fr.
In old English law. The fee which is opposed to
fee-simple, because it is so minced or pared that
it is not in the owner's free power to dispose of
it, but it is, by the first giver, cut or divided from
all other, and tied to the issue of the donee,—in
short, an estate-tail. Wharton.
In old Franch law. A tax or assessment levied
by the king, or by any great lord, upon his sub-
jects, usually taking the form of an imposition
upon the owners of real estate. Brande. The
equivalent of the English tallage—the typical di-
rect tax in France of the Middle Ages, as tonlieu
was the generic term for an indirect tax. See
TAILORS TO THE TRADE. Those who cut,
make, and trim garments for merchant tailors
in different parts of the United States. Magid v.
Tannenbaum, 164 App.Div. 142, 149 N.Y.S. 445.

## TAILZIE

In Scotch law. An entail. A tailzied
fee is that which the owner, by exercising his in-
herent right of disposing of his property, settles
upon others than those to whom it would have
descended by law. 1 Forb.Inst. pt. 2, p. 101.

## TAINT

A conviction of felony, or the person so
convicted. Cowell.

## TAKE

To lay hold of; to gain or receive into
possession; to seize; to deprive one of the use or
possession of; to assume ownership. City of Dur-
ham v. Wright, 190 N.C. 568, 130 S.E. 161, 163.
Thus, constitutions generally provide that a man's prop-
erty shall not be taken for public uses without just com-
pensation. Evansville & C. R. Co. v. Dick, 9 Ind. 433; Gas
Products Co. v. Rankin, 63 Mont. 372, 207 P. 993, 998, 24
A.L.R. 294; Piper v. Ekern, 180 Wis. 586, 194 N.W. 159,
162, 34 A.L.R. 32. Property may be deemed "taken" with-
in the meaning of these constitutional provisions when it
Is totally destroyed or rendered valueless, Lund v; Salt
Lake County, 58 Utah 546, 200 P. 510, 513; or when it is
damaged by a public use in connection with an actual tak-
ing by the exercise of eminent domain, City of St. Louis
v. St. Louis, I. M. & S. Ry. Co., 272 Mo. 80, 197 S.W. 107,
111; or when there is interference with use of property to
owner's prejudice, with resulting diminution in value
thereof, Webster County v. Lutz, 234 Ky. 618, 28 S.W.2d
966, 967. But acquisition of title or total destruction of
value is not essential to "taking," for which compensa-
tion must be made. Cheves v. Whitehead, D.C.Ga., 1 F.
Supp. 321, 324.
The word take has many shades of meaning, pre-
cise meaning which it is to bear in any case de-
pending on the subject with respect to which it is
used. Kennedy v. New York Life Ins. Co., 178
Misc. 258, 172 So. 743, 745.
In the law of larceny, to obtain or assume pos-
session of a chattel unlawfully, and without the
owner's consent; to appropriate things to one's
own use with felonious intent. Thus, an actual
taking is essential to constitute larceny. 4 Bl.
Comm. 430. A "taking" occurs when a person
with a preconceived design to appropriate prop-
erty to his own use obtains possession of it by
means of fraud or trickery. People v. Edwards,
Cal.App. 102, 236 P. 944, 948.
In this connection, "take" is not synonymous with "ob-
tain," which embraces many other ways of acquiring prop-
erty. Allen v. State, 97 Tex.Cr.R. 467, 262 S. W. 502, 503.
Nor is "take" necessarily synonymous with "steal." Hunt
v. State, 89 Tex.Cr.R. 89, 229 S.W. 869, 871; Louisville &
N. R. Co. v. Malone, 200 Ala. 380, 76 So., 296, 297. But the
phrase "take by stealth" may have the same meaning as
"steal." Roach v. State, 23 Okl.Cr. 280, 214 P. 563, 564.
To seize or apprehend a person; to arrest the
body of a person by virtue of lawful process.
Thus, a capias commands the officer to take the
body of the defendant. Corn. v. Hall, 9 Gray,
Mass., 267, 69 Am.Dec. 285.
To acquire the title to an estate; to receive or
be entitled to an estate in lands from another
person by virtue of some species of title. Thus
one is said to "take by purchase," "take by de-
scent," "take a life-interest under the devise," etc.
In re Bock, 125 Misc. 653, 211 N.Y.S. 621. 622.
To receive the verdict of a jury; to superintend
the delivery of a verdict; to hold a court. The
commission of assize in England empowers the
judges to take the assizes; that is, according to
its ancient meaning, to take the verdict of a pe-
culiar species of jury called an "assize;" but, in
its present meaning, "to hold the assizes." 3 Bl.
Comm. 59, 185. To choose; e. g., ad capiendas
assisas, to choose a jury.
To procure or to obtain (an appeal). Nessans
v. Colomes, 136 La. 1051, 68 So. 122; Cochran v.
State, 206 Ala. 74, 89 So. 278.
See, also, Taking.

## TAKE AWAY

This term in a statute punishing
every person who shall take away any female un-
der 18 from her father for the purpose of prosti-
tution requires only that such person procure or
cause her to go away by some persuasion, entice-
ment, or inducement offered, exercised, or held out
to the girl, or by furnishing her the means or
money with which to go away. State v. Corrigan,
262 Mo. 195, 171 S.W. 51, 54.

## TAKE BACK

To revoke; to retract; as, to take
back one's promise. Dimock State Bank v. Boeh-
nen, 46 S.D. 50, 190 N.W. 485.

## TAKE BY STEALTH

To steal; feloniously to
take and carry away the personal goods of an-
other; to take without right, secretly, and without
leave or consent of the owner. Roach v. State, 23
Okl.Cr. 280, 214 P. 563, 564.

## TAKE CARE OF

after (a person). Ballenger v. Ballenger, 208 Ala.
147, 94 So. 127. To pay (a debt). Scranton Mer-
cantile Co. v. E. Schneider & Co., 163 Ark. 536,
260 S.W. 426, 427. To attend to. Southern Surety
Co. v. Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co., 215 Iowa, 525, 245
N.W. 864, 868.

## TAKE EFFECT

To become operative or execut-
ed. Miller v. Oliver, 54 Cal.App. 495, 202 P. 168,
171. To be in force, or go into operation. Mowery
v. Washington Nat. Ins. Co., 289 Ill.App. 443, 7
N.E.2d 334, 335.

## TAKE OVER

of;-not necessarily involving the transfer of ab-
solute title. New York Trust Co. v. Farmers'
Irr. Dist., C.C.A.Neb., 280 F. 785, 795. See, how-
ever, Knight v. First Nat. Bank, C.C.A.Ky., 281 F.
968, 972.

## TAKE UP

To pay or discharge (a note). Ash-
ville Say. Bank v. Lee, 214 Ala. 501, 108 So. 335,
337; McKenzie v. Smith, 18 Ga.App. 626, 89 S.E.
1097, 1098; Dilenbeck v. Herrold, 183 Iowa, 264,
164 N.W. 869, 870. Also, sometimes, to purchase
a note. Dilenbeck v. Herrold, supra. To retire
(a negotiable instrument) ; to discharge one's li-
ability on it;-said particularly of an indorser
or acceptor.
A party to a negotiable instrument, particularly an in-
dorser or acceptor, is said to "take up" the paper, or to
"retire" it, when he pays its amount, or substitutes other
security for it, and receives it again into his own hands.
See Hartzell v. McClurg, 54 Neb. 316, 74 N.W. 626; Mc-
Kenzie v. Smith, 18 Ga.App. 626, 89 S.E. 1097, 1098.

## TAKER

One who takes or acquires; particular-
ly, one who takes an estate by devise. When an
estate is granted subject to a remainder or execu

is called the "first taker."
TAKING. In criminal law and torts. The act
of laying hold upon an article, with or without
removing the same. It implies a transfer of pos-
session, dominion, or control. See Take.
Under various statutes relating to sexual offenses, such
as the abduction of a girl under the age of 18 years for
the purpose of carnal intercourse, to constitute a "taking"
no force, actual or constructive, need be exercised. State
v. Lauzer, 152 Minn. 279, 188 N.W. 558, 559. The "taking"
may be effected by persuasion, enticement, or inducement.
State v. Richards, 88 Wash. 160, 152 P. 720. And it is not,
necessary that the girl be taken from the control or
against the will of those having lawful authority over her.
State v. Lauzer, 152 Minn. 279, 188 N.W. 558. But the
state must prove conduct by defendant indicating a con.
trol, complete or partial, of her person, having sexual in-
tercourse as its object. State v. Clough, Del.Gen.Sess., 134
A. 172. 173.

## TALC

ed silicate of magnesia. U. S. v. R. C. Boeckel &
Co., C.C.A.Mass., 221 F. 885, 886.

## TALE

a sufficient number of unexceptionable jurors does
not appear at the trial, either party may pray a
"tales," as it is termed; that is, a supply of such
men as are summoned on the first panel in order
to make up the deficiency. Brown. See State
v. McCrystol, 43 La.Ann. 907, 9 So. 922; Railroad
Co. v. Mask, 64 Miss. 738, 2 So. 360.
A list of such jurymen as were of the tales,

TALIS INTERPRETATIO SEMPER FIENDA
EST, UT EVITETUR ABSURDUM ET INCON-
VENIENS, ET NE JUDICIUM SIT ILLUSORIUM.
1 Coke, 52. Interpretation is always to be made
in such a manner that what is absurd and incon-
venient may be avoided, and the judgment be not
illusory [or nugatory].
TALIS NON EST EADEM; NAM NULLUM SIM-
ILE EST IDEM, 4 Coke, 18. What is like is not
the same; for nothing similar is the same.
TALIS RES, VEL TALE RECTUM, QUIE VEL
QUOD NON EST IN HOMINE ADTUNC SU-
PERSTITE SED TANTUMMODO EST ET CON-
SISTIT IN CONSIDERATIONE ET INTELLI-
GENTIA LEGIS, ET QUOD ALII DIXERUNT
TALEM REM VEL TALE RECTUM FORE IN
NUBIBUS. Such a thing or such a right as is not
vested in a person then living, but merely exists
in the consideration and contemplation of law [is
said to be in abeyance,] and others have said that
such a thing or such a right is in the clouds. Co.
Litt. 342.

## TALITER PROCESSUM EST

So it has pro-
ceeded. Words formerly used in pleading, by
which a defendant, in justifying his conduct by
the process of an inferior court, alleged the pro-
ceedings in such inferior court. Steph.P1. 5th ed.
p. 369. Upon pleading the judgment of an inferior
court, the proceedings preliminary to such judg-
ment, and on which the same was founded, must,
to some extent, appear in the pleading, but the
rule is that they may be alleged with a general
allegation that "such proceedings were had," in-
stead of a detailed account of the proceedings
themselves, and this general allegation is called
the "taliter processum est." A like concise mode
of stating former proceedings in a suit is adopted
at the present day in chancery proceedings upon
petitions and in actions in the nature of bills of
revivor and supplement. Brown.
TALLAGE, or TAILAGE. A piece cut out of the
whole. Cowell. Used metaphorically for a share
of a man's substance paid by way of tribute, toll,

was abolished by St. 23 Geo. III. c. 82, and the
old tallies were ordered to be destroyed by St
4 & 5 Wm. IV. c. 15. Wharton. By the custom
of London, sealed tallies were effectual as a deed.

straits, gulfs, estuaries and other arms of the sea
and also applies to boundary lakes and landlocked
seas whenever there is a deep water sailing chan-
nel therein. State of Louisiana v. State of Mis-

property to support the government, and is a
payment exacted by legislative authority. In re
Mytinger, D.C.Tex., 31 F.Supp. 977, 978, 979. An-

cise, subsidy, aid, supply, or other name. Story,
Const. § 950. And in its essential characteristics
is not a debt. City of Newark v. Jos. Hollander,
Inc., 136 N.J.Eq. 539, 42 A.2d 872, 875.
Synonyms
In a broad sense, taxes undoubtedly include as-
sessments, and the right to impose assessments
has its foundation in the taxing power of the
government; and yet, in practice and as gener-
ally understood, there is a broad distinction be-
tween the two terms. "Taxes," as the term is
generally used, are public burdens imposed gen-
erally upon the inhabitants of the whole state, or
upon some civil division thereof, for governmen-
tal purposes, without reference to peculiar benefits
to particular individuals or property. "Assess-
ments" have reference to impositions for im-
provements which are specially beneficial to par-
ticular individuals or property, and which are
imposed in proportion to the particular benefits
supposed to be conferred. They are justified
only because the improvements confer special ben-
efits, and are just' only when they are divided in
proportion to such benefits. Roosevelt Hospital v.
New York, 84 N.Y. 112. Flansburg v. Shumway,
117 Neb. 125, 219 N.W. 956, 958. As distinguished
from other kinds of taxation, "assessments" are
those special and local impositions upon property
in the- immediate vicinity of municipal improve-
ments which are necessary to pay for the improve-
ment, and are laid with reference to the special
benefit which the property is supposed to have
derived therefrom. Hale v. Kenosha, 29 Wis.
599; Ridenour v. Saffin, 1 Handy (Ohio) 464;
King v. Portland, 2 Or. 146; Witherow v. Board
of Drainage Com'rs of Powder Springs Creek
Drainage Dist. No. 2, 155 Ga. 476, 117 S.E. 329,
Taxes differ from subsidies, in being certain
and orderly, and from forced contributions, etc.,
in that they are levied by authority of law, and
by some rule of proportion which is intended to
insure uniformity of contribution, and a just ap-
portionment of the burdens of government. Cool-
ey, Tax'n, 2.
To assess or determine; to liquidate, adjust, or
settle. Spoken particularly of taxing costs (q. v.).
General
Ad valorem tax. See Ad Valorem.
Capitation tax. See that title.
Collateral inheritance tax. See Collateral Inher-
itance.
Direct tax. One which Is demanded from the
very persons who, it is intended or desired, should
pay it. Indirect taxes are those which are de-
manded from one person, in the expectation and
intention that he shall indemnify himself at the
expense of another. Mill, Pol. Econ. Taxes are
divided into "direct," under which designation
would be included those which are assessed upon
the property, person, business, income, etc., of
those who are to pay them, and "indirect," or
those which are levied on commodities before they
reach the consumer, and are paid by those upon
whom they ultimately fall, not as taxes, but as
part of the market price of the commodity. Cool-
ey, Tax'n, 6.
Historical evidence shows that personal property, con-
tracts, occupations, and the like, have never been regarded
as the subjects of direct tax. The phrase is understood to
be limited to taxes on land and its appurtenances, and on
polls. Veazie Bank v. Fenno, 8 Wall. 533, 19 L.Ed. 482 ;
Railroad Co. v. Morrow, 87 Tenn. 406, 11 S.W. 348, 2 L.R.
A. 853; People v. Knight, 174 N.Y. 475, 67 N.E. 65, 63
L.R.A. 87.
Estate tax. A tax upon the right to transfer,
while a succession or legacy tax is a tax upon
the right to receive. Hazard v. Bliss, 43 R.I. 431,
113 A. 469, 471, 23 A.L.R. 826; Frick v. Lewellyn,
D.C:Pa., 298 F. 803, 810; In re Hamlin, 226 N.Y.
407, 124 N.E. 4, 6, 7 A.L.R. 701; In re Sherman's
Estate, 179 App.Div. 497, 166 N.Y.S. 19, 23.
Excise and tax distinguished. See Excise.
Floor tax. A tax on all the distilled spirits "on
the floor" of a warehouse, i. e., in the warehouse.
Greenbrier Distillery Co. v. U. S., D.C.Ky., 288 F.
893, 895.
Franchise tax. See Franchise.
Income tax. See Income.
Indirect taxes are those demanded in the first
instance from one person in the expectation and
intention that he shall indemnify himself at the
expense of another. "Ordinarily all taxes paid
primarily by persons who can shift the burden
upon some one else, or who are under no legal
compulsion to pay them, are considered indirect
taxes." Pollock v. Farmers' L. & T. Co., 15 S.Ct.
673, 157 U.S. 429, 39 L.Ed. 759; Thomasson v.
State, 15 Ind. 451; Foster & Creighton Co. v.
Graham, 154 Tenn. 412, 285 S.W. 570, 572, 47 A.L.R.
Inheritance tax. See Inheritance.
Land tax. See Land Tax.
License tax. See License Fee or Tax.
Local taxes. Those assessments which are lim-
ited to certain districts, as poor-rates, parochial
taxes, county rates, municipal taxes, etc.
Occupation tax. See Occupation.
Parliamentary taxes. Such taxes as are im-
posed directly by act of parliament, i. e., by the
legislature itself, as distinguished from those
which are imposed by private individuals or bodies
under the authority of an act of parliament.
Thus, a sewers rate, not being imposed directly
by act of parliament, but by certain persons
termed "commissioners of sewers," is not a par-
liamentary tax; whereas the income tax, which
is directly imposed, and the amount also fixed, by
act of parliament, is a parliamentary tax. Brown.
Personal tax. This term may mean either a
tax imposed on the person without reference to
property, as a capitation or poll tax, or a tax im-
posed on personal property, as distinguished from
one laid on real property. See Jack v. Walker,
C.C.Ohio, 79 F. 138, 141; Potter v. Ross, 23 N.J.L.
Poll tax. See that title.
Proportional taxes. Taxes are "proportional"
when the proportion paid by each taxpayer bears
the same ratio to the amount to be raised that the
value of his property bears to the total taxable
value, and in the case of a special tax when that
is apportioned according to the benefits received.

Buffalo, 46 N.Y. 509.

or kind, without regard to its value; opposed to
ad valorem tax.
Succession tax. See Succession.
Surtax. An additional tax imposed upon cer-
tain kinds of income, such as dividends from cor-
porate stock, royalties, interest from money, notes,
credits, bonds and other securities. A surtax is
sometimes imposed on incomes exceeding a speci-
fied amount.

of land at a tax sale thereof, given by the officer
making the sale, and which is evidence of the
holder's right to receive a deed of the land if it

closed for non-payment, by judgment of a court or
sale of the land.

Tax-title. The title by which one holds land
which he purchased at a tax sale. That species of

evidenced by the deed executed to the tax purchas-
er, or his assignee, by the proper officer.

## TAXATION

The process of taxing or imposing
a tax. In practice. Adjustment. Fixing the
amount; e. g. Taxation of costs. 3 Chitty, Gen.
Pr. 602. See Tax.
The differences between taxation and taking property in
right of eminent domain are that taxation exacts money
or services from individuals, as and for their respective
shares of contribution to any public burden; while private
property taken for public use, by right of eminent domain,
is taken, not as the owner's share of contribution to a pub-
lic burden, but as so much beyond his share, and for which
compensation must be made. Moreover, taxation operates
upon a community, or upon a class of persons in a com-
munity, and by some rule of apportionment; while emi-
nent domain operates upon an individual, and without
reference to the amount or value exacted from any other
individual, or class of individuals. People v. Brooklyn,
4 N.Y. 419, 55 Am. Dec. 266.

A "taxicab" differs from a jitney bus, street car, or
omnibus as a carrier in that it does not follow a well-
defined route prescribed by ordinance, but is vehicle sub-
ject to contract by person desiring special trip from one

that will may be revoked by tearing, any act of
tearing of paper on which will is written, however
slight, constitutes an act of "tearing," if done with

old English law to describe ancient documents or
written evidence of things past. Blount.

## TELEPHONE

In a general sense, any instru-
ment or apparatus which transmits sound beyond
the limits of ordinary audibility. But, since the
recent discoveries in telephony, the name is techni-
cally and primarily restricted to an instrument or
device which transmits sound by means of elec-
tricity and wires similar to telegraphic wires. In
a secondary sense, however, being the sense in
which it is most commonly understood, the word
"telephone" constitutes a generic term, having
reference generally to the art of telephony as an
institution, but more particularly to the appara-
tus, as an entirety, ordinarily used in the transmis-
sion, as well as in the reception, of telephonic
messages. Hockett v. State, 105 Ind. 261, 5 N.E.
178, 55 Am.Rep. 201; State Public Utilities Com-

## TELEVISION

Seeing at a distance by electrical

duced by projecting upon a screen with the aid
of light rays images recorded upon a film in such
rapid and changing succession of exposures as to
give the optical effect of a continuous picture of
the objects even when in motion. The former di-
rectly employs natural phenomena; the latter,
mechanics. A notable objective difference is that
a motion picture may be re-exhibited as often as
desired for the life of the film but a television ex-
hibition once seen is gone forever so far as as-
sembly of the electronic waves upon which the
images are carried are concerned. Philadelphia.
Retail Liquor Dealers Ass'n v. Pennsylvania Liq-
uor Control Bd., 360 Pa. 269, 62 A.2d 53, 55, 4

TENANCY.
The Estate of a Tenant
The estate of a tenant, as in the expressions
"joint tenancy," "tenancy in common."
The Term or Interest of a Tenant
The term or interest of a tenant for years or
at will. Sweet; Stone v. City of Los Angeles, 114
Cal.App. 192, 299 P. 838, 841.
It implies a right of possession in tenant exclusive even
of landlord. Cleveland v. Milner, 141 Tex. 120, 170 S.W.2d
472, 475.
General Tenancy
A tenancy which is not fixed and made certain
in point of duration by the agreement of the par-
ties. Brown v. Bragg, 22 Ind. 122.
Joint Tenancy
An estate in fee-simple, fee-tail, for life, for
years, or at will, arising by purchase or grant to
two or more persons. Joint tenants have one and
the same interest, accruing by one and the same
conveyance, commencing at one and the same
time, and held by one and the same undivided
possession. The grand incident of joint tenancy
is survivorship, by which the entire tenancy on the
decease of any joint tenant remains to the surviv-
ors, and at length to the last survivor. Pub.St.
Mass.1882, p. 1292; Simons v. McLain, 51 Kan. 153,
32 P. 919; Thornburg v. Wiggins, 135 Ind. 178, 34
N.E. 999, 22 L.R.A. 42, 41 Am.St.Rep. 422; Van
851; In re Huggins' Estate, 96 N.J.Eq. 275, 125
A. 27, 30. See, also, Tenancy by the Entirety, in-
fra.
Several Tenancy
A tenancy which is separate, and not held joint-
ly with another person.
Tenancy by the Entirety
Is created by a conveyance to husband and wife,
whereupon each becomes seized and possessed of
the entire estate and after the death of one the sur-
vivor takes the whole. Safe Deposit & Trust Co.
v. Tait, D.C.Md., 295 F. 429, 431; Dutton v. Buck-
ley, 116 Or. 661, 242 P. 626, 627; Settle v. Settle,
8 F.2d 911, 912, 56 App.D.C. 50, 43 A.L.R. 1079;
Raptes v. Cheros, 259 Mass. 37, 155 N.E. 787;
Gasner v. Pierce, 286 Pa. 529, 134 A. 494, 495;
Smith v. Russell, 172 App.Div. 793, 159 N.Y.S. 169,
170. And is available only to husband and wife.
Fairclaw v. Forrest, 76 U.S.App.D.C. 197, 130 F.2d
829, 832, 833, 143 A.L.R. 1154. It is essentially a
"joint tenancy," modified by the common-law the-
ory that husband and wife are one person, and sur-
vivorship is the predominant and distinguishing
feature of each. United States v. Jacobs, Ill. &
N. Y., 59 S.Ct. 551, 555, 306 U.S. 363, 83 L.Ed. 763.
The grand characteristic which distinguishes it from a
joint tenancy is that it can be terminated only by joint
action of husband and wife during their lives, while "joint
tenancy" may be terminated by one tenant's conveyance
of his interest. Milan v. Boucher, 285 Mass. 590, 189 N.E.
576, 578. In re Cotter's Will, 287 N.Y.S. 670, 673, 159 Misc.
Tenancy in Common
Where property is held by several and distinct
titles by unity of possession, neither knowing his
own severally, and therefore they all occupy
promiscuously. Fullerton v. Storthz Bros. Inv.
Co., 190 Ark. 198, 77 S.W.2d 966, 968. The holding
of an estate in land by different persons under
different titles, but there must be unity' of pos-
session and each must have right to occupy the
whole in common with his cotenants. Fry v.
Dewees, 151 Kan. 488, 99 P.2d 844, 847.
Although "tenancy in common" is generally used with
reference to real property, a tenancy in common may ex-
ist in personalty as well. Haster v. Blair, 41 Cal.App.2d
896, 107 P.2d 933, 934. See, also, Tenant (Tenant in Com-
mon).

or possesses lands or tenements by any kind of
right or title, whether in fee, for life, for years,
at will, or otherwise. Cowell; Young v. Home
Telephone Co., Mo.App., 201 S.W. 635, 636; Kav-
anaugh v. Cohoes Power & Light Corporation, 114
Misc. 590, 187 N.Y.S. 216, 230.
In a more restricted sense, one who holds lands
of another; one who has the temporary use and
occupation of real property owned by another per-
son, (called the "landlord,") the duration and
terms of his tenancy being usually fixed by an
instrument called a "lease." Becker v. Becker,
13 App.Div. 342, 43 N.Y.S. 17; Bowe v. Hunking,
135 Mass. 383, 46 Am.Rep. 471; Clift v. White, 12
N.Y. 527; Lightbody v. Truelsen, 39 Minn. 310, 40
N.W. 67; Williams v. Treece, 184 Mo.App. 135, 168
S.W. 209, 211; Minneapolis Iron Store Co. v. Bran-
urn, 36 N.D. 355, 162 N.W. 543, 545, L.R.A.1917E,
298. One who occupies another's land or prem-
ises in subordination to such other's title and
with his assent, express or implied. In re Wil-
son's Estate, 349 Pa. 646, 37 A.2d 709, 710. One
renting land and paying for it either in money or
part of crop or equivalent. Wilcox & Co. v. Dein-
es, 119 Neb. 692, 230 N.W. 682, 684.
Strictly speaking, a "tenant" is a person who
holds land; but the term is also applied by anal-
ogy to personalty. Thus, we speak of a person
being tenant for life, or tenant in common, of
stock. Sweet.
Feudal Law
One who holds of another (called "lord" or "su-
perior") by some service; as fealty or rent.
Tenant at Will
One who holds possession of premises by per-
mission of owner or landlord, but without fixed
term. Wiedemann v. Brown, 190 Minn. 33, 250
N.W. 724; where lands or tenements are let by
one man to another, to have and to hold to him
at the will of the lessor, by force of which lease
the lessee is in possession. In this case the lessee
is called "tenant at will," because he hath no cer-
tain nor sure estate, for the lessor may put him
out at what time it pleaseth him. Litt. § 68;
Sweet. Post v. Post, 14 Barb. (N.Y.) 258; Spald-
ing v. Hall, 6 D.C. 125; Freedman v. Gordon, 220

He has no estate nor title but only naked possession
without right and wrongfully, and stands in no privity to
landlord and is not entitled to notice to quit, and is a bare
licensee to whom landlord owes merely duty not wantonly
nor willfully to injure him. Margosian v. Markarian, 288
Mass. 197, 192 N.E. 612, 613; Welch v. Rice, 61 Wyo. 511,
159 P.2d 502, 506, 509.

Tenant by the manner. One who has a less es-
tate than a fee in land which remains in the re-
versioner. He is so called because in avowries

tion to the veray tenant, who is called simply
"tenant." Ham. N.P. 393.
Tenant for life. One who holds lands or tene-
ments for the term of his own life, or for that of

was seised at any time during the coverture, to
hold to herself for life, as her dower. Co.Litt. 30;
2 Bl.Comm. 129; Combs v. Young, 4 Yerg. (Tenn.)
225, 26 Am.Dec. 225.
Tenant in fee-simple (or tenant in fee). He who

Bl.Comm. 179.
Tenant in tail. One who holds an estate in fee-
tail, that is, an estate which, by the instrument
creating it, is limited to some particular heirs,
exclusive of others; as to the heirs of his body
or to the heirs, male or female, of his body.
Tenant in tail ex provisione viri. Where an
owner of lands, upon or previously to marrying.
a wife, settled lands upon himself and his wife,
and the heirs of their two bodies begotten, and
then died, the wife, as survivor, became tenant in
tail of the husband's lands, in consequence of the
husband's provision, (ex provisione viri.) Orig-
inally, she could bar the estate-tail like any other
tenant in tail; but the husband's intention having
been merely to provide for her during her widow-
hood, and not to enable her to bar his children
of their inheritance, she was early restrained from
so doing, by the statute 32 Hen. VII. c. 36. Brown.
Tenant of the demesne. One who is tenant of
a mesne lord; as, where A. is tenant of B., and C.
of A., B. is the lord, A. the mesne lord, and C.
tenant of the demesne. Ham. N. P. 392, 393.
Tenant paravaile. The under-tenant of land;
that is, the tenant of a tenant; one who held of a
mesne lord.
Tenant to the prcipe. Before the English
fines and recoveries act, if land was conveyed to
a person for life with remainder to another in tail,
the tenant in tail in remainder was unable to bar
the entail without the concurrence of the tenant
for life, because a common recovery could only
be suffered by the person seised of the land. In
in barring the entail, he usually conveyed his life-
estate to some other person, in order that the prce-
cipe in the recovery might be issued against the
latter, who was therefore called the "tenant to
the prcecipe." Williams, Seis. 169; Sweet.
Tenants by the verge. The "same nature as
tenants by copy of court roll, [i. e., copyholders.]
But the reason why they be called 'tenants by the
verge' is for that, when they will surrender their
tenements into the hands of their lord to the use
of another, they shall have a little rod (by the cus-
tome) in their hand, the which they shall deliver
to the steward or to the bailife, * * * and
the steward or bailife, according to the custome,
shall deliver to him that taketh the land the same
rod, or another rod, in the name of seisin; and
for this cause they are called 'tenants by the
verge,' but they have no other evidence [title-deed]
but by copy of court roll." Litt. § 78; Co.Litt. 61a.

## TENANT-RIGHT

A kind of customary estate
in the north of England, falling under the general
class of copyhold, but distinguished from copyhold
by many of its incidents.
The so-called tenant-right of renewal is the ex-
pectation of a lessee that his lease will be renewed,
in cases where it is an estaklished practice to re-
new leases from time to time, as in the case of
leases from the crown, from ecclesiastical corpo-
rations, or other collegiate bodies. Strictly speak-
ing, there can be no right of renewal against the
lessor without an express compact by him to that
effect, though the existence of the custom often
influences the price in sales.
The Ulster tenant-right may be described as a
right on the tenant's part to sell his holding to
the highest bidder, subject to the existing or a rea-
sonable increase of rent from time to time, as cir-
cumstances may require, with a reasonable veto
reserved to the landlord in respect of the incom-
ing tenant's character and solvency. Mozley &
Whitley.

## TENANT'S FIXTURES

This phrase signifies
things which are fixed to the freehold of the de-
mised premises, but which the tenant may detach
and take away, provided he does so in season.
Wall v. Hinds, 4 Gray (Mass.) 256, 270, 64 Am.
Dec. 64.

## TENANTABLE REPAIR

Such a repair as will
render a house fit for present habitation.

## TENCON

L. Fr. A dispute; a quarrel. Kel-
ham.

## TEND

To have a leaning; serve, contribute,
or conduce in some degree or way, or have a more
or less direct bearing or effect; to be directed as
to any end, object, or purpose; to have a tend-
ency, conscious or unconscious, to any end, object
or purpose. Rogers v. State, 122 Tex.Cr.R. 331, 54
S.W.2d 1010, 1012.
In old English law. To tender or offer. Cowell.

## TENDER

An offer of money; the act by which
claim or demand against him the amount of mon-
ey which he considers and admits to be due, in
satisfaction of such claim or demand, without any
stipulation or condition. Kastens v. Ruland, 94 N.
J.Eq. 451, 120 A. 21, 22; Mondello v. Hanover
Trust Co., 252 Mass. 563, 148 N.E. 136, 137; Woot-
on v. Dahlquist, 42 Idaho, 121, 244 P. 407, 409; Mc-
Call Co. v. Hobbs-Henderson Co., 138 S.C. 435, 136
S.E. 762, 763.
The offer of performance, not performance itself, and,
when unjustifiably refused, places other party in default
and permits party making tender to exercise remedies for
breach of contract. Walker v. Houston, 215 Cal. 742,
12 P.2d 952, 953, 87 A.L.R. 937.
The actual proffer of money, as distinguished from mere
proposal or proposition to proffer it. Caplan v. Shaw, W.
Va., 30 S.E.2d 132, 140. Hence mere written proposal to
pay money, without offer of cash, is not "tender." Ward-
law v. Woodruff, 175 Ga. 515, 165 S.E. 557, 560.
"Tender," though usually used in connection
with an offer to pay money, is properly used in
connection with offer of property other than
money. Maxwell Implement Co. v. Fitzgerald, 85
Ind.App. 206, 146 N.E. 883, 885; Central Flour
Mills Co. v. Gateway Milling Co., Mo.App., 213 S.
W. 131, 134; In re Katzowitz, 214 App.Div. 429, 212
N.Y.S. 336, 338; Harrison v. Beals, 111 Or. 563,
222 P. 728, 731; Jose v. Aufderheide, 222 Mo.App.
524, 293 S.W. 476, 479.
Tender, in pleading, is a plea by defendant that
he has been always ready to pay the debt demand-
ed, and before the commencement of the action
tendered it to the plaintiff, and now brings it into
court ready to be paid to him, etc. Brown.
Legal tender is that kind of coin, money, or cir-
culating medium which the law compels a creditor
to accept in payment of his debt, when tendered
by the debtor in the right amount.
Tender of Amends
An offer by a person who has been guilty of any
wrong or breach of contract to pay a sum of
money by way of amends. If a defendant in an
action make tender of amends, and the plaintiff
decline to accept it, the defendant may pay the
money into court, and plead the payment into
court as a satisfaction of the plaintiff's claim.
Mozley & Whitley.
Tender of Issue
A form of words in a pleading, by which a par-
ty offers to refer the question raised upon it to
the appropriate mode of decision. The common
tender of an issue of fact by a defendant is ex-
pressed by the words, "and of this he puts himself
upon the country." Steph.Pl. 54, 230.

## TENEMENT

This term, in its vulgar accepta-
tion, is only applied to houses and other buildings,
but in its original, proper, and legal sense it sig-
nifies everything that may be holden, provided it
be of a permanent nature, whether it be of a sub-
stantial and sensible, or of an unsubstantial, ideal,
kind. Thus, liberum tenementum, frank tene-
ment, or freehold, is applicable not only to lands
and other solid objects, but also to offices, rents,
2 Bl.Comm. 16; Mitchell v. Warner, 5 Conn. 517;
Oskaloosa Water Co. v. Board of Equalization, 84
Iowa 407, 51 N.W. 18, 15 L.R.A. 296; Field v. Hig-
gins, 35 Me. 341.
Property held by tenant, everything of permanent nature
which may be holden, and, in more restrictive sense, house
or dwelling. Hughes v. Milby and Dow Coal and Mining
Co., 127 Okl. 30, 259 P. 559, 560.
Dominant Tenement
One for the benefit or advantage of which an
easement exists or is enjoyed.
Servient Tenement
One which is subject to the burden of an ease-
ment existing for or enjoyed by another tenement.
See Easement.

## TENEMENTAL LAND

Land distributed by a
lord among his tenants, as opposed to the de-
mesnes which were occupied by himself and his
servants. 2 Bl.Comm. 90.

## TENEMENTIS LEGATIS

An ancient writ, ly-
ing to the city of London, or any other corporation,
(where the old custom was that men might devise
by will lands and tenements, as well as goods and
chattels,) for the hearing and determining any
controversy touching the same. Reg.Orig. 244.

## TENENDAS

In Scotch law. The name of a
clause in charters of heritable rights, which de-
rives its name from its first words, "tenendas
prcedictas terras;" it points out the superior of
whom the lands are to be holden, and expresses
the particular tenure. Ersk. Inst. 2, 3, 24.

## TENENDUM

Lat. To be holden. It was used
to indicate the lord of whom the land was to be
held and the tenure by which it was to be held.
but, since all freehold tenures have been convert-
ed into socage, the tenendum is of no further
use, and is therefore joined in the habendum,—"to
have and to hold." 2 Bl.Comm. 298; 4 Cruise,
Dig. 26.

## TENENS

A tenant; the defendant in a real ac-
tion.

## TENENTIBUS IN ASSISA

NON ONERANDIS.
A writ that formerly lay for him to whom a dis-
seisor had alienated the land whereof he disseis-
ed another, that he should not be molested in as-
size for damages, if the disseisor had wherewith
to satisfy them. Reg. Orig. 214.

## TENERE

Lat. In the civil law. To hold; to
hold fast; to have in possession; to retain.
In relation to the doctrine of possession, this term ex-
presses merely the fact of manual detention, or the cor-
poral possession of any object, without involving the ques-
tion of title; while habere (and especially possidere) de-
notes the maintenance of possession by a lawful claim;
i. e., civil possession, as distinguished from mere natural
possession.
TENERL The Latin name for that clause in a
bond in which the obligor expresses that he is
"held and firmly bound" to the obligee, his heirs,
TENET; TENUIT. Lat. He holds; he held. In
the Latin forms of the writ of waste against a
tenant, these words introduced the allegation of
tenure. If the tenancy still existed, and recovery
of the land was sought, the former word was used,
(and the writ was said to be "in the tenet.") If
the tenancy had already determined, the latter
term was used, (the writ being described as "in
the tenuit,") and then damages only were sought.
TENHEDED, or TIENHEOFED. In old English
law., A dean. Cowell.

## TENMENTALE

The number of ten men, which
number, in the time of the Saxons, was called a
"decennary;" and ten decennaries made what was
called a "hundred." Also a duty or tribute paid
to the crown, consisting of two shillings for each
plowland. Enc.Lond.

## TENNE

A term of heraldry, meaning orange
color. In engravings it should be represented by
lines in bend sinister crossed by others bar-ways.
Heralds who blazon by the names of the heavenly
bodies, call it "dragon's head," and those who em-
ploy jewels, "jacinth." It is one of the colors
called "stainand." Wharton.

## TENOR

A term used in pleading to denote that
an exact copy is set out. 1 Chit.Crim.Law. 235.
By the tenor of a deed, or other instrument in
writing, is signified the matter contained therein,
according to the true intent and meaning thereof.
Cowell.
"Tenor," in pleading a written instrument, im-
ports that the very words are set out. "Pur-
port" does not import this, but is equivalent only
to "substance." Corn. v. Wright, 1 Cush. (Mass.)
65; Dana v. State, 2 Ohio St. 93; State v. Bonney,
34 Me. 384; State v. Atkins, 5 Blackf. (Ind.) 458;
State v. Chinn, 142 Mo. 507, 44 S.W. 245; Sauger-
ties Bank v. Delaware & Hudson Co., 204 App.Div.
211, 198 N.Y.S. 722, 723; State v. Collins, 297 Mo.
257, 248 S.W. 599, 602; Johns v. Rice, 165 Iowa, 233,
145 N.W. 290, 291.
The action of proving the tenor, in Scotland, is
an action for proving the contents and purport
of a deed which has been lost. Bell.

A certified copy of records of other courts re-
moved in chancery by certiorari. Gres.Eq.Ev. 309.

FEUD! NATURAM AC RATIONEM, IN CON-
TRACTU INTERPOSITA. Wright, Ten. 21. Ten-
ure is a compact contrary to the common nature
and reason of the fee, put into a contract.

## TENURE

The mode or system of holding lands
or tenements in subordination to some superior,
which, in the feudal ages, was the leading charac-
teristic of real property.
Tenure is the direct result of feudalism, which separated
the dominium directum, (the dominion of the soil, ) which
is placed mediately or immediately in the crown, from the
dominion utile, (the possessory title, ) the right to the
use and profits in the soil, designated by/the term "sei-
sin," which is the highest interest a subject can acquire.
Wharton: Kavanaugh v. Cohoes Power & Light Corpora-
tion, 187 N.Y.S. 216, 231, 114 Misc. 590.
Wharton gives the following list of tenures which were
ultimately developed:
Lay Tenures
I. Frank tenement, or freehold. (1) The military ten-
ures (abolished, except grand serjeanty, and reduced to
free socage tenures) were : Knight service proper, or ten-
ure in chivalry ; grand serjeanty ; cornage. (2) Free soc-
age, or plow-service; either petit serjeanty, tenure in
burgage, or gavelkind.
II. Villeinage. (1) Pure villeinage, (whence copyholds
at the lord's [nominal] will, which is regulated according
to custom). (2) Privileged villeinage, sometimes called
"villein socage," (whence tenure in ancient demesne,
which is an exalted species of copyhold, held according to
custom, and not according to the lord's will, ) and is of
three kinds : Tenure in ancient demesne ; privileged copy-
holds, customary freeholds, or free copyholds; copyholds
of base tenure.
I. Frankalmoigne, or free alms.
II. Tenure by divine service.
In its general sense, a mode of holding or oc-
cupying. Thus, we speak of the tenure of an of-
fice, meaning the manner in which it is held, es-
pecially with regard to time, (tenure for life, ten-
ure during good behavior,) and of tenure of land
in the sense of occupation or tenancy, especially
with reference to cultivation and questions of
political economy; e. g., tenure by peasant pro-

TESTAMENT. A disposition of personal proper-
ty to take place after the owner's decease, accord-

C.C.A.Tex., 54 F. 860, 865, 4 C.C.A. 622; Aubert's
Appeal, 109 Pa. 447, 1 A. 336; Conklin v. Egerton,
21 Wend., N.Y., 436; Ragsdale v. Booker, 2 Strob.
Eq. (S.C.) 348; In re Lester's Will, 100 N.J.Eq.
521, 136 P. 322.
The act of last will, clothed with certain solem-
nities, by which the testator disposes of his prop-
erty, either universally, or by universal title, or
by particular title. Civ.Code La. art. 1571.
The common usage the world over is to employ the
words "will," "testament," and "last will and testament"
as exactly synonymous. Occidental Life Ins. Co. v. Pow-
ers, 192 Wash. 475, 74 P.2d 27, 32, 114 A.L.R. 531. But
strictly speaking, the term testament denotes only a will
of personal property; a will of land not being called a
"testament." Wyers v. Arnold, 347 Mo. 413, 147 S.W.2d
644, 647, 134 A.L.R. 876. The word "testament" is now
seldom used, except in the heading of a formal will, which
usually begins : "This is the last will and testament of me,
A. B.," etc. Sweet.
The true declaration of a man's last will as to that
which he would have to be done, aster his death. It is
compounded, according to Justinian, from testatio mentis;
but the better opinion is that it is a simple word formed
from the Latin testor, and not a compound word. Mozley
& Whitley.
Military Testament
In English law. A nuncupative will, that is, one
made by word of mouth, by which a soldier may
dispose of his goods, pay, and other personal chat-
tels, without the forms and solemnities which the
law requires in other cases. St. 1 Vict. c. 26, § 11.
Mutual Testaments
Wills made by two persons who leave their ef-
fects reciprocally to the survivor.
Mystic Testament
A form of testament made under Spanish law
which prevailed in Louisiana and California. See
Broutin v. Vassant, 5 Mart. O.S. (La.) 182; Schoul.
Wills § 9. In the law of Louisiana. A sealed tes-
tament. The mystic or secret testament, other-
wise called the "closed testament," is made in the
following manner: The testator must sign his dis-
positions, whether he has written them himself or
has caused them_to be written by another person.
The paper containing those dispositions, or the pa-
per serving as their envelope, must–be closed and
sealed. The testator shall present it thus closed
and sealed to the notary and to seven witnesses,
or he shall cause it to be closed and sealed in their
presence. Then he shall declare to the notary, in
presence of the witnesses, that that paper contains
his testament written by himself, or by another by
his direction, and signed by him, the testator.
The notary shall then draw up the act of super-
scription, which shall be written on that paper,
or on the sheet that serves as its envelope, and
that act shall be signed by the testator, and by
the notary and the witnesses. Civ.Code La. art.
TESTAMENTA CUM DUO INTER SE PUGNAN-
TIA REPERIUNTUR, ULTIMUM RATUM EST;
SIC EST, CUM DUO INTER SE PUGNANTIA
REPERIUNTUR IN EODEM TESTAMENTO.
Co.Litt. 112. When two conflicting wills are found,
the last prevails; so it is when two conflicting
clauses occur in the same will.

## TESTAMENTARY

Pertaining to a will or testa-
ment; as testamentary causes. Derived from,
founded on, or appointed by a testament or will;
as a testamentary guardian, letters testamentary,
etc.
A paper, instrument, document, gift, appoint-
ment, etc., is said to be "testamentary" when it
is written or made so as not to take effect until
after the death of the person making it, and to
be revocable and retain the property under his
control during his life, although he may have be-
lieved that it would operate as an instrument of
a different character. Sweet. See In re Murphy's
Estate, 193 Wash. 400, 75 P.2d 916, 920.
Letters Testamentary
The formal instrument of authority and ap-
pointment given to an executor by the proper
court, upon the admission of the will to probate,
empowering him to enter upon the discharge of
his office as executor.
Testamentary Capacity
That measure of mental ability which is recog-
nized in law as sufficient for the making a will.
See Nicewander v. Nicewander, 151 Ill. 156, 37 N.
E. 698; Delafield v. Parish, 25 N.Y. 29; Duffield
v. Robeson, 2 Har. (Del.) 379; Lowe v. Williamson,
2 N.J.Eq. 85.
A testator to have such capacity must have sufficient
mind and memory to intelligently understand the nature
of business in which he is engaged, to comprehend gen-
erally the nature and extent of property which constitutes
his estate, and which he intends to dispose of, and to recol-
lect the objects of his bounty. In re Larsen's Estate, 191
Wash. 257, 71 P.2d 47, 49. And it depends upon capacity
at very time will was executed, and not previously or
subsequently. Bishop v. Scharf, 214 Iowa 644, 241 N.W.
3, 7.
Testamentary Causes
In English law. Causes or matters relating to
the probate of wills, the granting of administra-
tions, and the suing for legacies, of which the ec-
clesiastical courts have jurisdiction. 3 Bl.Comm.
95, 98. Testamentary causes are causes relating
to the validity and execution of wills. The phrase
is generally confined to those causes which were
formerly matters of ecclesiastical jurisdiction, and
are now dealt with by the court of probate. Moz-
ley & Whitley.
Testamentary Class
Body of persons, uncertain in number at time of
gift, ascertainable. in future, and each taking in
equal or in other definite proportions. Newlin v.
Mercantile Trust- Co. of Baltimore, 161 Md. 622,
158 A. 51, 57.
Testamentary Disposition

Fidelity Ins., etc., Co., 40 A. 486, 186 Pa. 333, 65

A. 919, 921.
Testamentary Guardian

er for the person and real and personal estate of
his child until the latter arrives of full age. 1
Bl.Comm. 462; 2 Kent, Comm. 224; In re De
Saulles, 101 Misc. 447, 167 N.Y.S. 445, 453.
Testamentary Paper or Instrument
An instrument in the nature of a will; an un-
probated will; a paper writing which is of the
character of a will, though not formally such,
and, if allowed as a testament, will have the ef-
fect of a will upon the devolution and distribu-
tion of property. Young v. O'Donnell, 129 Wash.
219, 224 P. 682, 684.
Testamentary Power
A power of appointment exercisable only by
will. Restatement, Property, § 321(1).
Testamentary Succession

"Teste" is a word commonly used in the last part of
every writ, wherein the date is contained beginning with
the words, "Teste meipso," meaning the sovereign, if the
writ be an original writ, or be issued in the name of the
sovereign ; but, if the writ be a judicial writ, then the
word "Teste" is followed by the name of the chief judge
of the court in which the action is brought, or, in case of
a vacancy of such office, in the name of the senior puisne
judge. Mozley & Whitley.

## TESTED

## TESTES PONDERANTUR, NON NUMERAN- TUR

Witnesses are weighed, not numbered.
That is, in case of a conflict of evidence, the truth
is to be sought by weighing the credibility of the
respective witnesses, not by the mere numerical
preponderance on one side or the other.

## TESTES QUI POSTULAT DEBET DARE EIS SUMPTUS COMPETENTES

Whosoever de-
mands witnesses must find them in competent pro-
vision.

## TESTES, TRIAL PER

A trial had before a judge
without the intervention of a jury, in which the
judge is left to form in his own breast his sentence
upon the credit of the witnesses examined; but
this mode of trial, although it was common in
the civil law, was seldom resorted to in the prac-
tice of the common law, but it is now becoming
common when each party waives his right to a
trial by jury. Brown.
TESTIBUS DEPONENTHIUS IN PARI NU-
MERO, DIGNIORIBUS EST CREDENDUM.
Where the witnesses who testify are in equal num-
ber, [on both sides,] the more worthy are to be be-
lieved. 4 Inst. 279.

43 How.Prac. (N.Y.) 221; People v. Krotz, 341
Ill. 214, 172 N.E. 135, 137.

## TESTIMONIA PONDERANDA SUNT, NON NU- MERANDA

Evidence is to be weighed, not enu-
merated.

## TESTIMONIAL

Besides its ordinary meaning of
a written recommendation to character, "testimo-
nial" has a special meaning, under St. 39 Eliz. c.
17, § 3, passed in 1597, under which it signified a
certificate under the hand of a justice of the peace,
testifying the place and time when and where a
soldier or mariner landed, and the place of his
dwelling or birth, unto which he was to pass, and
a convenient time limited for his passage. Every
idle and wandering soldier or mariner not having
such a testimonial, or willfully exceeding for
above fourteen days the time limited thereby, or
forging or counterfeiting such testimonial, was to
suffer death as a felon, without benefit of clergy.
This act was repealed, in 1812, by St. 52 Geo. III.
c. 31. Mozley & Whitley.

## TESTIMONIAL PROOF

In the civil law. Proof

guished from evidence derived from writings, and
other sources. Edelstein v. United States, 79 C.C.

son v. Durant, 43 Okl. 799, 144 P. 592, 594; Cau-
ble v. Key, Tex.Civ.App., 256 S.W. 654, 655.
Evidence and Testimony as Synonymous
or Distinguishable
The words "testimony" and "evidence" are not
synonymous. Bednarik v. Bednarik, 18 N.J.Misc.
633, 16 A.2d 80, 89.
Although testimony is evidence, evidence may or may
not be testimony or may, and in most cases does, consist
of more than testimony, Superior Meat Products v. Hollo-
way, 113 Ill. App. 320, 48 N.E.2d 83, 86.
Anything perceptible to the five senses, constitutes evi-
dence, when submitted to court or jury, if competent, In
re Fisher's Estate, 47 Idaho 668, 279 P. 291, 293.
Application for policy, although evidence in suit on poli-
cy, was not "testimony," Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v.
Lodzinski, 121 N.J.Eq. 183, 188 A. 681, 688.
"Evidence" is the broader term and includes all testi-
mony. Bednarik v. Bednarik, 18 N.J.Misc. 633, 16 A.2d 80,
89. In re Seigle's Estate, 26 N.Y.S.2d 410, 413, 176 Misc.
"Evidence" of transaction between claimant and dece-
dent, were not "testimony." In re Seigle's Estate, 264
App.Div. 76, 34 N.Y.S.2d 489, 491.
Exhibits are "evidence" but not "testimony". Worland
v. McGill, 26 Ohio App. 442, 160 N.E. 478, 480; Madison v.
State, 138 Fla. 467, 189 So. 832, 835.
"Testimony" is found in spoken words of witnesses
while "evidence" includes documents and other exhibits
which may properly be submitted to jury. Madison v.
State, 138 Fla. 467, 189 So. 832, 835.
"Testimony" is that species of evidence which is pro-
duced through language of witnesses. Weeks v. Bailey,
33 N.M. 193, 263 P. 29, 30.
Testimony is one species of evidence. But the word
"evidence" is a generic term which includes every species
of it. Gazette Printing Co. v. Morss, 60 Ind. 157. Testi-
mony is the evidence given by witnesses. Evidence is
whatever may be given to the jury as tending to prove a
case. It includes the testimony of witnesses, documents,
admissions of parties, etc. Mann v. Higgins, 83 Cal. 66,
23 P. 206 ; Carroll v. Bancker, 43 La. Ann. 1078, 10 So. 192 ;
Columbia Nat. Bank v. German Nat. Bank, 56 Neb. 803, 77
N.W. 346; Harris v. Tomlinson, 130 Ind. 426, 30 N.E. 214;
Jones v. Gregory, 48 Ill.App. 230; Industrial Commission
v. Jasionowski, 24 Ohio App. 66, 156 N.E. 616, 618. What
is sworn is testimony; what is the truth deduced there-
from is "evidence." Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Rogers, 21
Ga.App. 324, 94 S.E. 321, 322; Mick v. Mart, N.J.Ch., 65 A.
But in common parlance, "testimony" and "evidence"
are synonymous. State v. Winney, 21 N.D. 72, 128 N.W.
680, 681; Jones v. City of Seattle, 51 Wash. 245, 98 P. 743,
745; Fitzgerald v. Benner, 219 Ill. 485, 76 N.E. 709, 716;:
Grayson v. Durant, 43 Okl. 799, 144 P. 592, 594.
Testimony properly means only such evidence as is de-
livered by a witness on the trial of a cause, either orally
or in the form of affidavits or depositions. Thus, an an-
cient deed, when offered under proper circumstances, is
evidence but it could not strictly be called "testimony."
The words "testimony" and "evidence," are fre-
quently used synonymously. Superior Lloyds of
America v. Foxworth, Tex.Civ.App., 178 S.W.2d
724, 726; Roberts v. Carlson, 142 Neb. 851, 857, 8
N.W.2d 175, 179; Wyuta Cattle Co. v. Connell, 43
Wyo. 135, 299 P. 279, 281.
As used in instruction "testimony" was used in the sense
of "evidence." In re Burcham's Estate, 211 Iowa 1395, 235.
N.W. 764, 766.
The use of the word "testimony" instead of "evidence"
in an instruction, where both oral evidence and physical
facts and circumstances are defensively interposed, is not
prejudicial where it is clear from all the instructions that
it was intended that such physical facts should also be con-
sidered by the jury. Roberts v. Carlson, 142 Neb. 857,
N.W.2d 175, 179.
The word "testimony" as used in statute providing that
when any deed, writing, or other document necessary as
"testimony" may be in possession of a resident who is
not a party subpoena duces tecum shall be issued on ap-
plication, means "evidence". Ex parte Hart,. 240, Ala. 642,.
200 So. 783, 786.
Expert Testimony
See Expert Evidence.
Testimony not bearing directly upon the imme-
diate fact or occurrence under consideration, but
evidencing facts from which it may be inferred
that the act or fact in question could not possibly
have happened. See Barclay v. Hartman, 43 A.
174, 2 Marv. (Del.) 351; Cinadar v. Detroit, G.
H. & M. Ry. Co., 193 Mich. 38, 159 N.W. 312;
Heywood v. State, 12 Ga.App. 643, 77 S.E. 1130;
Williams v. State, 23 Ga.App. 542, 99 S.E. 43.

Direct testimony that a thing did or did not
happen. Williams v. State, 23 Ga.App. 542, 99
S.E. 43; Roberts v. State, 90 Fla. 779, 107 So. 242,

dence in court, or who witnesses a document.

59 Cal.App.2d 255, 138 P.2d 763, 768. The object
of a right; e., whatever is treated by the law
as the object over which one person exercises a
right, and with reference to which another person
lies under a duty. Holl. Jur. 83.
The word "estate" in general Is applicable to anything
of which riches or fortune may consist. The word is like-
wise relative to the word "things," which is the second
object of jurisprudence, the rules of which are applicable
to persons, things, and actions. Civ.Code La. art. 448.
Such permanent objects, not being persons, as are sensi-
ble, or perceptible through the senses. Aust.Jur. § 452.
Things are distributed into three kinds : (1) Things real
or immovable, comprehending lands, tenements, and here-
ditaments ; (2) things personal or movable, comprehending
goods and chattels ; and (3) things mixed, partaking of
the characteristics of the two former, as a title-deed, a

cution is levied on property which does not belong
to the defendant, but to an outsider, the remedy
of the owner is by an intervention called a "third

315, 20 N.Y.S.2d 544, 547.

## THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY

In order for
one not privy to a contract to maintain an action
thereon as a "third party beneficiary", it must
appear that the contract was made and intended
for his benefit. Fagliarone v. Consolidated Film
Industries, 20 N.J.Misc. 193, 26 A.2d 425, 426. And
the benefit must be one that is not merely inci-
dental, but must be immediate in such a sense and
degree as to indicate the assumption of a duty to
make reparation if the benefit is lost. Associated

ment. Speculation of this kind frequently leads
to abuse, especially when the theater is full and
but few tickets are left, so that extortionate pric-
es may be exacted. Levine v. Brooklyn Nat.
League Baseball Club, 179 Misc. 22, 36 N.Y.S.2d
474, 477.

## TIDAL

## TILLAGE

der cultivation, as opposed to lands lying fallow

## TIMBER

Wood felled for building or other such
like use. In a legal sense it generally means (in
England) oak, ash, and elm, but in some parts
of England, and generally in America, it is used
in a wider sense, which is recognized by the law.
The term "timber," as used in commerce, refers gen-
erally only to large sticks of wood, squared or capable of
being squared for building houses or vessels; and certain
trees only having been formerly used for such purposes,
namely, the oak, the ash, and the elm, they alone were
recognized as timber trees. But the numerous uses to which
wood has come to be applied, and the general employment
of all kinds of trees for some valuable purpose, has wrought
a change in the general acceptation of terms in connection
therewith, and we find that Webster defines "timber" to be
"that sort of wood which is proper for buildings
tools, utensils, furniture, carriages, fences, ships, and the
like." This would Include all sorts of wood from which
any useful articles may be made, or which may be used to
advantage in any class of manufacture or construction.

mencing from the beginning of the reign of Rich-

be accounted vain.

## TINBOUNDING

A custom regulating the man-
ner in which tin is obtained from wasteland, or
land which has formerly been wasteland, within
certain districts in Cornwall and Devon. The cus-
tom is described in the leading case on the sub-
ject as follows: "Any person may enter on the
waste-land of another, and may mark out by four
corner boundaries a certain area. A written de-
scription of the plot of land so marked out with
metes and bounds, and the name of the person,
is recorded in the local stannaries court, and is
proclaimed on three successive court-days. If no
objection is sustained by any other person, the
court awards a writ to the bailiff to deliver pos-
session of the said 'bounds of tinwork' to the
`bounder,' who thereupon has the exclusive right
to search for, dig, and take for his own use all tin
and tin-ore within the inclosed limits, paying as a
royalty to the owner of the waste a certain pro-
portion of the produce under the name of 'toll-
tin.' " 10 Q.B. 26, cited in Elton Commons, 113.
The right of tinbounding is not a right of com-
mon, but is an interest in land, and, in Devon-
shire, a corporeal hereditament. In Cornwall tin
bounds are personal estate. Sweet.

And a tithe rent-charge unpaid is recoverable by
distress as rent in arrear. Mozley & Whitley.

## TITHING

One of the civil divisions of England,
being a portion of that greater division called
a "hundred." It was so called because ten free-
holders with their families composed one. It is
said that they were all knit together in one so-
ciety, and bound to the king for the peaceable be-
havior of each other. In each of these societies
there was one chief or principal person, who, from
his office, was called "teothing-man," now "tith-
ing-man." Brown.
TITHING-MAN,
Modern Law
A constable. "After the introduction of justices
of the peace, the offices of constable and tithing-
man became so similar that we now regard them
as precisely the same." Willc. Const. Introd.
New England

## TITHING-PENNY

In Saxon and old English
law. Money paid to the sheriff by the several
tithings of his county. Cowell.

## TITIUS

In Roman law. A proper name, fre-
quently used in designating an indefthite or ficti-
tious person, or a person referred to by way of
illustration. "Titius" and "Seius," in this use,
correspond to "John Doe" and "Richard Roe,"
or to "A. B." and "C. D."
TITLE. The radical meaning of this word ap-
pears to be that of a mark, style, or designation;
a distinctive appellation; the name by which any-
thing is known. Thus, in the law of persons, a
title is an appellation of dignity or distinction, a
name denoting the social rank of the person bear-
ing it; as "duke" or "count." So, in legislation,
the title of a statute is the heading or prelimin-
ary part, furnishing the name by which the act
is individually known. It is usually prefixed to
the statute in the form of a brief summary of
its contents; as "An act for the prevention of
gaming." State v. Thomas, 301 Mo. 603, 256 S.W.
1028, 1029. Again, the title of a patent is the
short description of the invention, which is copied
in the letters patent from the inventor's petition;
e. g., "a new and improved method of drying and
preparing malt." Johns. Pat. Man. 90.
The title of a book, or any literary composition,
is its name; that is, the heading or caption pre-
fixed to it, and disclosing the distinctive appella-
tion by which it is to be known. This usually
comprises a brief description of its subject-matter
and the name of its author.
"Title" is also used as the name of one of the subdivi-
sions employed in many literary works, standing inter-
mediate between the divisions denoted by the term
"books" or "parts," and those designated as "chapters"
and "sections."
Law of Trade-Marks
A title may become a subject of property; as
one who has adopted a particular title for a news-
paper, or other business enterprise, may, by long
and prior user, or by compliance with statutory
provisions as to registration and notice, acquire
a right to be protected in the exclusive use of it.
Abbott.
Real Property Law
Title is the means whereby the owner of lands
has the just possession of his property. Co. Litt.
345; 2 Bl.Comm. 195; Homey v.. Price, 189 N.C.
820, 128 S.E. 321, 323; Hahn v. Fletcher, 189 N.C.
729, 128 S.E. 326, 327; Wimpey v. Ledford, Mo.
Sup., 11 A.L.R. 7, 177 S.W. 302, 304; Case v. Mort-
gage Guarantee and Title Co., 52 R.I. 155, 158 A.
724, 726. The union of all the elements which
constitute ownership. Carroll v. City of Newark,
108 N.J.L. 323, 158 A. 458, 461. Full, independent
and fee ownership. In re Pelis' Estate, 150 Misc.
918, 271 N.Y.S. 731. The right to or ownership in
land. Andrews v. New Britain Nat. Bank, 113
Conn. 467, 155 A. 838, 840.
Title may be defined generally to be the evidence of
right which a person has to the possession of property.
The word "title" certainly does not merely signify the
right which a person has to the possession of property;
because there are many instances in which a person may
have the right to the possession of property, and at the
same time have no title to the same. In its ordinary legal
acceptation, however, it generally seems to imply a right
of possession also. It ,therefore, appears, on the whole, to
signify the outward evidence of the right, rather than the
mere right itself. Thus, when it is said that the "most
Imperfect degree of title consists in the mere naked pos-
session or actual occupation of an estate," it means that
the mere circumstance of occupying the estate is the weak-
est species of evidence of the occupier's right to such pos-
session. The word is defined by Sir Edward Coke thus :
Titulus est justa causa possidendi id quod nostrum est,
(1 Inst. 34;) that is to say, the ground whether purchase,
gift, or other such ground of acquiring; "titulus" being
distinguished in this respect from "modus acquirendi,"
which is the traditio, e., delivery or conveyance of the
thing. Brown.
Title is when a man hath lawful cause of entry into
lands, whereof another is seised; and it signifies also the
means whereby a man comes to lands or tenements, as by
feoffment, last will and testament, etc. The word "title"
includes a right, but is the more general word. Every
right is a title, though every title is not a right, for which
an action lies. Jacob.
The investigation of titles is one of the principal branch-
es of conveyancing and in that practice the word "title"
has acquired the sense of "history," rather than of "right."
Thus, we speak of an abstract of title, and of investigat-
ing a title, and describe a document as forming part of the
title to property. Sweet.
Pleading
The right of action which the plaintiff has. The
declaration must show the plaintiff's title, and, if
such title be not shown in that instrument, the
defect cannot be cured by any of the future plead-
ings. Bac. Abr. "Pleas," etc., B 1.
Procedure
Every action, petition, or other proceeding has
a title, which consists of the name of the court
in which it is pending, the names of the parties,
etc. Administration actions are further distin-
guished by the name of the deceased person whose
estate is being administered. Every pleading,
summons, affidavit, etc., commences with the title.
In many cases it is sufficient to give what is called
the "short title" of an action, namely, the court,
the reference to the record, and the surnames
of the first plaintiff and the first defendant.
Sweet.
General
Absolute title. As applied to title to land, an
exclusive title, or at least a title which excludes
all others not compatible with it; an absolute
title to land cannot exist at the same time in
different persons or in different governments.
Johnson v. McIntosh, 21 U.S. 543, 8 Wheat. 543,
5,98, 5 L.Ed. 681.
Abstract of title. See that title.
Adverse title. A title set up in opposition to or
defeasance of another title, or one acquired or
claimed by adverse possession.
Bond for title. See Bond.
Chain of title. See that title.
Clear title, good title, merchantable title, mar-
ketable title, are synonymous; "clear title" mean-
ing that the land is free from incumbrances, "good
title" being one free from litigation, palpable de-
fects, and grave doubts, comprising both legal and
equitable titles and fairly deducible of record.
Ogg v. Herman, 71 Mont. 10, 227 P. 476, 477;
Veselka v. Forres, Tex.Civ.App., 283 S.W. 303, 306;
Sipe v. Greenfield, 116 Okl. 241, 244 P. 424, 425.
Clear title of record, or clear record title, means
freedom from apparent defects, grave doubts, and
litigious uncertainties, and is such title as a rea-
sonably prudent person, with full knowledge,
would accept. A title dependent for its validity
on extraneous evidence, ex parte affidavits, or
written guaranties against the results of litigation
is not a clear title of record, and is not such title
as equity will require a purchaser to accept. Am-
merman v. Karnowski, 109 Okl. 156, 234 P. 774,
776; Cleval v. Sullivan, 258 Mass. 348, 154 N.E.
920, 921.
Color of title. See that title.
Covenants for title. Covenants usually inserted
in a conveyance of land, on the part of the gran-
tor, and binding him for the completeness, securi-
ty, and continuance of the title transferred to the
grantee. They comprise "covenants for seisin,
for right to convey, against incumbrances, for
quiet enjoyment, sometimes 'for further assurance,
and almost always of warranty." Rawle, Coy. §
Doubtful title. See that title.
Equitable title. A right in the party to whom it
belongs to have the legal title transferred to him;
or the beneficial interest of one person whom
equity regards as the real owner, although the
legal title is vested in another. Wyatt v. Meade
County Bank, 40 S.D. 111, 166 N.W. 423, 424;
Pogue v. Simon, 47 Or. 6, 81 P. 566, 567, 114 Am.

son, 5 How. (Miss.) 365, 385, quoted in Ayres v.
U. S., 42 Ct.C1. 385, 413. See Equitable Estate.
Examination of title, see Examination.
Imperfect title. One which requires a further
exercise of the granting power to pass the fee in
land, or which does not convey full and absolute
dominion. Paschal v. Perez, 7 Tex. 367; Paschal
v. Dangerfield, 37 Tex. 300; Lambert v. Gant. Tex.
Civ.App., 290 S.W. 548, 551.
Legal title. See that title.
Lucrative title. In the civil law, title acquired
without the giving of anything in exchange for it;
the title by which a person acquires anything
which comes to him as a clear gain, as, for in-
stance, by gift, descent, or devise. Opposed to
"onerous title," as to which see infra.
Marketable title. See that title.
Onerous title. In the civil law, title to prop-
erty acquired by the giving of a valuable consid-
eration for it, such as the payment of money, the
rendition of services, the performance of condi-
tions, the assumption of obligations, or the dis-
charge of liens on the property; opposed to "lu-
crative" title, or one acquired by gift or otherwise
without the giving of an equivalent. Scott v.
Ward, 13 Cal. 471; Kircher v. Murray, C.C.A.Tex.,
Civ.Code La. 1900, art. 3556, subd. 22.
Paper title. A title to land evidenced by a con-
veyance or chain of conveyances; the term gen-
erally implying that such title, while it has color
or plausibility, is without substantial validity.
Passive title. In Scotch law. A title incurred
by an heir in heritage who does not enter as heir
in the regular way, and therefore incurs liability
for all the debts of the decedent, irrespective of
the amount of assets. Paterson.
Perfect title. Various meanings have been at-
tached to this term: (1) One which shows the
absolute right of possession and of property in a
particular person. Henderson v. Beatty, 124

The elements of "title by prescription" are open, visible
and continuous use under a claim of right, adverse to and
with knowledge of owner. Dry Gulch Ditch Co. v. Hutton,
170 Or. 656, 133 P.2d 601, 610.
Such title is equivalent to a "title by deed" and cannot
be lost or divested except in the same manner, and mere
recognition of title in another after such acquisition will
not operate to divest the adverse claimant of that which
he has acquired. Maloney v. Bedford, 290 Ky. 647, 162 S.
W.2d 198, 199.
Title by descent. That title which one acquires

Recop. b. 1, tit. 5, c. 3, § 2.

## TITULARS OF ERECTION

Persons who in
Scotland, after the Reformation, obtained grants
from the crown of the monasteries and priories
then erected into temporal lordships. Thus the
titles formerly held by the religious houses, as
well as the property of the lands, were conferred
on these grantees, who were also called "lords of
erection" and "titulars of the teinds." Bell.

## TITULUS

Lat. Title. In the civil law. The
source or ground of possession; the means where-
by possession of a thing is acquired, whether
such possession be lawful or not.
the material edifice. So called because the priest
in charge of it derived therefrom his name and
title. Spelman.
TITULUS EST JUSTA CAUSA POSSIDENDI ID
QUOD NOSTRUM EST; DICITUR A TUENDO.
8 Coke, 153. A title is the just right of possessing
that which is our own; it is so called from "tuen-
do," defending.
TO. This is ordinarily a word of exclusion, when
used in describing premises; it excludes the term-
inus mentioned. Littlefield v. Hubbard, 120 Me.
226, 113 A. 304, 306; Sinford v. Watts, 123 Me. 230,
122 A. 573, 574; Skeritt Inv. Co. v. City of Engle-
wood, 79 Colo. 645, 248 P. 6, 8. It may be a word
of inclusion, and may also mean "into." People

v. Reynolds, 59 Utah, 416, 204 P. 516, 518.

## TO HAVE AND TO HOLD

The words in a con-
veyance which show the estate intended to be
conveyed. Thus, in a conveyance of land in fee-
simple, the grant is to "A. and his heirs, to have
and to hold the said [land] unto and to the use
of the said A., his heirs and assigns forever."
Williams, Real Prop. 198.
Strictly speaking, however, the words "to have" denote
the estate to be taken, while the words "to hold" signify
that it is to be held of some superior lord, i. e., by way of
tenure, (q. v.). The former clause is called the "haben-
dum;" the latter, the "tenendum." Co. Litt. 6a.

## TO WIT

That is to say; namely; scilicet; vide-
licet. Spears v. Wise, 187 Ala. 346, 65 So. 786;

han, C.C.A.Mo., 108 F.2d 306, 308, 309.

## TOKEN

A sign or mark; a material evidence
of the existence of a fact. Thus, cheating by
"false tokens" implies the use of fabricated or
deceitfully contrived material objects to assist
the person's own fraud and falsehood in accom-
plishing the cheat. See State v. Green, 18 N.J.
Law, 181; State v. Leonard, 73 Or. 451, 144 P. 113,
118; Smith v. State, 74 Fla. 594, 77 So. 274, 277;

Toll Bridge Authority v. Yelle, 195 Wash. 636, 82
P.2d 120, 125.
In English law. An excise of goods; a seizure
of some part for permission of the rest. It has
two significations: A liberty to buy and sell with-
in the precincts of the manor, which seems to im-
port as much as a fair or market; a tribute or
custom paid for passage. Wharton.
A Saxon word signifying, properly, a payment in towns,
markets, and fairs for goods and cattle bought and sold.
It is a reasonable sum of money due to the owner of the
fair or market, upon sale of things tollable within the
same. The word is used for a liberty as well to take as to
be free from toll. Jacob.

appear to have imported the privileges of having
a market, and jurisdiction of villeins. See Team.
Toll Bridge

bridge built by general taxation, the only differ-
ence being that it is made at the expense of others,
instead of the public, and the cost of construction
and maintenance is reimbursed by a toll fixed for
the purpose. White River Bridge Co. v. Hurd,
159 Ark. 652, 252 S.W. 917.
Toll Road
A road or highway over which the public has
the right to travel upon payment of toll, and on
which the parties entitled to such toll have the
right to erect gates and bars to insure its payment.

C.A. § 4201) ; Chemung Iron & Steel Co. v. Mer-
sereau Metal Bed Co., Sup., 179 N.Y.S. 577, 578.

## TONNAGE

The capacity of a vessel for carry-
ing freight or other loads, calculated in tons. But
the way of estimating the tonnage varies in differ-
ent countries. In England, tonnage denotes the
actual weight in tons which the vessel can safely
carry; in America, her carrying capacity estimat-
ed from the cubic dimensions of the hold. See
Roberts v. Opdyke, 40 N.Y. 259; Kiessig v. San
Diego County, 51 Cal.App.2d 47, 124 P.2d 163, 166.
The "tonnage" of a vessel is her capacity to carry cargo,
and a charter of "the whole tonnage" of a ship transfers
to the charterer only the space necessary for that purpose.
Thwing v. Insurance Co., 103 Mass. 405, 4 Am.Rep. 567.
The tonnage of a vessel is her internal cubical capacity,
in tons. Inman S. S. Co. v, Tinker, 94 U.S. 238, 24 L.Ed.
TONNAGE—DUTY.
In American law. A tax laid upon vessels ac-
A tonnage duty is a duty imposed on vessels in propor-
tion to their capacity. The vital principle of a tonnage
duty is that it is imposed, whatever the subject, solely
according to the rule of weight; either as to the capacity to
carry or the actual weight of the thing itself. Inman S. S.
Co. v. Tinker, 94 U.S. 238, 24 L.Ed. 118; Ross v. Mayor
and Council of Borough of Edgewater, 115 N.J.L. 477, 180
A. 866.
A tonnage tax is defined to be a duty levied on a vessel
according to the tonnage or capacity. It is a tax upon
the boat as an instrument of navigation, and not a tax
upon the property of a citizen of the state. The Math
Cape, 6 Biss. 505. Fed.Cas.No.10,316.
In English law. A duty imposed by parliament
upon merchandise exported and imported, accord.
ing to a certain rate upon every ton. Brown.

impost upon wines and other merchandise export-
ed or imported, according to a certain rate per

Lat. In old English law. A shaving,
or polling; the having the crown of the head

clerk or clergyman.

## TONSURE

In old English law. A being shaven;
the having the head shaven; a shaven head. 4
Bl. Comm. 367.

## TONTINE

In French law. A species of asso-
ciation or partnership formed among persons who
are in receipt of perpetual or life annuities, with
the agreement that the shares or annuities of
those who die shall accrue to the survivors. This
plan is said to be thus named from Tonti, an Ital-
ian, who invented it in the seventeenth century.
The principle is used in some forms of life insur-
ance. Merl. Repert; Cahn v. Northwestern Mut.
Life Ins. Co., 208 Ill.App. 317, 322; Gourley v.
Northwestern Nat. Life Ins. Co., 94 Okl. 46, 220 P.
645, 646.
Under the "Tontine" plan of insurance, no accumulation
or earnings are credited to the policy unless it remains in
force for the Tontine period of a specified number of years.
Thus those who survive the period and keep their policies
in force share in the accumulated funds and those who die
or permit their policies to lapse during period do not;
neither do their beneficiaries participate in such accumula-
tion. Commercial Travelers' Ins. Co. v. Carlson, 104 Utah
41, 137 P.2d 656, 660.

## TOOK AND CARRIED AWAY

ing. Technical words necessary in an indictment
for simple larceny.

is, an instrument to be used and managed by the
hand instead of being moved and controlled by

124 Mass. 420, 26 Am.Rep. 671; Reffitt v. Southern
157; Sturgis Nat. Bank v. Maryland Casualty Co.,
252 Mich. 426, 233 N.W. 367, 369.
Simple Tool
In law of Master and Servant. One whose con-
dition can be seen at a glance, or by slightest in-
spection. Track wrench used to tighten and loosen
nuts on railroad track held "simple tool." Allen
Gravel Co. v. Yarbrough, 133 Mass. 652, 98 So. 117,
118; Arkansas Cent. R. Co. v. Goad, 136 Ark. 467,
206 S.W. 901, 902; Swaim v. Chicago, R. I. & P.
Ry. Co., Iowa, 170 N.W. 296, 299; Kromer v. Minne-
apolis, St. P. & S. S. M. Ry. Co., 139 Minn. 424,
166 N.W. 1072, 1073; Ronconi v. Northwestern
Pac. R. Co., 35 Cal.App. 560, 170 P. 635, 636.
"Simple tool doctrine" is based on the idea that ordi-
narily an employee has better opportunity than employer
to observe defects and guard himself against them and
that the employer should not be charged with duty of care
or safety of employee with respect to a matter in which
the employee is in better position to care for himself. A
"tool" is an instrument of manual operation. Tucker v.
Holly Hill Lumber Co., 200 S.C. 259, 20 S.E.2d 704, 706.
Tools of Trade, Apparatus of Trade
And like terms under exemption statutes and
bankruptcy act cover tools that vary according to
the trade, handicraft or art in which they are
used. The meaning of the word "tool" dominates
the meaning of such terms. Corner v. Powell,
Tex.Civ.App., 189 S.W. 88, 91; Lindquist v. Clay-
ton, 54 Utah 79, 179 P. 655, 656; Hooper v. Ken-
nedy, 100 Vt. 314, 137 A. 194, 196; Busse v. Mur-
ray Meat & Live Stock Co., 45 Utah 596, 147 P.
626, 628.

## TORPEDO DOCTRINE

Attractive nuisance doc-
trine. Schock v. Ringling Bros. and Barnum &
Bailey Combined Shows, 5 Wash.2d 599, 105 P.2d
838, 843.

## TORRENS TITLE SYSTEM

A system under
which, upon the landowner's application the court
may, after appropriate proceedings, direct the
issuance of a certificate of title. With exceptions,
this certificate is conclusive as to applicant's es-
tate in land. This system is so called, the author
being Sir Robert Torrens.
TORT (from Lat. torquere, to twist, tortus, twist-
ed, wrested aside). A private or civil wrong or
injury. A wrong independent of contract. 1 Hill,
Torts 1. A violation of a duty imposed by gen-
eral law or otherwise upon all persons occupying
the relation to each other which is involved in a
given transaction. Coleman v. California Yearly
Meeting of Friends Church, 27 Cal.App.2d 579, 81
P.2d 469, 470. There -must always be a violation
of some duty owing to plaintiff, and generally
such duty must arise by operation of law and not
by mere agreement of the parties. Diver v. Miller,
Del.Super., 148 A. 291, 293.
Three elements of every tort action are: Existence of
legal duty from defendant to plaintiff, breach of duty, and
damage as proximate result. City of Mobile v. McClure,
221 Ala. 51, 127 So. 832, 835.
A legal wrong committed upon the person or property
fraction of some public duty by which special damage •
accrues to the individual; (3) the violation of some private
obligation by which like damage accrues to the individual.
In the former case, no special damage is necessary to en-
title the party to recover. In the two latter cases, such
damage is necessary. Code Ga. 1882, § 2951 (Civ.Code 1910,
§ 4403). And see Hayes v. Insurance Co., 125 Ill. 626, 18
N.E. 322, 1 L.R.A. 303; Railway Co. v. Hennegan, 33 Tex.
Civ.App. 314, 76 S.W. 453. Churchill v. Howe, 186 Mich.
107, 152 N.W. 989, 991; Strachan Shipping Co. v. Hazlip-
Hood Cotton Co., 35 Ga.App. 94, 132 S.E. 454, 459; Keiper
v. Anderson, 138 Minn. 392, 165 N.W. 237, 239, I.4.R.A.1918C,
299. A violation of a right in rem which plaintiff has as
against all persons with whom he comes in contact or the
violation of a right which is created by law and not by any
act of parties. Mitchell v. Health Culture Co., 349 Mo. 475,
162 S.W.2d 233, 237.
Maritime Tort
See Maritime.
Personal Tort
One involving or consisting in an injury to the
person or to the reputation or feelings, as distin-
guished from an injury or damage to real or per-
sonal property, called a "property tort." Mum-
ford v. Wright, 12 Colo.App. 214, 55 P. 744. Gray
v. Blight, C.C.A.Colo., 112 F.2d 696, 699.
Property Tort
See Personal Tort, supra.
Quasi Tort
Though not a recognized term of English law,
may be conveniently used in those cases where a
man who has not committed a tort is liable as if
he had. Thus, a master is liable for wrongful
acts done by his servant in the course of his em-
ployment. Broom, Corn. Law, 690; Underh. Torts,
Willful Tort
See that title.

## TORT-FEASOR

A wrong-doer; one who com-
mits or is guilty of a tort. Gordon v. Lee, 133 Me.
361, 178 A. 353, 355.
Joint Tort•Feasors
To be "joint tort-feasors," the parties must ei-
ther act together in committing the wrong, or
their acts, if independent of each other, must
unite in causing a single injury. Young v. Dille,
127 Wash. 398, 220 P. 782, 784; Anderson v. Smith,
Tex.Civ.App., 231 S.W. 142, 144; Kirkland v. En-

not merely the estate of the person making the
conveyance, but the whole fee-simple, to the in-
jury of the person really entitled to the fee; and
they were hence called "tortious conveyances."

phia v. Strayhorn, Tex.Com.App., 211 S.W. 447,

60 S.W.2d 1046.

Actual total loss. The total loss of the vessel
covered by a policy of insurance, by its real and
substantive destruction, by injuries which leave it
no longer existing in specie, by its being reduced
to a wreck irretrievably beyond repair, or by its
being placed beyond the control of the insured and
beyond his power of recovery. Distinguished from
a constructive total loss, which occurs where the
vessel, though injured by the perils insured
against, remains in specie and capable of repair
or recovery, but at such an expense, or under such
other conditions, that the insured may claim the
whole amount of the policy upon abandoning the
vessel to the underwriters. In such cases the in-
sured is entitled to indemnity as for a total loss.
An exception to the rule requiring abandonment
is found in cases where the loss occurs in foreign
ports or seas, where it is impracticable to repair.
In such cases the master may sell the vessel for'
the benefit of all concerned, and the insured may
claim as for a total loss by accounting to the in-
surer for the amount realized on the sale.
Constructive total loss. See Actual total loss,
supra.
Partial loss. Where an injury results to the ves-
sel from a peril insured against, but where the
loss is neither actually nor constructively total.

## TOUCH

In insurance law. To stop at a port.
If there be liberty granted by the policy to touch,

object and the furtherance of the adventure, by
breaking bulk, or by discharging and taking in
cargo, provided it produces no unnecessary delay,
nor enhances nor varies the risk. 3 Kent, Comm.

## TOUCH AND STAY

Words frequently intro-
duced in policies of insurance, giving the party in-
sured the right to stop and stay at certain desig-
nated points in the course of the voyage. A vessel
which has the power to touch and stay at a place
in the course of the voyage must confine herself
strictly to the terms of the liberty so given; for
any attempt to trade at such a port during such
a stay, as, by shipping or landing goods, will
amount to a species of deviation which will dis-
charge the underwriters, unless the ship have also
liberty to trade as well as to touch and stay at
such a place. 1 Marsh. Ins. 275.

## TOUCHING A DEAD BODY

It was an ancient
superstition that the body of a murdered man
would bleed freshly when touched by his mur-

office is to point out distinctively the origin or
ownership of the articles to which it is affixed, it
follows that no sign or form of words can be ap-
propriated as a valid trade-mark which, from the
nature of the fact conveyed by its primary mean-
ing, others may employ with equal truth and with
equal right for the same purpose. Jantzen Knit-

"Trade-mark" is created chiefly by use, which must be
general, continuous, and exclusive and applied to goods and
used in trade under such circumstances of publicity and
length of use as to show intention to adopt mark for spe-
cific goods. Continental Corporation v. National Union
Radio Corporation, C.C.A.I11., 67 F.2d 938, 942.
A "trade-mark" is merely a protection for good will and
is not the subject of property rights except in connection
with an existing business. 15 U.S.C.A. § 90. Lazar v. Ce-
celia Co., D.C.N.Y., 30 F.Supp. 769, 771.

name" to a business and its good will. American Steel
Foundries v. Robertson, 46 S.Ct. 160, 162, 269 U.S. 372, 70

This is the statute 38 & 39 Vict. c. 91, amended by

## TRADE-NAME

A name used in trade to desig-
nate a particular business of certain individuals
considered somewhat as an entity, or the place at
which a business is located, or of a class of goods,
but which is not a technical trade-mark either
because not applied or affixed to goods sent into
the market or because not capable of exclusive
appropriation by anyone as a trade-mark. "Trade-
names" may, or may not, be exclusive. Non-ex-
clusive "trade-names" are names that are publici
juris in their primary sense, but which in a second-
ary sense have come to be understood as indicat-
ing the goods or business of a particular trader.
"Trade-names" are acquired by adoption and user
and belong to one who first used them and gave
them a value. St. Louis Independent Packing Co.
v. Houston, C.C.A.Mo., 215 F. 553, 560; Hartzler
v. Goshen Churn & Ladder Co., 55 Ind.App. 455,
104 N.E. 34, 37. See, also, Trade-mark. For "Fan-
ciful Trade-Name," see that title.
A "trade-name" is descriptive of the manufacturer or
dealer for protection in trade, to avoid confusion in busi-
ness, and to secure the advantages of a good reputatfon
and is applied more to the good will of a business than as
an identification of a product. Mary Muffet, Inc., v. Smel-
ansky, Mo.App., 158 S.W.2d 168, 170.

Hamilton, 208 Ky. 348, 270 S.W. 834, 835. A secret

c. 31, passed in 1871, for the purpose of giving
legal recognition to trade unions, is known as the
"trade-union act," or "trade-union funds protec-
tion act." It provides that the members of a trade
union shall not be prosecuted for conspiracy mere-
ly by reason that the rules of such union are in
restraint of trade; and that the agreements of
trade unions shall not on that account be void or
voidable. Provisions are also made with reference
to the registration and registered offices of trade
unions, and other purposes connected therewith.

A traveling salesman Is not employed or authorized to
fix prices. He cannot pass upon the credit or standing of
customers. He does not collect accounts. He is not re-
sponsible for the quality, condition or delivery of the
goods. He makes no personal contracts and he has no oth-
er interest in the sale than his compensation for those
which are approved by his employer. The territory as-
signed to him may be confined to a single city or state, or
it may cover cities or states. Commonly, the employer
pays the salesman's expenses, but sometimes, especially if
he works for a commission, he pays his own expenses.
Sometimes he is allotted a certain territory and he re-
ceives a commission upon all sales which are sent in from
that territory. In some cases the employer may direct the
routes he is to travel, and in other cases the salesman
chooses his own routes. Sometimes the salesman sends
the orders directly to his employer and sometimes the
customers themselves send in the orders to the employer.
He often sells after exhibiting samples. In re Herbert

## TRAVERSE

In the language of pleading, a tra-
verse signifies a denial. Thus, where a defendant
denies any material allegation of fact in the plain-
tiff's declaration, he is said to traverse it, and the
plea itself is thence frequently termed a "tra-
verse." Brown.
Criminal Practice
To put off or delay the trial of an indictment till
a succeeding term. More properly, to deny or take
issue upon an indictment. 4 Bl.Comm. 351.
General
Common traverse. A simple and direct denial
of the material allegations of the opposite plead-
ing, concluding to the country, and without in-
ducement or absque hoc.
General traverse. One preceded by a general
inducement, and denying in general terms all that
is last before alleged on the opposite side, instead
of pursuing the words of the allegations which it
denies. Gould.P1. vii. 5.
Special traverse. A peculiar form of traverse or
denial, the design of which, as distinguished from
a common traverse, is to explain or qualify the
denial, instead of putting it in the direct and
absolute form. It consists of an affirmative and
a negative part, the first setting forth the new
affirmative matter tending to explain or qualify
the denial, and technically called the "induce-
ment," and the latter constituting the direct denial
itself, and technically called the "absque hoc."
Steph.Pl. 169-180; Allen v. Stevens, 29 N.J.L. 513.,
Chambers v. Hunt, 18 N.J.L. 352; People v. Pull-

challenging, by a subject, of an inquest of office,
as being defective and untruly made. Mozley &
Whitley.

the same point or subject-matter as is embraced
in a preceding traverse on the other side.

## TRAVERSER

In pleading. One who traverses
or denies. A prisoner or party indicted; so called
from his traversing the indictment.

## TRAVERSING NOTE

This is a pleading in chan-
cery, and consists of a denial put in by the plain-
tiff on behalf of the defendant, generally denying
all the statements in the plaintiff's bill. The ef-
fect of it is to put the plaintiff upon proof of the
whole contents of his bill, and is only resorted to
for the purpose of saving time, and in a case
where the plaintiff can safely dispense with an an-
swer. A copy of the note must be served on the
defendant. Brown.
TREACHER, TRECHETOUR, or TREACHOUR.
A traitor.
TREAD-MILL, or TREAD-WHEEL. An instru-
ment of prison discipline, being a wheel or cylinder
it, up which the prisoners walk, and thus put the
axis in motion. The men hold on by a fixed rail,
and, as their weight presses down the step upon
which they tread, they ascend the next step, and
thus drive the wheel. Enc. Brit.

## TREASON

The offense of attempting by overt
acts to overthrow the government of the state to

taken severally do not amount to actual treason.
This doctrine is not known in the United States.

ing, etc., to depose her majesty from the crown;
or to levy war in order to intimidate either house
of parliament, etc., or to stir up foreigners by
any printing or writing to invade the kingdom.

under statutes 11 & 12 Vict. c. 12, § 3; 20 & 21
Vict. c. 3, § 2; 27 & 28 Vict. c. 47, § 2. By the
statute first above mentioned, the government is

TREATY.
International Law
A compact made between two or more inde-
pendent nations with a view to the public wel-
fare. Louis Wolf & Co. v. United States, Cust. &
Pat.App., 107 F.2d 819, 827; United States v. Bel-
mont, N.Y., 57 S.Ct. 758, 761, 301 U.S. 324, 81 L.
Ed. 1134.
An agreement, league, or contract between two
or more nations or sovereigns, formally signed by
commissioners properly authorized, and solemnly
ratified by the several sovereigns or the supreme
power of each state. Edye v. Robertson, 5 S.Ct.

C.C.Minn., 100 F. 962; Charlton v. Kelly, 33 S.Ct.

A "treaty" is not only a law but also a contract be-
tween two nations and must, if possible, be so construed as
to give full force and effect to all its parts. United States
v. Reid, C.C.A.Or., 73 F.2d 153, 155.
Personal treaties relate exclusively to the persons of the
contracting sovereigns, such as family alliances, and treat-
ies guaranteeing the throne to a particular sovereign and
his family. As they relate to the persons, they expire of
course on the death of the sovereign or the extinction of
his family. With the advent of constitutional government
in Europe these treaties have lost their importance. Real
treaties relate solely to the subject-matters of the conven-
tion, independently of the persons of the contracting par-
ties, and continue to bind the state, although there may
be changes in its constitution or in the persons of its rul-
ers. Boyd's Wheat. Int. Law § 29.
Private Law

cedes the conclusion of a contract or other trans-

valid, must be made during the "treaty" preced-
ing the sale. Chit. Cont. 419; Sweet.

commissa or fiduciary bequest—is no longer a
part of our law. Civ.Code La. art. 1520, par. 3.

## TREBLE COSTS

## TREBLE DAMAGES

In practice. Damages giv-
en by statute in certain cases, consisting of the
single damages found by the jury, actually tripled

Trespass, in its most comprehensive sense, signifies any
transgression or offense against the law of nature, of so-
ciety, or of the country in which we live; and this,
whether It relates to a man's person or to his property.
In its more limited and ordinary sense, it signifies an
iniury committed with violence, and this violence may be
either actual or implied; and the law will imply violence
tnough none is actually used, when the injury is of a di-
rect and immediate kind, and committed on the person or
tangible and corporeal property of the plaintiff. Of actual
violence, an assault and battery is an instance; of implied,
a peaceable but wrongful entry upon a person's land.

attendance of the public at large, or of persons
who may properly be admitted. "The requirement
of a public trial is for the benefit of the accused;
that the public may see, he is fairly dealt with
and not unjustly condemned, and that the pres-
ence of interested spectators may keep his triers
keenly alive to a sense of their responsibility and
to the importance of their functions; and the re-
quirement is fairly observed if, without partiality
or favoritism, a reasonable proportion of the pub-
lic is suffered to attend, notwithstanding that those
persons whose presence could be of no service to
the accused, and who would only be drawn thither
by a prurient curiosity, are excluded altogether."

dence of the person certifying was the only prop-

qualified, and lawful men, disinterested and im-
partial, not of kin nor personal dependents of
either of the parties, having their homes within
the jurisdictional limits of the court, drawn and
selected by officers free from all bias in favor of or
against either party, duly impaneled under the
direction of a competent court, sworn to render a
true verdict according to the law and the evidence
given them, who, after hearing the parties and
their evidence, and receiving the instructions of
the court relative to the law involved in the trial,
and deliberating, when necessary, apart from all
extraneous influences, must return their unani-
mous verdict upon the issue submitted to them.

viso quod," etc., i. e., provided that. If plaintiff
take out any writ to that purpose, the sheriff shall
summon but one jury on them both. This is call-
ed "going to trial by proviso." Jacob, tit. "Pro-
viso."
Trial by the Record
A form of trial resorted to where issue is taken
upon a plea of nul tiel record, in which case the
party asserting the existence of a record as plead-
ed is bound to produce it in court on a day as-
signed. If the record is forthcoming, the issue
is tried by inspection and examination of it. If

Trial by Witnesses
The name "trial per testes" has been used for
a trial without the intervention of a jury, is the
only method of trial known to the civil law, and
is adopted by depositions in chancery. The judge
is thus left to form, in his own breast, his sen-
tence upon the credit of the witnesses examined.
But it is very rarely used at common law. Tom-
lins.

mento of victory or success; an ornamental group
of objects hung together on a wall, or any collec-
tion of objects typical of some event, art, indus-
try, or branch of knowledge; a memento or mem-

trover (or trover and conversion) is as jaecies of
action on the case, and originally lay for the re-
covery of damages against a person who had
found another's goods and wrongfully converted
them to his own use. Subsequently the allegation
of the loss of the goods by the plaintiff and the
finding of them by the defendant was merely fic-
titious, and the action became the remedy for any
wrongful interference with or detention of the
goods of another. 3 Steph.Comm. 425. Sweet.

## TRUCK ACTS

Acts in England, 1 & 2 Wm. IV,
amended in 1887 and 1896, which provide that
workmen shall not have unreasonable deductions
made from their wages (as for fines, damaged
goods, materials, or tools), nor have their wages
paid otherwise than in current coin, nor be ob-
liged to spend them in any particular place or man-
ner.

## TRUE

Conformable to fact; correct; exact;
actual; genuine; honest. See First State Bank of
Teague v. Hadden, Tex.Civ.App., 158 S.W. 1168,
In one sense, that only is "true" which is conformable
to the actual state of things. In that sense, a statement is
"untrue" which does not express things exactly as they
are. But in another and broader sense the word "true" is
often used as a synonym of "honest", "sincere", hot
"fraudulent." Zolintakis v. Equitable Life Assur. Soc. of
United States, C.C.A.Utah, 108 F.2d 902, 905; Moulor v.
American Life Ins. Co., 4 S.Ct. 466, 111 U.S. 335, 28 L.Ed.

## TRUE ADMISSION

A formal act done in course
of judicial proceedings which waives or dispenses
with production of evidence by conceding for pur-
poses of litigation that proposition of fact alleg-
ed by opponent is true. Maltz v. Jackoway-Katz
Cap Co., 336 Mo. 1000, 82 S.W.2d 909, 917.

## TRUE BILL

ment made by a grand jury upon a bill of indict-
ment, when they find it sustained by the evidence
laid before them, and are satisfied of the truth
of the accusation. 4 Bl.Comm. 306.

## TRUE COPY

A true copy, does not mean an ab-
solutely exact copy but means that the copy shall
be so true that anybody can understand it. It may
contain an error or omission. 51 L.J.Ch. 905.

## TRUE, PUBLIC, AND NOTORIOUS

These three
qualities used to be formally predicated in the
libel in the ecclesiastical courts, of the charges
which it contained, at the end of each article sev-
erally. Wharton.

## TRUE VALUE RULE

Under this rule, one who
subscribes for and receives corporate stock must
pay therefor the par value thereof either in mon-
ey or in money's worth, so that the real assets of .
the corporation shall at least square with its
books, and whenever, whether by fraud, accident
or mistake, the true value of property, labor or
services received in payment does not equal par
value, stock is deemed unpaid for to the full ex-
tent of the difference, and holders are liable to
creditors for the difference, notwithstanding good
faith of directors. Johansen v. St. Louis Union
Trust Co., 345 Mo. 135, 131 S.W.2d 599, 603.

## TRUE VERDICT

The voluntary conclusion of
the jury after deliberate consideration, and it is
none the less a true verdict because the respective
jurors may have been liberal in concessions to
each other, if conscientiously and freely made.
A verdict is not a "true verdict," the result of
any arbitrary rule or order, whether imposed by
themselves, or by the court or officer in charge.
Mann v. State, 26 Ala.App. 558, 163 So. 821.

TRUST.
1. In General
A right of property, real or personal, held by
one party for the benefit of another. See Good-
win v. McMinn, 193 Pa. 646, 44 A. 1094, 74 Am.St.
Rep. 703; Boyce v. Mosely, 102 S.C. 361, 86 S.E.

F.2d 849, 856, 857. A confidence reposed in one
person, who is termed trustee, for the benefit
of another, who is called the cestui que trust,
respecting property which is held by the trustee
for the benefit of the cestui que trust. State
ex rel. Wirt v. Superior Court for Spokane
County, 10 Wash.2d 362, 116 P.2d 752, 755. Any
arrangement whereby property is transferred with
intention that it be administered by trustee for
another's benefit. Raffo v. Foltz, 106 Cal.App. 51,
288 P. 884, 886.
A fiduciary relation with respect to property,
subjecting person by whom the property is held
to equitable duties to deal with the property for
the benefit of another person which arises as the
result of a manifestation of an intention to create
it. Goodenough v. Union Guardian Trust Co., 267
N.W. 772, 773, 774, 275 Mich. 698. An obligation
on a person arising out of confidence reposed in
him to apply property faithfully and according to
such confidence; as being in nature of deposi-
tion by which proprietor transfers to another
property of subject intrusted, not that it should
remain with him, but that it should be applied to
certain uses for the behoof of third party. Mac-
Kenzie v. Union Guardian Trust Co., 262 Mich. 563,
247 N.W. 914, 919; Gurnett v. Mutual Life Ins. Co.
of New York, 356 Ill. 612, 191 N.E. 250, 252.
A "trust" can be created for any purpose which is not il-
legal, and which is not against public policy. Collins v.
Lyon, Inc., 181 Va. 230, 24 S.E.2d 572, 579.
Essential elements of "trust" are designated beneficiary
and trustee, fund sufficiently identified to enable title to
pass to trustee, and actual delivery to trustee with inten-
tion of passing title. City Bank Farmers' Trust Co. v.
Charity Organization Soc. of City of New York, 238 App.
Div. 720, 265 N.Y.S. 267.
Accessory trust. In Scotch law, equivalent to
"active" or "special" trust. See infra.
Active trust. One which imposes upon the
trustee the duty of taking active measures in the
execution of the trust, as, where property is con-
veyed to trustees with directions to sell and dis-
tribute the proceeds among creditors of the gran-
tor; distinguished from a "passive" or "dry"
trust. In re Buch's Estate, 278 Pa. 185, 122 A.
239, 240; Welch v. Northern Bank & Trust Co., 100
Wash. 349, 170 P. 1029, 1032.
Cestui que trust. The person for whose benefit
a trust is created or who is to enjoy the income
or the avails of it.
Charitable trusts. Trusts designed for the bene-
fit of a class or the public generally. They are es-
sentially different from private trusts in that the
beneficiaries are uncertain. Bauer v. Myers, C.
C.A.Kan., 244 F. 902, 911.
Complete voluntary trust. One completely cre-
ated, the subject-matter being designated, the
trustee and beneficiary being named, and the limi-
tations and trusts being fully and perfectly de-
clared. In re Leigh's Estate, 186 Iowa 931, 173
N.W. 143, 146.
Constructive trust. A trust raised by construc-
tion of law, or arising by operation of law, as dis-
tinguished from an express trust. Wherever the
circumstances of a transaction are such that the
person who takes the legal estate in property can-
not also enjoy the beneficial interest without nec-
essarily violating some established principle of eq-
uity, the court will immediately raise a construc-
tive trust, and fasten it upon the conscience of the
legal owner, so as to convert him into a trustee
for the parties who in equity are entitled to the
beneficial enjoyment. Hill, Trustees, 116; 1
Spence, Eq.Jur. 511; Nester v. Gross, 66 Minn. 371,
69 N.W. 39; Porter v. Shaffer, 147 Va. 921, 133
S.E. 614, 616; Misamore v. Berglin, 197 Ala. 111,
72 So. 347, 349, L.R.A.1916F, 1024.
See, also, Involuntary Trust infra.
"Constructive trusts" do not arise by agreement or from
intention, but by operation of law, and fraud, active or
constructive, is their essential element. Actual fraud is
not necessary, but such a trust will arise whenever cir-
cumstances under which property was acquired made it in-
equitable that it should be retained by him who holds the
legal title. Constructive trusts have been said to arise
through the application of the doctrine of equitable estop-
pel, or unaer the broad doctrine that equity regards and
treats as done what in good conscience ought to be done,
and such trusts are also known as "trusts ex maleficio" or
"ex delicto" or "involuntary trusts" and their forms and
varieties are practically without limit, being raised by
courts of equity whenever it becomes necessary to prevent
a failure of justice. Union Guardian Trust Co. v. Emery,
292 Mich. 394, 290 N.W. 841, 845.
Contingent trust. An express trust depending
for its operation upon a future event. Civ.Code
Ga.1910, § 3734.
Direct trust. An express trust, as distinguished
from a constructive or implied trust. Currence
v. Ward, 43 W.Va. 367, 27 S.E. 329.
Directory trust. One which is not completely
and finally settled by the instrument creating it,
but only defined in its general purpose and to be
carried into detail according to later specific di-
rections.
Dry trust. One which merely vests the legal
title in the trustee, and does not require the per-
formance of any active duty on his part to carry
out the trust. In re Shaw's Estate, 198 Cal. 352,
246 P. 48, 52; Blackburn v. Blackburn, 167 Ky.
113, 180 S.W. 48, 49.
Educational trusts. Trusts for the founding,
endowing, and supporting schools for the advance-
ment of all useful branches of learning, which are
not strictly private. Richards v. Wilson, 185 Ind.
335, 112 N.E. 780, 794.
Executed trust. A trust of which the scheme
has in the outset been completely declared. Ad-
ams, Eq. 151. A trust in which the estates and
interest in the subject-matter of the trust are com-
pletely limited and defined by the instrument creat-
ing the trust, and require no further instruments
to complete them. Bisp.Eq. 20; Pillot v. Landon,
46 N.J.Eq. 310, 19 A. 25; Egerton v. Brownlow,
4 H.L.Cas. 210; Mattsen v. U. S. Ensilage Har-
vester Co., 171 Minn. 237, 213 N.W. 893, 895.
Executory trust. One which requires the execu-
tion of some further instrument, or the doing of
some further act, on the part of the creator of
the trust or of the trustee, towards its complete
creation or full effect. Martling v. Martling, 55
N.J.Eq. 771, 39 A. 203; Carradine v. Carradine,
33 Miss. 729; In re Fair's Estate, 132 Cal. 523, 60
P. 442, 84 Am.St.Rep. 70; Pillot v. Landon, 46 N.
J.Eq. 310, 19 A. 25.
Express active trust. Where will confers upon
executor authority to generally manage property
of estate and pay over net income to devisees or
legatees, such authority creates an "express active
P.2d 1017, 1020, 147 A.L.R. 598.
Express private passive trust has been defined as
existing where land is conveyed to or held by one
person in trust for another, without any power
being expressly or impliedly given trustee to take
actual possession of land or exercise acts of own-
ership over it, except by beneficiary's direction.

144 Md. 465, 125 A. 162, 166.
Instrumental trust. See Ministerial Trusts, in-
fra.
Involuntary trust. "Involuntary" or "construc-
tive" trusts embrace all those instances in which
a trust is raised by the doctrines of equity, for
the purpose of working out justice in the most
efficient manner, when there is no intention of
the parties to create a trust relation. This class
of trusts may usually be referred to fraud, either
actual or constructive, as an essential element.
Bank v. Kimball Milling Co., 1 S.D. 388, 47 N.W.
402, 36 Am.St.Rep. 739.
Massachusetts or business trusts. See "Trust
Estates as Business Companies."
Ministerial trusts. (Also called "instrumental.
trusts.") Those which demand no further exer-
cise of reason or understanding than every intelli-
gent agent must necessarily employ; as to con-

distinguished from discretionary trusts, which nec-
essarily require much exercise of the understand-
ing. 2 Bouv.Inst. no. 1896.
Naked trust. A dry or passive trust; one which
requires no action on the part of the trustee, be-

Precatory trust. Where words employed in a
will or other instrument do not amount to a posi-
tive command or to a distinct testamentary dis-
ommendation, or expectation, they are termed
"precatory words," and from such words the law
will raise a trust, called a "precatory trust," to
carry out the wishes of the testator or grantor.
See Bohon v. Barrett, 79 Ky. 378; Hunt v. Hunt,
18 Wash. 14, 50 P. 578; Aldrich v. Aldrich, 172
Mass. 101, 51 N.E. 449.
Private trust. One established or created for
the benefit of a certain designated individual or
individuals, or a known person or class of persons,
clearly identified or capable of identification by
the terms of the instrument creating the trust; as
distinguished from trusts for public institutions
or charitable uses. See Pennoyer v. Wadhams, 20
Or. 274, 25 P. 720, 11 L.R.A. 210; Doyle v. Whalen,

considered in general as synonymous expressions.
Lewin, Trusts, 20; Bauer v. Myers, C.C.A.Kan.,
244 F. 902, 911.
Resulting trust. One that arises by implication
of law, or by the operation and construction of
equity, and which is established as consonant to
the presumed intention of the parties as gathered
from the nature of the transaction. It arises
where the legal estate in property is disposed of,
conveyed, or transferred, but the intent appears
or is inferred from the terms of the disposition, or
from the accompanying facts and circumstances,
that the beneficial interest is not to go or be en-
joyed with the legal title. Lafkowitz v. Jackson,
C.C.A.Mo., 13 F.2d 370, 372. See Sanders v. Steele,
124 Ala. 415, 26 So. 882. Farwell v. Wilcox, 73

settled that it may operate in favor of beneficiar-
ies additional to, or substituted for, those first
named, upon specified contingencies. Civ.Code
Ga.1910, § 3734.
Simple trust. A simple trust corresponds with
the ancient use, and arises where property is sim-
ply vested in one person for the use of another,
and the nature of the trust, not being qualified by
the settlor, is left to the construction of law. Per-
kins v. Brinkley, 133 N.C. 154, 45 S.E. 541; Dod-
son v. Ball, 60 Pa. 500, 100 Am.Dec. 586.
posed for the execution of some purpose particu-
larly pointed out, and is not, as in case of a simple
trust, a mere passive depositary of the estate, but
is required to exert himself actively in the execu-
tion of the settlor's intention; as, where a con-
veyance is made to trustees upon trust to recon-
vey, or to sell for the payment of debts. Lew.Tr.
3, 16.
Special trusts have been divided into (1) ministerial (or
instrumental) and (2) discretionary. The former, such as
demand no further exercise of reason or understanding
than every intelligent agent must necessarily employ ; the
latter, such as cannot be duly administered without the
application of a certain degree of prudence and judgment.

45 S.E. 541.
Spendthrift trust. See Spendthrift.
Totten trust. A trust created by the deposit
by one person of his own money in his own name
as a trustee for another and it is a tentative
trust revocable at will until the depositor dies or
completes the gift in his lifetime by some unequiv-
ocal act or declaration such as delivery of the pass
book or notice to the beneficiary and if the deposi-
tor dies before the beneficiary without revocation
or some decisive act or declaration of disaffirm-
ance the presumption arises that an absolute trust
was created as to the balance on hand at the death
of the depositor. Murray v. Brooklyn Say. Bank,
258 App.Div. 132, 15 N.Y.S.2d 915, 917; In re Tot-
ten, 179 N.Y. 112, 71 N.E. 748, 70 L.R.A. 711, 1 Ann.

bonds, serving as trustee for their bond or mort-
gage creditors, and transacting a general banking

N.W. 987, 994; Guaranty Title & Trust Co. v.
Thompson, 93 Fla. 983, 113 So. 117, 120.

see, infra.
Trust ex maleficio. A species of constructive
trust arising out of some fraud, misconduct, or
breach of faith on the part of the person to be
charged as trustee, which renders it an equitable
necessity that a trust should be implied. See

v. Dean, 128 Ala. 600, 30 So. 543; Chanowsky v.
Friedman, Tex.Civ.App., 108 S.W.2d 752, 754. See,

Trust fund. A fund held by a trustee for the
specific purposes of the trust; in a more general
sense, a fund which, legally or equitably, is sub-
ject to be devoted to a particular purpose and
cannot or should not be diverted therefrom. In
this sense it is often said that the assets of a cor-
poration are a "trust fund" for the payment of its
debts. See Henderson v. Indiana Trust Co., 143

Trust fund doctrine. In substance, that where
corporation transfers all its assets with a view to
going out of business and nothing is left with
which to pay debts, transferee is charged with
notice of the circumstances of the transaction, and
takes the assets subject to an equitable lien for
the unpaid debts of the transferring company;
the property of a corporation being a fund subject
v. Export Lumber Co., C.C.A.Or., 67 F.2d 301, 304.
Under such doctrine, if insolvent corporation's assets are
distributed among its stockholders before its debts are
paid, each stockholder is liable to creditors for full amount
received by him. Scott v. Commissioner of Internal Rev-
enue, C.C.A.8, 117 F.2d 36, 39.
Trust in invitum. A constructive trust imposed
by equity, contrary to the trustee's intention and
will, upon property in his hands. Sanford v. Ham-
ner, 115 Ala. 406, 22 So. 117.
Trust legacy. See Legacy.
Trust receipt. Document in which is expressed
security transaction, whereunder the lender hav-
ing no prior title in the goods on which the lien
is to be given, and not having possession which
remains in the borrower, lends his money to the
borrower on security of the goods, which the bor-
rower is privileged to sell clear of the lien on
agreement to pay all or part of the proceeds of
the sale to the lender. In re Boswell, C.C.A.Cal.,
96 F.2d 239, 242.
A term specifically applied to a written instru-
ment whereby banker having advanced money for
purchase of imported merchandise and having
taken title in his own name, delivers possession
to importer on agreement in writing to hold mer-
chandise in trust for banker till he is paid. Si-
mons v. Northeastern Finance Corporation, 271
Mass. 285, 171 N.E. 643, 644.
Voluntary trust. An obligation arising out of
a personal confidence reposed in, and voluntarily
accepted by, one for the benefit of another, as dis-
tinguished from an "involuntary" trust, which is
created by operation of law. Civ.Code Cal. §§
2216, 2217. According to another use of the term,
"voluntary" trusts are such as are made in favor
of a volunteer, that is, a person who gives nothing
in exchange for the trust, but receives it as a
pure gift; and in this use the term is distinguished
from "trusts for value," the latter being such as
are in favor of purchasers, mortgagees, etc. A
"voluntary trust" is an equitable gift, and in or-
der to be enforceable by the beneficiaries must be
complete. Cameron v. Cameron, 96 Okl. 98, 220 P.
889, 890; Logan v. Ryan, 68 Cal.App. 448, 229 P.
993, 996.
The difference between a "gift inter vivos" and a "vol-
untary trust" is that, in a gift, the thing itself with title
passes to the donee, while, in a voluntary trust, the actual
title passes to a cestui que trust while the legal title is
retained by the settlor, to be held by him for the purposes
of the trust or is by the settlor transferred to another to
hold for the purposes of the trust. Allen v. Hendrick, 104
Or. 202, 206 P. 733, 740.
Voting trust. See that title.
2. Constitutional and Statutory Law
An association or organization of persons or cor-
porations having the intention and power, or the
tendency, to create a monopoly, control produc-
tion, interfere with the free course of trade or
transportation, or to fix and regulate the supply
and the price of commodities.
was originally a device by which several corporations en-
gaged in the same general line of business might combine
for their mutual advantage, in the direction of eliminating
destructive competition, controlling the output of their
commodity, and regulating and maintaining its price, but
at the same time preserving their separate individual
existence, and without any consolidation or merger. This
device was the erection of a central committee or board,
composed, perhaps, of the presidents or general managers
of the different corporations, and the transfer to them of a
majority of the stock in each of the corporations, to be
held "in trust" for the several stockholders so assigning
their holdings. These stockholders received in return
"trust certificates" showing that they were entitled to re-
ceive the dividends on their assigned stock, though the
voting power of it had passed to the trustees. This last
feature enabled the trustees or committee to elect all the
directors of all the corporations, and through them the
officers, and thereby to exercise an absolutely controlling
influence over the policy and operations of each constituent
company, to the ends and with the purposes above men-
tioned. Though the "trust," in this sense, is now seldom
if ever resorted to as a form of corporate organization,
having given place to the "holding corporation" and other
devices, the word has become current in statute laws as
well as popular speech, to designate almost any form of
combination of a monopolistic character or tendency. See
Black, Const. Law (3d Ed.) p. 428; Northern Securities Co.
v. U. S., 193 U.S. 197, 24 Sup.Ct. 436, 48 L.Ed. 679; Mac-
Ginniss v. Mining Co., 29 Mont. 428, 75 P. 89; Georgia
Fruit Exchange v. Turnipseed, 9 Ala.App. 123, 62 So. 542,
546; Mallinckrodt Chemical Works v. State of Missouri, 35
S.Ct. 671, 673, 238 U.S. 41, 59 L.Ed. 1192.
In a looser sense the term "trust" is applied to
any combination of establishments in the same
line of business for securing the same ends by
holding the individual interests of each subservient
to a common authority for the common interests
of all. Mallinckrodt Chemical Works v. State of
Missouri, 35 S.Ct. 671, 673, 238 U.S. 41, 59 L.Ed.
TRUST ESTATES AS BUSINESS COMPANIES.
A practice originating in Massachusetts of vesting
a business or certain real estate in a group of
trustees, who manage it for the benefit of the
beneficial owners; the ownership of the latter is
evidenced by negotiable (or transferable) shares.
The trustees are elected by the shareholders, or, in
case of a vacancy, by the board of trustees. Pro-
vision is made in the agreement and declaration
of trust to the effect that when new trustees are
elected, the trust estate shall vest in them with-
out further conveyance. The declaration of trust
specifies the powers of the trustees. They have
a common seal; the board is organized with the
usual officers of a board of trustees; it is governed
by by-laws; the officers have the usual powers of
like corporate officers; so far as practicable, the
trustees in their collective capacity, are to carry
on the business under a specified name. The
trustees may also hold shares as beneficiaries.
Provision may be made for the alteration or
amendment of the agreement or declaration in a
specified manner. In Eliot v. Freeman, 31 Sup.Ct.
360, 220 U.S. 178, 55 L.Ed. 424, it was held that
such a trust was not within the corporation tax
provisions of the tariff act of Aug. 5, 1909. See
also Zonne v. Minneapolis Syndicate, 31 S.Ct. 361,
220 U.S. 187, 55 L.Ed. 428.

## TRUSTEE

The person appointed, or required by
law, to execute a trust; one in whom an estate,
interest, or power is vested, under an express or
for the benefit or to the use of another called
the cestui que trust. Pioneer Mining Co. v. Ty-
berg, C.C.A.Alaska, 215 F. 501, 506, L.R.A.1915B,
442; Kaehn v. St. Paul Co-op. Ass'n, 156 Minn. 113,
194 N.W. 112; Catlett v. Hawthorne, 157 Va. 372,
161 S.E. 47, 48. Person who holds title to res
and administers it for others' benefit. Reinecke v.
Smith, Ill., 53 S.Ct. 570, 289 U.S. 172, 77 L.Ed. 1109.
In a strict sense, a "trustee" is one'who holds the legal
title to property for the benefit of another, while, in a
broad sense, the term is sometimes applied to anyone
standing In a fiduciary or confidential relation to another,
such as agent, attorney, bailee, etc. State ex rel. Lee v.
Sartorius, 344 Mo. 912, 130 S.W.2d 547, 549, 550.
"Trustee" is also used in a wide and perhaps inaccurate
sense, to denote that a person has the duty of carrying out
a transaction, in which he and another person are interest-
ed, in such manner as will be most for the benefit of the
latter, and not in such a way that he himself might be
tempted, for the sake of his personal advantage, to neg-
lect the interests of the other. In this sense, directors of
companies are said to be "trustees for the shareholders."

## TURNTABLE DOCTRINE

Also termed attrac-

ous instrumentalities in an exposed and unguarded
condition, and where injuries have been received
by a child so enticed the entry is not regarded as
unlawful, and does not necessarily preclude a re-
covery of damages; the attractiveness of the
machine or structure amounting to an implied
invitation to enter. Heller v. New York N. H. &
H. R. Co., C.C.A.N.Y., 265 F. 192, 194. It imposes
a liability on a property owner for injuries to a
child of tender years, resulting from something
on his premises that can be operated by such a
child and made dangerous by him, and which
is attractive to him and calculated to induce him
to use it, where he fails to protect the thing so
that a child of tender years cannot be hurt by it.
Barnhill's Adm'r v. Mt. Morgan Coal Co., D.C.
Ky., 215 F. 608, 609.
Doctrine is that who maintains or creates upon his
premises or upon the premises of another in any public
place an instrumentality or condition which may reason-
ably be expected to attract children of tender years and
to constitute a danger to them is under duty to take the
precautions that a reasonably prudent person would take
under similar circumstance, to prevent injury to such
children. Schock v. Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey
Combined Shows, 5 Wash.2d 599, 105 P.2d 838, 843.
The dangerous and alluring qualities of a railroad turn-
table gave the "attractive nuisance rule" the name of

tous contract.

## TURPIS EST PARS QUIE NON CONVENIT CUM SUO TOTO

no consideration.] Plowd. 101; Shep. Touch. 87.

## TURPITUDE

In its ordinary sense, inherent
baseness or vileness of principle or action; shame-
ful wickedness; depravity. In its legal sense,
everything done contrary to justice, honesty,
modesty, or good morals. State v. Anderson, 117
Kan. 117, 230 P. 315, 317; Hughes v. State Board
of Medical Examiners, 162 Ga. 246, 134 S.E. 42,
46. An action showing gross depravity. Traders
& General Ins. Co. v. Russell, Tex.Civ.App., 99
S.W.2d 1079, 1084.
Moral Turpitude
A term of frequent occurrence in statutes, espe-
cially those providing that a witness' conviction of
a crime involving moral turpitude may be shown
it means neither more nor less than "turpitude,"
i. e., anything done contrary to justice, honesty,
modesty, or good morals. In re Williams, 64 Okl.
316, 167 P. 1149, 1152; In re Humphrey, 174 Cal.
290, 163 P. 60, 62. Indeed, it is sometimes can-
didly admitted that the word "moral" in this
phrase does not add anything to the meaning of
the term other than that emphasis which may
result from a tautological expression. Hughes
v. State Board of Medical Examiners, 162 Ga. 246,
134 S.E. 42, 46. It is also commonly defined as
an act of baseness, vileness, or depravity in the
private and social duties which a man owes to his
fellow man or to society in general, contrary to
the accepted and customary rule of right and duty
between man and man. Moore v. State, 12 Ala.
App. 243, 67 So. 789, 791; United States v. Uhl,
C.C.A.N.Y., 210 F. 860, 862.
Although a vague term, it implies something immoral in
itself, regardless of its being punishable by law. Pippin
v. State, 197 Ala. 613, 73 So. 340, 342; Coykendall v.
Skrmetta, C.C.A.Ga., 22 F.2d 120; Thus excluding unin-
tentional wrong, or an improper act done without unlaw-
ful or improper intent. Drazen v. New Haven Taxicab
'Co., 95 Conn. 500, 111 A., 861, 863. It is also said to be re-
stricted to the gravest offenses, consisting of felonies, in-
famous crimes, and those that are malum in se and dis-
close a depraved mind. Bartos v. United States District
-Court for District of Nebraska, C.C.A.Neb., 19 F.2d 722,
TURPITUDO. Lat. Baseness; infamy; immo-
rality; turpitude.

ian appointed for an infant under guardianship.

is always safer to err in acquitting than punish-
ing, on the side of mercy than on the side of jus-
tice. Branch, Princ.; 2 Hale, P. C. 290; Broom,
Max. 326; Corn. v. York, 9 Mete. (Mass.) 116, 43

structor. State ex rel. Veeder v. State Board of
Education, 97 Mont. 121, 33 P.2d 516, 522.
In the civil law. This term corresponds nearly
to "guardian," (i. e., a person appointed to have
the care of the person of a minor and the adminis-
tration of his estate,) except that the guardian
of a minor who has passed a certain age is called
"curator," and has powers and duties differing
somewhat from those of a tutor. See Washington

take care of himself.
There are four sorts of tutorships: Tutorship by nature;
tutorship by will; tutorship by the effect of the law; tu-
torship by the appointment of the judge. Civ.Code La. art.

## TUTORSHIP BY NATURE

Upon the death of ei-
ther parent, the tutorship of minor children be-
longs of right to the other. Upon divorce or judi-
cial separation from bed and board of parents, the
tutorship of each minor child belongs of right to
the parent under whose care he or she has been
placed or to whose care he or she has been en-
trusted. All those cases are called tutorship by
TUTORSHIP BY WILL. The right of appointing
a tutor, whether a relation or a stranger, belongs
exclusively to the father or mother dying last.
This is called "tutorship by will," because general-
ly it is given by testament; but it may likewise be
given by any declaration by the surviving father
or mother, executed before a notary and two wit.
nesses. Civ.Code La. art. 257.

## TUTRIX

## TWA NIGHT GEST

In Saxon law. A guest on
the second night. By the laws of Edward the Con-
fessor it was provided that a man who lodged at
an inn, or at the house of another, should be con-
sidered, on the first night of his being there, a
stranger, (uncuth;) on the second night, a guest;
on the third night, a member of the family. This
had reference to the responsibility of the host or
entertainer for offenses committed by the guest.

## TWELVE TABLES

The earliest statute or code
of Roman law, framed by a commission of ten
men, B.C. 450, upon the return of a commission of
three who had been sent abroad to study foreign
laws and institutions. The Twelve Tables consist-
ed partly of laws transcribed from the institutions
of other nations, partly of such as were altered
and accommodated to the manners of the Romans,
partly of new provisions, and mainly, perhaps,
of laws and usages under their ancient kings.
They formed the source and foundation for the
whole later development of Roman jurisprudence.
They exist now only in fragmentary form. See 1
Kent, Comm. 520. These laws were substantiall
a codification, and not merely an incorporation,
of the customary law of the people. There were
Greek elements in them, but still they were es
sentially Roman. Hunter, Rom.L. 16. See Steph-
enson, Hist.Rom.L. 120; Sohm's Inst.Rom.L.
