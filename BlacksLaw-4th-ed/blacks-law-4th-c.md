## CALVO DOCTRINE

The doctrine stated by the
Argentine jurist, Carlos Calvo, that a government
is not bound to indemnify aliens for losses or in-
juries sustained by them in consequence of domes-
tic disturbances or civil war, where the state is
not at fault, and that therefore foreign states are
not justified in intervening, by force or otherwise,
to secure the settlement of claims of their citizens
on account of such losses or injuries. Such inter-
vention, Calvo says, is not in accordance with the
practice of European States towards one another,
and is contrary to the principle of state sovereign-
ty. 3 Calvo §§ 1280, 1297. The Calvo Doctrine is
to be distinguished from the Drago Doctrine (q.
v.).

There are three degrees of care which are frequently rec-
ognized, corresponding (inversely) to the three degrees of
negligence, viz. : slight care, ordinary care, and great
care.
Slight care is such as persons of ordinary prudence usu-
ally exercise about their own affairs of slight importance.
25 Okl.St.Ann. § 4. Or it is that degree of care which a
person exercises about his own concerns, though he may be
a person of less than common prudence or of careless and
inattentive disposition. Litchfield v. White, 7 N.Y. 442,
57 Am.Dec. 534; Bank v. Guilmartin, 93 Ga. 503, 21 S.E.
55, 44 Arn.St.Rep. 182.
Ordinary care is that degree of care which persons of
ordinary care and prudence are accustomed to use and em-
ploy, under the same or similar circumstances. Gunn v.
Railroad Co., 36 W.Va. 165, 14 S.E. 465, 32 Am.St.Rep.
842; Railroad Co. v. Howard, 79 Ga. 44, 3 S.E. 426; Liston
v. Reynolds, 69 Mont. 480, 223 P. 507, 509; Pauls Valley
Compress & Storage Co. v. Harris, 62 Okl. 103, 162 P. 216,
218. Or it is that degree of care which may reasonably be
expected from a person in the party's situation, that is,
reasonable care. Neal v. Gillett, 1855, 23 Conn. 443.
Reasonable care is such a degree of care, precaution, or
diligence as may fairly and properly be expected or re-
quired, having regard to the nature of the action, or of
the subject-matter, and the circumstances surrounding the
transaction. See Johnson v. Hudson River R. Co., 6 Duer,
N.Y., 646; Appel v. Eaton & Price Co., 97 Mo.App. 428, 71
S.W. 741; Illinois Cent. R. Co. v. Noble, 142 Ill. 578, 32 N.
E. 684. It is such care as an ordinarily prudent person
would exercise under the conditions existing at the time
he is called upon to act. Midland Valley R. Co. v. Bell,
C.C.A.Okl., 242 F. 803, 808; Loverage v. Carmichael, 164
Minn. 76, 204 N.W. 921, 922. Substantially synonymous
with ordinary or due care. Kucera v. Grigsby, 24 Ohio
Vt. 504, 86 A. 808, 811.
Great care is such as persons of ordinary prudence usu-
ally exercise about affairs of their own which are of great
importance; or it is that degree of care usually bestowed
upon the matter in hand by the most competent, prudent,
and careful persons having to do with the particular sub-
ject. Railway Co. v. Smith, 87 Tex. 348, 28 S.W. 520;
Telegraph Co. v. Cook, Cal., 61 F. 628, 9 C.C.A. 680.
A high degree of care is not the legal equivalent of rea-
sonable care. Gallatty v. Central R. of New Jersey, 86
N.J.Law, 416, 92 A. 279, 280. It is that degree of care
which a very cautious, careful, and prudent person would
exercise under the same or similar circumstances. Bryn-
ing v. Missouri, K. & T. Ry. Co. of Texas, Tex.Civ.App.,
167 S.W. 826, 827; a degree of care commensurate with
the risk of danger. New Jersey Fidelity & Plate Glass Ins.
Co. v. Lehigh Va:ley R. Co., 92 N.J.Law, 467, 105 A. 206,
Highest degree of care and utmost degree of care have
substantially the same meaning. Brogan v. Union Traction
Co., 76 W.Va. 698, 86 S.E. 753, 756. "Highest degree of
care" only requires the care and skill exacted of persons
engaged in the same or similar business. Birmingham Ry..,
Light & Power Co. v. Cockrell, 10 Ala.App. 578, 65 So. 704.
It means the highest degree required by law where human
safety is at stake, and the highest degree known to the
usage and practice of very careful, skillful, and diligent
persons engaged in the same business by similar means or
agencies. Birmingham Ry., Light & Power Co. v. Barrett,
179 Ala. 274, 60 So. 262, 264.
This division into three degrees of care, however, does
not command universal assent. Raymond v. Portland R.
Co., 100 Me. 529, 62 A. 602, 605, 3 L.R.A.,N.S., 94; Porn-
roy v. Bangor & Aroostook R. Co., 102 Me. 497, 67 A. 561,
CARELESS. Synonymous with "negligent," the
latter being probably the better word in pleadings.
Delmore v. Kansas City Hardwood Flooring Co.,
90 Kan. 29, 133 P. 151, 47 L.R.A.,N.S., 1220. Ab-
sence of ordinary or proper care, Pelfrey v. Com-
monwealth, 247 Ky. 484, 57 S.W.2d 474. Reckless,
Stout v. Gallemore, 138 Kan. 385, 26 P.2d 573, 577.

have a varying meaning. Pennsylvania Sugar Co. v.
Czarnikow-Rionda Co., C.C.A.Pa., 245 F. 913, 915. The
term may be applied in such a sense as to include passen-
gers, as well as freight, but in a technical sense it desig-
nates goods only. Wolcott v. Eagle Ins. Co., 4 Pick.,
Mass., 429. Thus, we say, A cargo of emigrants. See 7 M.

tested before a court of justice; an aggregate of
facts which furnishes occasion for the exercise of
the jurisdiction of a court of justice. Quoted with
approval in Kelly v. Roetzel, 64 Okl. 36, 165 P.
1150, 1153. See, also, Gebhard v. Sattler, 40 Iowa,
156; Martin v. Hunter, 1 Wheat. 352, 4 L.Ed. 97.

of litigants brought before the court for adjudication by
regular proceedings established for the protection or en-
forcement of rights, or the prevention, redress, or punish-

be satisfactorily decided, determined upon full argument
before the court in Banc. This is otherwise called a "spe-
cial case ;" and it is usual for the parties, where the law of
the case is doubtful, to agree that the jury shall find a
general verdict for the plaintiff, subject to the opinion of
the court upon such a case to be made, instead of obtain-
ing from the jury a special verdict. 3 Bl.Comm. 378; 3

,
Statute permitting an award to be set aside for "cause"
means for good cause or some such cause as fraud or sur-
prise, Elsenpeter v. Potvin, 213 Minn. 129, 5 N.W.2d 499,
In Civil and Scotch Law
The consideration of a contract, that is, the
inducement to it, or motive of the contracting
party for entering into it. Dig. 2, 14, 7; Toullier,
liv. 3, tit. 3, c. 2, § 4; 1 Abb. 28; Bell, Dict.
The civilians use the term "cause," in relation to obliga-
tions, in the same sense as the word "consideration" is
used in the jurisprudence of England and the United
States. It means the motive, the inducement to the agree-
ment,-id quod inducet ad contrahendum. Mouton v. No-
ble, 1 La. Ann. 192. But see Ames, 3 Sel.Essays in Anglo-
Amer.Leg.Hist. 279; Poll.Contr. 74.
Used also in the civil law in the sense of res
(a thing). Non porcellum, non agnellum nec alia
causa (not a hog, not a lamb, nor other thing).
Du Cange.
In Pleading
Reason; motive; matter of excuse or justifica-
tion. See S Co. 67; 11 East 451; 1 Chit.Pl. 585.
A suit, litigation, or action. Any question, civil
or criminal, litigated or contested before a court
of justice.
As used in venue statute, "cause" means "cause of ac-
tion", which means the right which a party has to institute
a judicial proceeding. Bergin v. Temple, 111 Mont. 539,
111 P.2d 286, 289, 133 A.L.R. 1115.
Cause imports a judicial proceeding entire, and is nearly
synonymous with lis in Latin, or suit in English. "Case"
not infrequently has a more limited signification, import-
ing a collection of facts, with the conclusion of law there-
on. See Shirts v. Irons, 47 Ind. 445; Erwin v. U. S., D.C.
Ga., 37 Fed. 470, 2 L.R.A. 229. But "cause" and "case"
are often synonymous. Zilz v. Wilcox, 190 Mich. 486, 157
N.W. 77, 80; Schmalz v. Arnwine, 118 Or.,300. 246 P. 718,
719; Cheney v. Richards, 130 Me. 288, 155 A. 642, 644.
A distinction is sometimes taken between "cause" and
"action." Burrill observes that a cause is not, like an ac-
tion or suit, said to be commenced, nor is an action, like
a cause, said to be tried. But, if there is any substantial
difference between these terms, it must lie in the fact that
"action" refers more peculiarly to the legal procedure of a
controversy ; "cause" to its merits or the state of facts
involved. Thus, we cannot say "the cause should have
been replevin." Nor would it be correct to say "the plain-
tiff pleaded his own action."
As to "Probable Cause" and "Proximate Cause,"
see those titles. As to challenge "for cause," see
"Challenge."

## CAUSE-BOOKS

Books kept in the central office
of the English supreme court, in which are en-
tered all writs of summons issued in the office.
Rules of Court, v 8.

## CAUSE LIST

In English practice. A printed
roll of actions, to be tried in the order of their en-
try, with the names of the solicitors for each liti-
gant. Similar to the calendar of causes, or dock-
et, used in American courts.

It may sometimes mean a person having a right of ac-

and she and her husband bring an action to recover it,
she is called in the old books the "meritorious cause of
action." 1 H.B1. 108.
A distinction may be taken between "cause of action"
and "right of action." Elliott v. Chicago, M. & St. P. Ry.
Co., 35 S.D. 57, 150 N.W. 777, 779. The cause of action
is distinct .from the "remedy." Tonn v. Inner Shoe Tire
Co., Tex.Civ.App., 260 S.W. 1078, 1080. And the cause of
action may exist, though the remedy does not. Chandler
v. Horne, 23 Ohio App. 1, 154 N.E. 748, 750.
Cause of action is not synonymous with chose in action.
Bank of Commerce v. Rutland & W. R. Co., 10 How.Prac.,
is the recovery of money or other personal property, the
cause of action is designated a "thing in action." State v.
District Court of Tenth Judicial Dist. in and for Fergus
County, 74 Mont. 355, 240 P. 667, 669.

## CAUSE OF INJURY

That which actually pro-
duces it, Anderson v. Byrd, 133 Neb. 483, 275 N.
W. 825, 826.

## CAUSE SUIT TO BE BROUGHT

begin, State v. Osen, 67 N.D. 436, 272 N.W. 783,
CAUSES CELEBRES. Celebrated cases. A work

importance in French courts in the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries.
Secondarily a single trial or decision is often called a
"cause celébre," when it is remarkable on account of the
parties involved or the unusual, interesting, or sensational
character of the facts.

## CAUSEWAY

A raised roadbed through low
lands; it differs from a levee. Board of Sup'rs of
Quitman County v. Carrier Lumber & Mfg. Co.,

bonds or pledges entered into by third parties.
Du Cange.

## CAUTIO MUCIANA

Security given by an heir or
legatee, to obtain immediate possession of inher-
itance or legacy, for observance of a condition an-
nexed to the bequest, where the act which is the
object of the condition is one which he must avoid

will never marry, never leave the country, never
engage in a particular trade, etc. See Mackeld.
Rom.Law, § 705.

## CAUTIO PIGNORATITIA

other.

## CAUTIONARY JUDGMENT

Where an action in
tort was pending and the plaintiff feared the de-
fendant would dispose of his real property be-
fore judgment, a cautionary judgment was en-
tered with a lien on the property; Seisner v.
Blake, 13 Pa.Co.Ct.R. 333; so in an action on a
note against a religious association, where it was
alleged that the defendant was endeavoring to
sell its real estate before judgment on the note;
Witmer & Dundore v. Port Treverton Church, 17
Pa.Co.Ct.R. 38.

## CAUTIONE ADMITTENDA

In English ecclesias-
tical law. A writ that lies against a bishop who
holds an excommunicated person in prison for

The terms "cautious" and "prudent" may be used inter-
changeably in defining negligence. Malcolm v. Mooresville
Cotton Mills, 191 N.C. 727, 133 S.E. 7, 9. But "cautious"
differs from "prudent" in suggesting the idea of timidity,
with its secondary meaning as overprudent; fearful. Peo-
ple v. Anderson, 58 Cal.App. 267, 208 P. 324, 325. See
Prudence.

## CAVEAT

formal notice or warning given by a party interested to a
court, judge, or ministerial officer against the performance
of certain acts within his power and jurisdiction. This

porarily or provisionally) the proving of a will or the
grant of administration, or to arrest the enrollment of a
decree in chancery when the party intends to take an ap-
peal, to prevent the grant of letters patent, etc. It is also
cess, to stay the granting of a patent for lands. Ex parte
Crafts, 28 S.C. 281, 5 S.E. 718; In re McCahan's Estate,
221 Pa. 188, 70 A. 711; See, also, 1 Burn, Eccl.Law 19,

patent-office, requiring them to refuse letters patent on a
particular invention or device to any other person, until

may be readily understood by the pleader on the other
side, as well as by the court and jury. State v. Burke, 151
Mo. 143, 52 S. W. 226.
This word is technically used in pleading In two different
senses, signifying either distinctness, or particularity, as
opposed to undue generality.
Certainty is said to be of three sorts : (1) Certainty to a
common intent is such as is attained by using words in
their ordinary meaning, but is not exclusive of another
ference. See 2 H.Bla. 530; Andr.Steph.Pl. 384. (2) Cer-
tainty to a certain intent in general is that which allows
of no misunderstanding if a fair and reasonable construc-
tion is put upon the language employed, without bringing
in facts which are possible, but not apparent. 1 Wms.
Saund. 49; Fuller v. Hampton, 5 Conn. 423. (3) Certainty
to a certain intent in particular is the highest degree of
technical accuracy and precision. Co.Litt. 303; 2 H.B1.
530; State v. Parker, 34 Ark. 158, 36 Am.Rep. 5; Lawes,
Pl. 54. These definitions, which have been adopted from
Coke, have been subjected to severe criticism, but are of
some utility in drawing attention to the different degrees
of exactness and fulness of statement required in different
instances. 13 East, 112; 3 Maule & S. 14; People v. Dun-
lap, 13 Johns., N.Y., 437.

Van Schaick v. Van Buren, 70 Hun, 575, 24 N.Y.S.
A thing is certain when its essence, quality, and quantity
are described, distinctly set forth, etc. Dig. 12, 1, 6. It is
uncertain when the description is not that of an individual
object, but designates only the kind. Civ.Code La. art.
3556, par. 7; 5 Coke, 121.
In Determining Negotiability of Instrument

2d 648, 650,

CHARTA.
In Old English Law
A charter or deed; an instrument written and
sealed; the formal evidence of conveyances and
contracts. Also any signal or token by which an
estate was held.
The term came to be applied, by way of eminence, to
such documents as proceeded from the sovereign, granting
liberties or privileges, and either where the recipient of
the grant was the whole nation, as in the case of Magna
Charta, or a public body, or private individual, in which
case it corresponded to the modern word "charter."
In the Civil Law
Paper, suitable for the inscription of documents
or books; hence, any instrument or writing. See
Dig. 32, 52, 6; Nov. 44, 2.
Charta Communis
In old English law. An indenture; a common or mutual
charter or deed; one containing mutual covenants, or
involving mutuality of obligation; one to which both par-
ties might have occasion to refer, to establish their respec-
tive rights. Bract. fols. 33b, 34.
Charta Cyrographata (or Chyrographata)
In old English law. A chirographed charter; a charter
executed in two parts, and cut through the middle, (scin-
ditur per medium,) where the word "cyrographum," or
"chirographum," was written in large letters. Bract fol.
34; Fleta, lib. 3, c. 14, § 3. See Chirograph.
Charta De Foresta
A collection of the laws of the forest, made in the 9th
Hen. III, and said to have been originally a part of Magna
Charta.
The charta de foresta was called the Great Charter of the
woodland population, nobles, barons, freemen, and slaves,
loyally granted by Henry III. early in his reign (A.D.1217).
Inderwick, King's Peace 159; Stubb's Charters 847. There
is a difference of opinion as to the original charter of the
forest similar to that which exists respecting the true and
original Magna Carta (q. v.), and for the same reason, viz.,
that both required repeated confirmation by the kings,
despite their supposed inviolability. This justifies the
remark of recent historians as to the great charter that
Shared with 'the Great Charter. of Liberties' by the Char-
ter of the Forest which was issued in 1217." 1 Poll. &
Maitl. 158. It is asserted with great positiveness by Inder-
wick that no forest charter was ever granted by King
John, but that Henry III. issued the charter of 1217 (which
he puts in the third year of the reign, which, however, only
commenced Oct. 28, 1216), in pursuance of the promises of
his father; and Lord Coke, referring to it as a charter on
which the lives and liberties of the woodland population
depended, says that it was confirmed at least thirty times
between the death of John and that of Henry V. ; 4
Co. Inst. 303.
Webster, under the title Magna Charta, says that the
name is applied to the charter granted in the 9th Hen.

## III

and confirmed by Edw. I. Prof. Maitland, in speaking
of Magna Carta, refers to "the sister-charter which defined
the forest law" as one of the four documents which, at the
death of Henry III., comprised the written law of England.
1 Soc. England 410. Edward I. in 1297 confirmed "the
charter made by the common consent of all the realm in
the time of Henry III. to be kept in every point without
breach." Inderwick, King's Peace 160; Stubb's Charters
486. The Century Dictionary refers to this latter charter
of Edw. I. as the Charter of .the Forest; but it was, as
already shown, only a confirmation of it, and a comparison
of the authorities leaves little if any doubt that the date
was as above stated and the history as here given. Its
provisions may be found in Stubb's Charters and they are
summarized by Inderwick, in his work above cited.

State, 92 Ind.App. 150, 168 N.E. 202, 203. It nec-
essarily implies a fraudulent intent. Clolinger v.
Callahan, 204 Ky. 33, 263 S.W. 700, 702.
The words "cheat and defraud" usually mean to induce
a person to part with the possession of property by reason
of intentionally false representations relied and acted upon

Conn. 807, 120 A. 681, 682; They include not only the crime

## CHEAT

Swindling; defrauding. "Deceitful
practices in defrauding or endeavoring to defraud
another of his known right, by some willful device,
contrary to the plain rules of common honesty."
Hawk.P.C. b. 2, c. 23, § 1. "The fraudulent obtain-
ing the property of another by any deceitful and
illegal practice or token (short of felony) which
affects or may affect the public." Steph.Crim.
Law, 93.
Cheats, punishable at common law, are such
cheats (not amounting to felony) as are effected
by deceitful or illegal symbols or tokens which
may affect the public at large, and against which
common prudence could not have guarded. 2
Whart.Crim.Law, § 1116; 2 East, P.C. 818; Von
Mumm v. Frash, C.C.N.Y., 56 F. 836; State v.
Parker, 43 N.H. 85.
CHEATERS, or ESCHEATORS, were officers ap-
pointed to look after the king's escheats, a duty
which gave them great opportunities of fraud and
oppression, and in consequence many complaints
were made of their misconduct. Hence it seems
that a cheater came to signify a fraudulent per-
son, and thence the verb to cheat was derived.
Wharton.

the hand and seal of the Chancellor of the Exche-
quer. May, Parl.Pr. 642.
The stewardship of the Chiltern Hundreds is a nominal
office in the gift of the crown, usually accepted by mem-
bers of the house of commons desirous of vacating their
seats. By law a member once duly elected to parliament is
compelled to discharge the duties of the trust conferred
upon him, and is not enabled at will to resign it. But by
statute, if any member accepts any office of profit from the
crown, (except officers in the army or navy accepting a new
commission,) his seat is vacated. If, therefore, any mem-
ber wishes to retire from the representation of the county
or borough by which he was sent to parliament, he applies
to the lords of the treasury for the stewardship of one of
the Chiltern Hundreds, which having received, and thereby
accomplished his purpose, he again resigns the office.

ORIATUR. 5 Coke, 31. Circuity is to be avoided;
and it is the duty of a good judge to determine
litigations, lest one lawsuit arise out of another.

15 Am.Dec. 412.

## CIRCULATED

A thing is "circulated" when it

Tex.Cr.R. 384, 87 S.W.2d 269, 270.

## CIRCULATION

As used in statutes providing

ey. U. S. v. Wilson, 106 U.S. 620, 2 S.Ct. 85, 27 L.

## CIRCUMSTANCES

Attendant facts. Pope v.
Reading Co., 304 Pa. 326, 156 A. 106, 109. The
surroundings at the commission of an act.
The terms "circumstance" and "fact" are, in many ap-
plications, synonymous; but the true distinction of a
circumstance is its relative character. "Any fact may be
a circumstance with reference to any other fact." 1 Benth.
Jud.Evid. 42, note; Id. 142. "Circumstances" are minor
facts, Pulliam v. State, 196 Ga. 782, 28 S.E.2d 139, 147;
related or accessory facts, occurrences or things which
stand around, or about, which attend upon, which closely
precede or follow, which surround , and accompany, which
depend upon, or which support or qualify a principal fact
or event, Salter v. State, 163 Ga. 80, 135 S.E. 408, 409.
As used in a statute for an allowance for the wife in
a divorce action, having regard to the "circumstances" of
the parties, it includes practically everything which has a
legitimate bearing on present and prospective matters re-
lating to the lives of both parties. Lamborn v. Lamborn,
80 Cal. App. 494, 251 P. 943, 945.
The "circumstances of the transaction itself," as used in
the doctrine of dying declarations, are the circumstances
or facts leading up to, causing, or attending the homicide,
and are not confined to occurrences at the very time there-
of. Pendleton v. Commonwealth, 131 Va. 676, 109 S.E. 201,
Thrift, integrity, good repute, business capacity, and
stability of character, for example, are "circumstances"
which may be very properly considered in determining the
question of "adequate security." Martin v. Duke, 5 Rea.
Sur. (N.Y.) 600.

## CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE

The term in-
cludes all evidence of indirect nature. Milligan v.
State, 109 Fla. 219, 147 So. 260, 263.
It is direct evidence as to facts deposed to but indirect as
to the factum probandum, Brown v. State, 126 Tex.Cr.R.
449, 72 S.W.2d 269, 270; evidence of facts or circumstances
from which the existence or nonexistence of fact in issue
may be inferred. People v. Steele, 37 N.Y.S.2d 199, 200,
179 Misc. 587; Wolff v. Employers Fire Ins. Co., 282 Ky.
824, 140 S.W.2d 640, 645, 130 A.L.R. 682; Scott v. State,
57 Ga.App. 489, 195 S.E. 923, 924; inferences drawn from
facts proved, Hatfield v. Levy Bros., 18 Ca1.2d 798, 117 P.
2d 841, 845; preponderance of probabilities, Hercules Pow-
der Co., v. Nieratko, 113 N.J.L. 188, 173 A. 606, 610; pro-
cess of decision by which court or jury may reason from
circumstances known or proved, to establish by inference
the principal fact, People v. Taddio, 292 N.Y. 488, 55 N.E.
2d 749, 750.
It means that existence of principal facts is only inferred
from circumstances. Twin City Fire Ins. Co. v. Lonas, 255
Ky. 717, 75 S.W.2d 348, 350.
When the existence of the principal fact is deduced from
evidentiary by a process of probable reasoning, the evi-
dence and proof are said to be presumptive. Best, Pres.
246; Id. 12. All presumptive evidence is circumstantial be-
cause necessarily derived from or made up of circum-
stances, but all circumstantial evidence is not presumptive.
Burrill.
The proof of various facts or circumstances which usual-
ly attend the main fact in dispute, and therefore tend to
prove its existence, or to sustain, by their consistency, the
hypothesis claimed. Or as otherwise defined, it consists in
reasoning from facts which are known or proved to es-
tablish such as are conjectured to exist.

Co., Tex.Civ.App., 114 S.W.2d 1228, 1239. The act
by which a person is so summoned or cited.
It is usually original process in any proceeding where
used, and in such respect is analogous to a writ of capias
or summons at law and subpcena in chancery. Gondas v.
Gondas, 99 N.J.Eq. 473, 134 A. 615, 618.
As the act of the court through its proper officer com-
manding the appearance of defendant at the time and place
named to answer to plaintiff's petition, it has the dignity of
official character and weight of superior authority. Mor-
an Oil & Gas Co. v. Anderson, Tex.Civ.App., 223 S.W. 1031,
1032. It is used in this sense, in American law, in the
practice upon writs of error from the United States su-
preme court, and in the proceedings of courts of probate
in many of• the states. Durfee v. Durfee, 293 Mass. 472,
200 N.E. 395, 397; Schwartz v. Lake, 109 La. 1081, 34 So.
It is also the name of the process used in the English ec-
clesiastical, probate, and divorce courts to call the defend-
ant or respondent before them. 3 B1.Comm. 100; 3 Steph.
Comm. 720. And in Scotch practice it is the calling of a
party to an action done by an officer of the court under
a proper warrant; the service of a writ or bill of sum-
mons. Paters. Comp.

In Roman law. An act of
Valentinian, passed A. D. 426, providing that the
writings of only five jurists, viz., Papinian, Paul,
Gaius, Ulpian, and Modestinus, should be quoted
as authorities. The majority was binding on the
judge. If they were equally divided the opinion
of Papinian was to prevail; and in such a case, if
Papinian was silent upon the matter, then the
judge was free to follow his own view of the mat-
ter. Brown.
CITATIONES NON CONCEDANTUR PRIUS-
QUAM EXPRIMATUR SUPER QUA RE FIERI

of conduct for the promotion of general welfare
and conservation of individual as well as collec-
tive rights. In re McIntosh, D.C.Wash., 12 F.
Supp. 177.
The term appears to have been used in the Roman gov-
ernment to designate a person who had the freedom of the
city, and the right to exercise all political and civil priv-
ileges of the government. There was also, at Rome, a
partial citizenship, including civil, but not political rights.

each in his own right, while in the latter all municipal
functions are performed by deputies; the one being direct,
the other representative. In re Opinion of the Justices,

law, to distinguish it from the "law of nature,"
and from international law. See Bowyer, Mod.

stitutes, Code, Digest, and Novels, and collectively denom-
inated the "Corpus Juris Civi/is,"—as distinguished from
the common law of England and the canon law.

It necessarily means a clear preponderance. It may
mean no more than a fair preponderance of proof but
may be construed as requiring a higher degree of proof.
It may convey the idea, under emphasis, of certainty. It
may be understood as meaning beyond doubt. The expres-
sion is equivocal and mischievous. Aubin v. Duluth St. Ry.

## COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

As contemplated
by National Labor Relations Act is a procedure
looking toward making of collective agreements
between employer arid accredited representatives
of employees concerning wages, hours, and other
conditions of employment, and requires that par-
ties deal with each other with open and fair minds
and sincerely endeavor to overcome obstacles exist-
ing between them to the end that employment re-
lations may be stabilized and obstruction to free
flow of commerce prevented. National Labor Re-
lations Act § 8(5), 29 U.S.C.A. § 158(5). Rapid
Roller Co. v. National Labor Relations Board,
C.C.A.7, 126 F.2d 452, 460.
The essence of "collective bargaining" is the freedom of
choice of employees in selection of their bargaining rep-
resentative. National Labor Relations Act § 1 et seq., 29
U.S.C.A. § 151 et seq. National Labor Relations Board v.
American Rolling Mill Co., C.C.A.6, 126 F.2d 38, 41.
"Collective bargaining," within provision of National
Labor Relations Act providing that a refusal to bargain
collectively should be an unfair labor practice, does not
require employer to reach an agreement, but does require
sincere negotiations with representatives of employees.
National Labor Relations Act § 8(5), 29 U.S.C.A. § 158(5).
National Labor Relations Board v. Biles Coleman Lumber
Co., C.C.A.9, 98 F.2d 18, 22.
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT.

COLLECTIVE LABOR AGREEMENT. Also called
"trade agreement". Bargaining agreement as to
wages and conditions of work entered into by
groups of employees, usually organized into a
brotherhood or union on one side and groups of

tration, and his duties cease as soon as an execu-
tor or administrator is qualified.

## COLLEGIUM

Lat. In the civil law. A word
having various meanings ; e. g., an assembly, so-

the same rank and station, or united for the pur-
suit of some business or enterprise. Sometimes, a

legium" (1 Bl.Comm. 469), though the more usual

Wis. 478, 17 N.W.2d 570, 571.
Maritime Law
The act of ships or vessels striking together.
In its strict sense, collision means the impact of two
vessels both moving, and is distinguished from allision,
which designates the striking of a moving vessel against
one that is stationary. But collision is used in a broad
sense, to include allision, and perhaps other species of
encounters between vessels, or a vessel and other floating,
though non-navigable, objects. Wright v. Brown, 4 Ind.

F.2d 736, 738, 43 A.L.R. 215.
The term is not inapplicable to cases where a stationary
vessel is struck by one under way, strictly termed "alli-
sion" ; or where one vessel is brought into contact with
another by swinging at anchor. And even an injury
received by a vessel at her moorings, in consequence of
being violently rubbed or pressed against by a second ves-
sel lying alongside of her, in consequence of a collision
against such second vessel by a third one under way, may
be compensated for, under the general head of "collision,"
as well as an injury which is the direct result of a "blow,"
properly so called. The Money, Abb.Adm. 73, Fed.Cas.No.
9,894.
Automobile Insurance Law
The term denotes the act of colliding; striking
together; violent contact. Long v. Royal ins.
Co., 180 Wash. 360, 40 P.2d 132, 133, 105 A.L.R.
1423. The term implies an impact or sudden con-
tact of a moving body with an obstruction in its
line of motion, whether both bodies are in motion
or one stationary and the other, no matter which,
in motion. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v.
American Compounding Co., 211 Ala. 593, 100 So.

poration, 48 N.M. 9, 144 P.2d 676, 678, 679, 681.
But liability depends on what the automobile collides
with and, of course, the cause of the collision and the
terms of the policy. Liability has been sustained where
collision was with embankment, Pred v. Employers' Indem-
nity Corporation, 112 Neb. 161, 198 N.W. 864, 866, 35
A.L.R. 1003; and also denied, Fox v. Interstate Exch., 182

where collision was with earth, after automobile had gone
over an embankment, Continental Casualty Co. v. Paul.
209 Ala. 166, 95 So. 814, 815, 30 A.L.R. 802 (contra Polstein

and with stump after skidding off the road, Ploe v. Inter-
national Indemnity Co., 128 Wash. 480, 223 P. 327, 328, 35
A.L.R. 999. Liability has been sustained for damages
caused by collision with sides of rut, Wood v. Southern
Casualty Co., Tex.Civ.App., 270 S.W. 1055, 1057; and both

## COLLUSIVE ACTION

An action not founded
upon an actual controversy between the parties to
it, but brought for purpose of securing a deter-
mination of a point of law for the gratification
of curiosity or to settle rights of third persons
not parties. It will not be entertained. City and
County of San Francisco v. Boyd, 22 Ca1.2d 685,
140 P.2d 666, 669, 670.

## COLONY

A dependent political community, con-
sisting of a number of citizens of the same country
who have emigrated therefrom to people another,
and remain subject to the mother-country. U. S.
v. The Nancy, 3 Wash.C.C. 287, Fed.Cas.No.15,854.
A settlement in a foreign country possessed
and cultivated, either wholly or partially, by im-
migrants and their descendants, who have a politi-
cal connection with and subordination to the moth-
er-country, whence they emigrated. In other
words, it is a place peopled from some more an-
cient city or country. Wharton.
In the English government, this is the depart-
ment of state through which the sovereign ap-

law in force in the thirteen original colonies be-
fore the Declaration of Independence. In Eng-
land, the term signifies the laws enacted by Cana-

## COLOR

An appearance, semblance, or simula-
crum, as distinguished from that which is real.
A prima facie or apparent right. Hence, a de-
ceptive appearance; a plausible, assumed exterior,
concealing a lack of reality; a disguise or pre-
text. Railroad Co. v. Allfree, 64 Iowa 500, 20 N.W.
779; Broughton v. Haywood, 61 N.C. 383; Wilt v.
Bueter, 186 Ind. 98, 111 N.E. 926, 929.
In pleading. Ground of action admitted to sub-
sist in the opposite party by the pleading of one of
the parties to an action, which is so set out as to
be apparently valid, but which is in reality legally
insufficient.
A term of the ancient rhetoricians, and early adopted
into the language of pleading. It was an apparent or prima
facie right; and the meaning of the rule that pleadings in
confession and avoidance should give color was that they
should confess the matter adversely alleged, to such an
extent, at least, as to admit some apparent right in the
opposite party, which required to be encountered and
avoided by the allegation of new matter. Color was either
express, i. e., inserted in the pleading, or implied, which
was naturally inherent in the structure of the pleading.
Steph.P1. 233; Merten v. Bank, 5 Okl. 585, 49 P. 913.
Wheeler v. Nickels, 168 Or. 604, 126 P.2d 32, 36.
The word also means the dark color of the skin
showing the presence of negro blood; and hence
it is equivalent to African descent or parentage.
Johnson v. Board of Education of Wilson County,
166 N.C. 468, 82 S.E. 832, 834, L.R.A.1915A, 828.

## COLOR OF AUTHORITY

That semblance or pre-
sumption of authority sustaining the acts of a pub-
lic officer which is derived from his apparent title
to the office or from a writ or other process in his
hands apparently valid and regular. State v.
Oates, 86 Wis. 634, 57 N.W. 296, 39 Am.St.Rep. 912.

## COLOR OF LAW

The appearance or semblance,
without the substance, of legal right. State v.
Brechler, 185 Wis. 599, 202 N.W. 144, 148.

## COLOR OF OFFICE

An act unjustly done by
the countenance of an office, being grounded upon
corruption, to which the office is as a shadow and
,
color. Plow. 64. Day v. National Bond & Invest-
ment Co., Mo.App., 99 S.W.2d 117, 119.
A claim or assumption of right to do an act by
virtue of an office, made by a person who is legally
destitute of any such right. Feller v. Gates, 40 Or.
543, 67 P. 416, 56 L.R.A. 630, 91 Am.St.Rep. 492;
Citizens' Bank of Colquitt v. American Surety
Co. of New York, 174 Ga. 852, 164 S.E. 817; Pon-
tiac Trust Co. v. Newell, 266 Mich. 490, 254 N.W.
178, 181.
Such person must be at least officer de factor. Burrall
v. Acker, 23 Wend., N.Y., 606, 35 Am.Dec. 582; Day v.
National Bond & Investment Co., Mo.App., 99 S.W.2d 117,
119. See, also, Colore Officii.

## COLOR OF TITLE

The appearance, semblance,
or simulacrum of title. Also termed "apparent
title." Any fact, extraneous to the act or mere
will of the claimant, which has the appearance, on
its face, of supporting his claim of a present title
to land, but which, for some defect, in reality falls
short of establishing it. Howth v. Farrar, C.C.A.
Tex., 94 F.2d 654, 658; Saltmarsh v. Crommelin,
24 Ala. 352.
, Anything in writing purporting to convey title to the
land, which defines the extent of the claim, it being imma-
terial how defective or imperfect the writing may be, so
that it is a sign, semblance, or color of title. Theisen v.
Qualley, 42 S.D. 367, 175 N.W. 556, 557. A title that is
imperfect, but not so obviously so that it would be appar-
ent to one not skilled in the law. Ipock v. Gaskins, 161
N.C. 673, 77 S.E. 843, 847.
A writing upon its face professing to pass title but which
does not, either through want of title in the grantor or a
defective mode of conveyance. Philbin v. Carr, 75 Ind.App.
560, 129 N.E. 19, 24; Glass v. Lynchburg Shoe Co., 212 N.C.
70, 192 S.E. 899.
That which the law considers prima facie a good title,
but which, by reason of some defect, not appearing on its
face, does not in fact amount to title. An absolute nullity,
as a void deed, judgment, etc., will not constitute color of
title. Causey v. White, 143 Ga. 7, 84 S.E. 58; Stearns Coal
& Lumber Co. v. Boyatt, 168 Ky. 111, 181 S. W. 962, 964.
That which is title in appearance but not in reality. Ffts-
chen Bros. Commercial Co. v. Noyes' Estate, 76 Mont. 175,
246 P. 773, 779; Boland v. Heck, 179 Okl. 403, 65 P.2d 1213,
"Any instrument having a grantor and grantee, and con-
taining a description of the lands intended to be conveyed,
and apt words for their conveyance, gives color of title to
the lands described. Such an instrument purports to be a
conveyance of the title, and because it does not, for some
reason, have that effect, it passes only color or the sem-
blance of a title." Brooks v. Bruyn, 35 Ill. 392.
"Color of title" is not synonymous with "claim of title."
To constitute "color of title" there must be a paper title
to give color to the adverse possession, whereas, a "claim
of title" may be shown wholly by parol. Walton v. Sikes,
165 Ga. 422, 141 S.E. 188, 190.

## COLORABLE

That which has or gives color.
That which is in appearance only, and not in reali-
ty, what it purports to be. Counterfeit, feigned,
having the appearance of truth. Ellis v. Jones, 73
Colo. 516, 216 P. 257, 258.

## COLORABLE ALTERATION

One which makes
no real or substantial change, but is introduced
only as a subterfuge or means of evading the pat-
ent or copyright law.

## COLORABLE CAUSE OR INVOCATION OF JU- RISDICTION

With reference to actions for ma-
licious prosecution, a "colorable cause or invoca-
tion of jurisdiction" means that a person, appar-
ently qualified, has appeared before a justice and
made a complaint under oath and in writing, stat-
ing some facts which in connection with other
facts constitute a criminal offense or bear a simili-
tude thereto. Hotel Supply Co. v. Reid, 16 Ala.
App. 563, 80 So. 137, 138.

## COLORABLE CLAIM

In bankruptcy law, a claim
made by one holding the property as an agent or
bailee of the bankrupt; a claim in which as a mat-
ter of law, there Is no adverseness. In re if tim,
C.C.A.Wis., 202 F. 883, 884; In re Western Rope
& Mfg. Co., C.C.A.Okl., 298 F. 926, 927.

## COLORABLE IMITATION

In the law of trade-
marks, this phrase denotes such a close or in-
genious imitation as to be calculated to deceive or-
dinary persons.

## COLORABLE PLEADING

The practice of giving
color in pleading.

## COLORABLE TRANSACTION

One presenting
an appearance which does not correspond with
the reality, and, ordinarily, an appearance intend-
ed to conceal or to deceive. Osborn v. Osborn, 102
Kan. 890, 172 P. 23, 24.

## COLORE OFFICII

Lat. By color of office. Of-
ficer's acts unauthorized by officer's position,
though done in form that purports that acts
are done by reason of official duty and by virtue
of office. Richards v. American Surety Co. of
New York, 48 Ga.App. 102, 171 S.E. 924. See,
also, Color of Office.

## COLORED

By common usage in America, this
term, in such phrases as "colored persons," "the
colored race," "colored men," and the like, is used
to designate negroes or persons of the African
race, including all persons of mixed blood descend-
ed from negro ancestry. Collins v. Oklahoma
State Hospital, 76 Okl. 229, 184 P. 946, 949, 7 A.L.R.
895; Theophanis v. Theophanis, 244 Ky. 689, 51
S.W.2d 957.
But where a state Constitution provided for separate
schools for the white and colored races, the term "white
race" was held to be limited to the Caucasian race, and the
term "colored races" to embrace all other races. Rice v.
Gong Lum, 139 Miss. 760, 104 So. 105, 107.
It has also been held that there is no legal technical
signification to the phrase "colored person" which the
courts are bound judicially to know. Pauska v. Daus, 31
Tex. 74.

## COLPICES

Pullen v. State, 11 Tex.App. 91.

## COM

An abbreviation for "company," exactly
equivalent to "Co." Keith v. Sturges, 51 Ill. 142.

## COMBARONES

In old English law. Fellow-
barons; fellow-citizens ;—the citizens or freemen
of the Cinque Ports being anciently called "bar-
ons;" the term "combarones" is used in this sense
in a grant of Henry III. to the barons of the port
of Fevresham. Cowell.

## COMBAT

A forcible encounter between two or
more persons; a battle; a duel. Trial by battle.
Mutual Combat
One into which both the parties enter willingly
or voluntarily; it implies a common intent to
fight, but not necessarily an exchange of blows.
Aldridge v. State, 59 Miss. 250; Tate v. State, 46
Ga. 158; State v. Moss, 24 N.M. 59, 172 P. 199;
Findley v. State, 125 Ga. 583, 54 S.E. 106.

pree v. Thornton, 97 Neb. 812, 151 N.W. 305, 307,
L.R.A.1917C, 65.
In patent law. A union of different elements.
A patent may be taken out for a new combina-
tion of existing machines. Stevenson Co. v. Mc-
Fassell, C.C.A.Pa., 90 F. 707, 33 C.C.A. 249; Moore
v. Schaw, C.C.Cal., 118 F. 602; Moody v. Fiske, 2
Mas. 112, Fed.Cas.No.9,745.
In patent law. A composition of old or new
elements, and it is patentable, if it produces new
and useful results, though all its constituents were
well known and in common use before it was
made, provided the results are a product of the
combination, and not a mere aggregate of several
results. U. S. Industrial Chemical Co. v. Theroz
Co., C.C.A.Md., 25 F.2d 387, 391.
The distinction between a "combination" and an "aggre-
gation" lies in the presence or absence of mutuality of
action; a "combination" essentially requiring that there
be some joint operation performed by its elements, pro-
ducing a result due to their joint and cooperating action,
while in an "aggregation" there is a mere adding together
of separate contributions, each operating independently
of the other. Ball v. Coker, C.C.A.S.C., 210 F. 278, 282;
Mead Morrision Mfg. Co. v. Exeter Mach. Works, D.C.Pa.,
215 F. 731.

## COMBINATION IN RESTRAINT OF TRADE

A
trust, pool, or other association of two' or more
individuals or corporations having for its object to
monopolize the manufacture or traffic in a partic-
ular commodity, to regulate or control the output,
restrict the sale, establish and maintain the price,
stifle or exclude competition, or otherwise to in-
terfere with the normal course of trade under
conditions of free competition. Northern Securi-
ties Co. v. U. S., 193 U.S. 197, 24 S.Ct. 436, 48 L.Ed.
679; U. S. v. Knight Co., 156 U.S. 1, 15 S.Ct. 249,
39 L.Ed. 325.

## COMBINED CARBON

of iron and steel, carbon in union with some one or
more metallic constituents in the iron alloy. Pitts-
burgh Iron & Steel Foundries Co. v. Seaman-Sleeth
Co., C.C.A.Pa., 248 F. 705, 707.

## COMBING WOOL

combed, employed in the manufacture of worsteds.
Stone & Downer Co. v. U. S., 12 Ct.Cust.App. 62,
63; U. S. v. Stone & Downer Co., 12 Ct.Cust.App.
557. See Clothing Wool.

## COME

To present oneself; to appear in court.
In modern practice, though such presence may be
constructive only, the word is still used to indicate
participation in the proceedings. Horner v.
O'Laughlin, 29 Md. 472. Melfi v. Barney, R.I., 121
A. 67, 68.
Thus, a pleading may begin, "Now comes the defend-
ant," etc. In case of a default, the technical language of
the record is that the party "comes not, but makes
default."

## COMES

A word used in a pleading to indicate
the defendant's presence in court. See Come.

## COMES

Lat. A follower, companion, or at-
tendant; a count or earl.

## COMES AND DEFENDS

This phrase, anciently
used in the language of pleading, and still surviv-
ing in some jurisdictions, occurs at the commence-
ment of a defendant's plea or demurrer; and of
its two verbs the former signifies that he appears
in court, the latter that he defends the action.

## COMFORT

Benefit, consolation, contentment,
ease, enjoyment, happiness, pleasure, or satisfac-
tion. National Surety Co. v. Jarrett, 95 W.Va. 420,
121 S.E. 291.

## COMFORTABLE SPEED

As applied to railway
trains, is a speed which has been developed by ex-
perience and observation to mean that speed at

tine.

## COMITIA

In Roman law. An assembly, either

called the "comitia curiata vel calata"; or (2) of
the Roman centuries, in which case it was called
the "comitia centuriata" (called also comitia ma-
jora) ; or (3) of the Roman tribes, in which case
it was called the "comitia tributa." Only patri-
cians were members of the first comitia, and only
plebians of the last; but the comitia centuriata
comprised the entire populace, patricians and ple-
bians both, and was the great legislative assembly
passing the leges, properly so called, as the senate
passed the senatus consulta, and the comitia tribu-
ta passed the plebiscita. Under the Lex Horten-

willingness to grant a privilege, not as a matter
of right, but out of deference and good will. Dow
v. Lillie, 26 N.D. 512, 144 N.W. 1082, 1088, L.R.A.
1915D, 754; Cox v. Terminal R. Ass'n of St. Louis,
331 Mo. 910, 55 S.W.2d 685.
Comity of Nations
(Lat. comitas gentium)
The most appropriate phrase to express the
true foundation and extent of the obligation of
the laws of one nation within the territories of
another. Story, Confl.Laws, § 38. That body of
rules which states observe towards one another
from courtesy or mutual convenience, although
they do not form part of international law. Holtz.
Enc. s. v. Hilton v. Guyot, 159 U.S. 113, 16 S.Ct.
139, 40 L.Ed. 95; People v. Rushworth, 294 Ill.
455, 128 N.E. 555, 558; Second Russian Ins. Co. v.
Miller, C.C.A.N.Y., 297 F. 404, 409.
It is derived altogether from the voluntary consent of the
latter; and it is inadmissible when it is contrary to its
known policy, or prejudicial to its interests. In the silence
of any positive rule affirming or denying or restraining the
tacit adoption of them by their own government, unless
repugnant to its policy, or prejudicial to its interests. It
,is not the comity of the courts, but the comity of the
nation, which is administered and ascertained in the same
way, and guided by the same reasoning, by which all other
principles of the municipal law are ascertained and guided.
The recognition which one nation allows within its terri-
tory to the legislative, executive, or judicial acts of another
nation, having due regard both to international duty and
convenience and to the rights of its own citizens or of
other persons who are under the protection of its laws.
State ex rel. National Surety Corporation v. Price, 129 Neb.
433, 261 N.W. 894.
"The use of the word 'comity' as expressing the basis of
jurisdiction has been criticized. It is, however, a mere
question of definition. The principles lying behind the
word are recognized. * * * The truth remains that
jurisdiction depends upon the law of the forum, and this
law in turn depends upon the public policy disclosed by
the acts and declarations of the political departments of
the government." Russian Socialist Federated Soviet
Republic v. Cibrario, 235 N.Y. 255, 139 N.E. 259, 260.
Judicial Comity
'
The principle in accordance with which the
courts of one state or jurisdiction will give effect
to the laws and judicial decisions of another, not
as a matter of obligation, but out of deference
and respect. Franzen v. Zimmer, 35 N.Y.S. 612,
90 Hun 103; Stowp v. Bank, C.C.Me., 92 F. 96;
Strawn Mercantile Co. v. First Nat. Bank, Tex.
Civ.App., 279 S.W. 473, 474; Bobala v. Bobala, 68
Ohio App. 63, 33 N.E.2d 845, 849.
There is no statute or common-law rule by which one
court is bound to abide by the decisions of another court
of equal rank. It does so simply for what may be called
comity among judges. There is no common law or statu-
tory rule to oblige a court to bow to its own decisions; it
does so on the ground of judicial comity. (1884) 9 P.D.
98, per Brett, M. R.
Of such a use of the word, however, Dicey says : "The
term 'comity' * * * is open to the charge of implying
that the judge, when he applies foreign law to a particular
case, does so as a matter of caprice or favor."
Comity is not a rule of law, but one of practice, con-
venience and expediency. It is something more than mere
courtesy, which implies only deference to the opinion of
others, since it has a substantial value in securing uni-
formity of decision, and discouraging repeated litigation
of the same question. But its obligation is not imperative.
Comity persuades; but it does not command. It declares
not how a case shall be decided, but how it may with pro-
priety be decided. Mast, Foos & Co. v. Mfg. Co., 177 U.S.
485, 488, 20 S.Ct. 708, 44 L.Ed. 856; National Electric Sig-
naling Co. v. Telefunken Wireless Telegraph Co. of United
States, C.C.A.N.Y., 221 F. 629, 632; Lauer V. Freudenthal,
96 Wash. 394, 165 P. 98, 99.
Comity of States
Simply a phrase designating the practice by
which the courts of one state follow the decision of
another on a like question, though not bound by
law of precedents to do so. Larrick v. Walters, 39
Ohio App. 363, 177 N.E. 642, 645.

## COMMA

A point used to mark the smallest
structural divisions of a sentence, or a rhetorical
punctuation mark indicating the slightest possible
separation in ideas or construction. Travelers'
Ins. Co. v. Pomerantz, 124 Misc. 250, 207 N.Y.S. 81,
COMMAND. An order, imperative direction, or
behest. State v. Mann, 2 N.C. 4; Barney v. Hayes,
applied to a fortress, "command" means actual
control of the garrison for military purposes. As
applied to a ship, it means actual control of the
crew for nautical purposes. Hamilton v. U. S., C.
C.A.Va., 268 F. 15, 19.
The term "instance," as used with reference to doing an
act at one's instance, does not imply the same degree of
obligation to obey as does "command." Feore v. Tram-
mel, 104 So. 808, 813, 213 Ala. 293.

## COMMANDEMENT

In French law. A writ
served by the huissier pursuant to a judgment or
to an executory notarial deed. Its object is to
give notice to the debtor that if he does not pay
the sum to which he has been condemned by the
judgment, or which he engaged to pay by the no-
tarial deed, his property will be seized and sold.
Arg.Fr.Merc.Law, 550.

## COMMANDER IN CHIEF

By article 2, § 2, of
the constitution it is declared that the president
shall be commander in chief of the army and
navy of the United States. The term implies su-
preme control of military operations during the
progress of a war, not only on the side of strategy
tactics, but also in reference to the political

own sustenance, according to his degree. The
manors and lands belonging to the priory of St.
John of Jerusalem were given to Henry the Eighth

It formerly contained a statement of the names of the

W. 227, 228.

various operations become the objects of commercial
regulation. Lorenzetti v. American Trust Co., D.C.Cal., 45

573, 14 L.Ed. 545; Lord v. Steamship Co., 102 U.S.

nations" comprehends every species of commercial inter-
course. U.S.C.A.Const. art. 1, § 8, cl. 3. Board of Trustees

istence of given person or thing and such per-
son or thing perishes, and if contract is rendered
impossible by act of God, the law, or other party.
Wood v. Bartolino, 48 N.M. 175, 146 P.2d 883, 885,
In theory it amounts to no more than a condition or
term of a contract which the law implies to take the place
of a covenant that it is assumed would have been inserted
by the parties had the contingency which arose occurred
to them at the time they made the contract. Lloyd v.
Murphy, Cal.App., 142 P.2d 939, 942, 943. And doctrine is

where parties could not reasonably protect themselves by
terms of a contract against happening of subsequent
events. Berline v. Waldschmidt, 159 Kan. 585, 156 P.2d

A phrase used to designate
the whole body of substantive jurisprudence ap-
plicable to the rights, intercourse, and relations
of persons engaged in commerce, trade, or mer-
cantile pursuits. It is not a very scientific or ac-
curate term. As foreign commerce is carried on
by means of shipping, the term has come to be
used occasionally as synonymous with "maritime
law;" but, in strictness, the phrase "commercial
law" is wider, and includes many transactions or
legal questions which have nothing to do with
shipping or its incidents. Watson v. Tarpley, 18
How. 521, 15 L.Ed. 509;, Williams v. Gold Hill
Min. Co., C.C.Cal., 96 F. 464.

cial paper." In re Hercules Mut. L. Assur. Soc.,
6 Ben. 35, 12 Fed.Cas. 12. Negotiable paper given

## COMMISSION DEL CREDERE

In commercial
law. Where an agent of a seller undertakes to
guaranty to his principal the payment of the debt

word "guaranty" or "warranty."
COMMISSION GOVERNMENT. A method of
municipal government in which the legislative
power is in the hands of a few persons. State v.
Ure, 91 Neb. 31, 135 N.W. 224. Gardner v. Board
of Park Directors, 35 Cal.App. 597, 170 P. 672, 673
(mayor held not a "commissioner").

## COMMISSION MERCHANT

A term which is
synonymous with "factor." It means one who
receives goods, chattels, or merchandise for sale,
exchange, or other disposition, and who is to re-
ceive a compensation for his services, to be paid
by the owner, or derived from the sale, etc., of the
goods. State v. Thompson, 120 Mo. 12, 25 S.W.
346. One whose business is to receive and sell
goods for a commission, being intrusted with the
possession of the goods to be sold, and usually
selling in his own name. Hughes v. Young, 17
Tenn.App. 24, 65 S.W.2d 858, 864.
Factors are frequently called "commission merchants".
and it is said that there is no difference in the meaning of
these terms, the latter being perhaps more commonly used
in America. Thompson v. Woodruff, 7 Cold. 410; Duguid
v. Edwards, 50 Barb., N.Y., 288; Lyon v. Alvord, 18 Conn.
A commission merchant or factor differs from a broker
in that he may buy and sell in his own name without dis-
closing his principal and has the goods in his possession
while the broker can only buy or sell in the name of his
principal, and has no possession of the goods sold. Slack
v. Tucker, 23 Wall. 321, 330, 23 L.Ed. 143; Perkins v.
State, 50 Ala. 154, 156. A commission merchant has a lien
upon the goods for his charges, advances, and commis-
sions, while the broker has no control of the property and
is responsible only for bad faith. A commission merchant
or factor has a special property in the goods. Sutton v.
Kiel Cheese & Butter Co., 155 Ky. 465, 159 S.W. 950, 951.
A "factor" or "commission merchant" is one who has the
actual or technical possession of goods or wares of another
for sale, while a "merchandise broker" is one who nego-
tiates the sale of merchandise without having it in his pos-
session or control, being simply an agent with very limited
powers. Hughes v. Young, 17 Tenn.App. 24, 65 S.W.2d 858,
See, also, Factor.

disputed) a commission of appraisement only is
required. Sweet.

(Mass.) 364; 3 Kent 403; United States v. 1,010.8
Acres, More or Less, Situate in Sussex County,
Del., D.C.Del., 56 F.Supp. 120, 132, 134,
In English law, is an incorporeal right which lies in
grant, originally commencing on some agreement between
lords and tenants, which by time has been formed into
prescription, and continues good, although there be no deed
or instrument to prove the original contract. 4 Coke, 37;
1 Crabb, Real Prop. p. 258, § 268.
Common, or a right of common, is a right or privilege
which several persons have to the produce of the lands or
waters of another. Van Rensselaer v. Radcliff, 10 Wend.,

beasts on the land of another, (in common with
the owner or with others,) which is founded on a
grant, or a prescription which supposes a grant.
1 Crabb, Real Prop. p. 264, § 277.
This kind of common arises from no connection of ten-
ure, and is against common right; it may commence by
grant within time of memory, or, in other words, may be
created at the present day ; it may be claimed as annexed
to any kind of land, and may be claimed for beasts not
commonable, as well as those that are. 2 Bl.Comm. 33;
Van Rensselaer v. Radcliff, 10 Wend., N.Y.,. 649.
—Common because of vicinage is where the in-
habitants of two townships which lie contiguous
to each other have usually intercommoned with
one another, the beasts of the one straying mutual-
ly into the other's fields, without any molestation
from either. 2 Bl.Comm. 33; Co. Litt. 122a; 4
Co. 38a; 10 Q.B. 581, 589, 604; Smith v. Floyd, 18
Barb. (N.Y.) 523.
This Is, indeed, only a permissive right, intended to
excuse what, in strictness, is a trespass in both, and to
prevent a multiplicity of suits, and therefore either town-
ship may inclose and bar out the other, though they have
intercommoned time out of mind.
—Common in gross, or at large. A species of
common which is neither appendant nor appur-
tenant to land, but is annexed to a man's person,
being granted to him and his heirs by deed; or it
may be claimed by prescriptive right, as by a par-
son of a church or the like corporation sole. 2
Bl.Comm. 34. It is a separate inheritance, entire-
ly distinct from any other landed property, vested
in the person to whom the common right belongs.
2 Steph.Comm. 6; Mitchell v. D'Olier, 68 N.J.L.
375, 53 A. 467, 59 L.R.A. 949.
—Common of digging. Common of digging, or
common in the soil, is the right to take for one's
own use part of the soil or minerals in another's
land; the most usual subjects of the right are
sand, gravel, stones, and clay. It is of a very
similar nature to common of estovers and of tur-
bary. Elton, Com. 109.
—Common of estovers. A liberty of taking neces-
sary wood for the use or furniture of a house or
farm from off another's estate, in common with
the owner or with others. 2 Bl.Comm. 35. It
may be claimed, like common of pasture, either
by grant or prescription. 2 Steph.Comm. 10;
Plowd. 381; Van Rensselaer v. Radcliff, 10 Wend.
(N.Y.) 648.

Neb., 246 F. 916, 923.
The term, in its broadest and most obvious sense, would
include all activities prosecuted in the business of the

common end ; nevertheless, an employee, invested with the
duty of overseeing, directing, and controlling workmen, is
not a fellow servant with respect to the discharge of those

people; the articles which are produced to be sold
to the people, to be consumed and used by the
people in general, and to be found for sale in all
the marts of trade. People v. Epstean, 102 Misc.

## COMMON BENCH

The ancient name for the
English court of common pleas. Its original title
appears to have been simply "The Bench," but it
was designated "Common Bench" to distinguish
it from the "King's Bench," and because in it were
tried and determined the causes of common per-
sons, i. e., causes between subject and subject, in
which the crown had no interest.

## COMMON ENEMY DOCTRINE

option lawfully obstruct or hinder the flow of such
water thereon, and in so doing may turn back or
off of his own lands, and onto and over the lands
of other proprietors, such water, without liability
by reason of such obstruction or diversion. Mil-
ler v. Letzerich, 121 Tex. 248, 49 S.W.2d 404, 411,
85 A.L.R. 451.

## COMMON HUMANITY DOCTRINE

Miss. 69, 199 So. 310, 312.

## COMMON KNOWLEDGE

clare applicable to action without necessity of
proof. It is knowledge that every intelligent per-
son has. Strain v. Isaacs, 59 Ohio App. 495, 18 N.

experience, history, and facts of which judicial no-
tice may be taken. Shelley v. Chilton's Adm'r, 236
Ky. 221, 32 S.W.2d 974, 977.

## COMMON LAW

As distinguished from the Ro-
man law, the modern civil law, the canon law,
and other systems, the common law is that body
of law and juristic theory which wa, originated,
developed, and formulated and is adr. tinistered in
England, and has obtained among nost of the
states and peoples of Anglo-Saxon stock. Lux v.
Haggin, 69 Cal. 255, 10 P. 674.
As distinguished from law created by the en-
actment of legislatures, the common law compris-
es the body of those principles and rules of action,
relating to the government and security of per-
sons and property, which derive their authority
solely from usages and customs of immemorial
antiquity, or from the judgments and decrees of
the courts recognizing, affirming, and enforcing
such usages and customs; and, in this sense, par-
ticularly the ancient unwritten law of England.
1 Kent, Comm. 492. Western Union Tel. Co. v.
Call Pub. Co., 21 S.Ct. 561, 181 U.S. 92, 45 L.Ed.
765; Barry v. Port Jervis, 72 N.Y.S. 104, 64 App.
Div. 268; U. S. v. Miller, D.C.Wash., 236 F. 798,
As distinguished from equity law, it is a body
of rules and principles, written or unwritten,
which are of fixed and immutable authority, and
which must be applied to controversies rigorously
and in their entirety, and cannot be modified to
suit the peculiarities of a specific case, or colored
by any judicial discretion, and which rests con-
fessedly upon custom or statute, as distinguished
from any claim to ethical superiority. Klever v.
Seawall, C.C.A.Ohio, 65 F. 395, 12 C.C.A. 661.
As distinguished from ecclesiastical law, it is
the system of jurisprudence administered by the
purely secular tribunals.
As concerns its force and authority in the Unit-
ed States, the phrase designates that portion of
the common law of England (including such acts
of parliament as were applicable) which had been
adopted and was in force here at the time of the
Revolution. This, so far as it has not since been
expressly abrogated, is recognized as an organic
part of the jurisprudence of most of the United
States. Industrial Acceptance Corporation v.
Webb, Mo.App., 287 S.W. 657, 660.
The "common law" of England, which is the rule of
decision in all courts of Montana, in so far as it is not
repugnant to the Constitution of the United States or the
Constitution or laws of that state, means that body of
jurisprudence as applied and modified by the courts of this
country up to the time it was adopted in Montana. Herrin
v. Sutherland, 74 Mont. 587, 241 P. 328, 330, 42 A.L.R. 937.
See, also, Norvell-Wilder Hardware Co. v. McCamey, Tex.
Civ.App., 290 S.W. 772, 773; Fletcher v. Los Angeles
Trust & Savings Bank, 182 Cal. 177, 187 P. 425, 427.
The common law of England, adopted by Pol. Code Cal.
§ 4468, does not refer solely to the lex non scripta, the com-
mon law unmodified by statute, but contemplates the whole
body of jurisprudence as it stood, influenced by statute at
the time when the Code section was adopted, and also
embraces equity. Martin v. Superior Court of California
in and for Alameda County, 176 Cal. 289, 168 P. 135, 136,
L.R.A.1918B, 313.
In a wider sense than any of the foregoing, the
"common law" may designate all that part of the
positive law, juristic theory, and ancient custom
of any state or nation which is of general and
universal application, thus marking off special or
local rules or customs.
For "Federal Common Law," see that title.
As a compound adjective "common-law" is un-
derstood as contrasted with or opposed to "statu-
tory," and sometimes also to "equitable" or to
"criminal." See examples below.

"cheating" at common law. State v. Renick, 33
Or. 584, 56 Pac. 275, 44 L.R.A. 266, 72 Am.St.Rep.

## COMMON-LAW CONTEMPT

A name sometimes
applied to proceedings for contempt which are
criminal in their nature, as distinguished from
those which are intended as purely civil remedies
ordinarily arising out of the alleged violation of
some order entered in the course of a chancery
proceeding. People v. Samuel, 199 Ill.App. 294,
297; People v. Buconich, 199 Ill.App. 410, 412.

house Co. v. Trustee, 117 Ky. 478, 78 S.W. 413, 64

ed in the ordinary way, but created by an agree-
ment to marry, followed by cohabitation; a con-

lins v. Hoag and Rollins, 121 Neb. 716, 238 N.W.
•
There must be a public and continued recognition of such
relation by the parties as distinguished from occasional or
incidental recognition. Whitaker v. Shenault, Tex.Civ.
App., 172 S.W. 202, 203.

sons after due inscription. Gates v. Gaither, 46
La.Ann. 286, 15 So. 50.

76; that of 1854, St. 17 & 18 Vict. c. 125; and that

## COMMON-LAW REMEDY

This phrase, within
the meaning of U. S. Judicial Code 1911, § 256
(Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1100, see His-
torical and Revision Notes under 28 U.S.C.A. §
1333), was not limited to remedies in the com-
mon-law courts, but embraced all methods of en-
forcing rights and redressing injuries known to
the common or statutory law. Kennerson v.
Thames Towboat Co., 89 Conn. 367, 94 A. 372, 375,
L.R.A. 1916A, 436. See, also, Northern Pacific S.

See Court
of Common Pleas.

## COMMON RECOVERY

In conveyancing. A spe-
cies of common assurance, or mode of conveying
lands by matter of record, formerly in frequent
use in England. It was in the nature and form
of an action at law, carried regularly through,
and ending in a recovery of the lands against the
tenant of the freehold; which recovery, being a
supposed adjudication of the right, bound all per-
sons, and vested a free and absolute fee-simple in
the recoverer. 2 Bl.Comm. 357. Christy v. Burch,
25 Fla. 942, 2 So. 258. Common recoveries were
abolished by the statutes 3 & 4 Wm. IV. c. 74.
They were resorted to when the object was to create an
absolute bar of estates tail, and of the remainders and re-
versions expectant on the determination of such estates. 2
BlaComm. 357. Though it has been used in some of the
states, this form of conveyance is practically obsolete,
easier and less expensive modes of making conveyances
having been substituted. Frost v. Cloutman, 7 N. H. 9, 26
Am. Dec. 723.

## COMMONABLE

Entitled to common. Common-
able beasts are either beasts of the plow, as hors-
es and oxen, or such as manure the land, as kine

goats, and the like. Co. Litt. 122a; 2 Bl.Comm. 33.

## COMMONALTY

mass of the people, excluding the nobility.
The body of people composing a municipal cor-
poration, excluding the corporate officers.

eties, etc., in England are usually granted to the master,
wardens, and commonalty of such corporation.

## COMMONANCE

The commoners, or tenants and
inhabitants, who have the right of common or
commoning in open field. Cowell.

## COMMONERS

In English law. Persons having
a right of common. So called because they have
a right to pasture on the waste, in common with

## COMMONS

The class of subjects in Great
Britain exclusive of the royal family and the no-
bility. They are represented in parliament by the
house of commons.
Part of the demesne land of a manor, (or land
the property of which was in the lord,) which,
being uncultivated, was termed the "lord's waste,"

## COMMONTY

ing acquired rights of servitude. Bell.

## COMMONWEALTH

The public or common weal
or welfare. This cannot be regarded as a techni-
cal term of public law, though often used in poli-
tical science. It generally designates, when so
employed, a republican frame of government,—
one in which the welfare and rights of the entire
mass of people are the main consideration, ra-
ther than the privileges of a class or the will of
a monarch; or it may designate the body of citi-
zens living under such a government.
Sometimes it may denote the corporate entity,
or the government, of a jural society (or state)
possessing powers of self-government in respect
of its immediate concerns, but forming an integral
part of a larger government, (or nation.) State
v. Lambert, 28 S.E. 930, 44 W.Va. 308.
In this latter sense, it is the official title of several of
the United States (as Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Vir-
ginia, and Kentucky), and would be appropriate to them
all. In the former sense, the word was used to designate
the English government during the protectorate of Crom-
well.
See Government; Nation; State.

## COMMORANCY

an inhabitant; which consists in usually lying

Prevost v. Morgenthau, 106 F.2d 330, 334, 70 App.
D.C. 306.

## COMMUNICATION

Information given, the shar-
ing of knowledge by one with another; confer-
ence; consultation or bargaining preparatory to
making a contract. Intercourse; connection. Al-
so, the Masonic equivalent for the word "meet-
ing." State v. Goodwyn, 83 W.Va. 255, 98 S.E. 577.
Something said by one person to another ;-so used in a
statute providing that neither a party nor his or her spouse
shall be examined as a witness as to personal transactions
or communications between witness and persons since de-
ceased. Secor v. Slyer, 188 Iowa, 1126, 161 N.W. 769, 772,
176 N.W. 981.
"Transactions and communications," within statute
declaring inadmissible testimony of interested witness con-
cerning transactions and communications between himself
and deceased person, embrace every variety of affairs which
conform to the subject of negotiation, interviews, or actions
between two persons, and include every method by which
one person can derive impressions or information from the
conduct, condition or language of another. Bright v. Vir-
ginia & Gold Hill Water Co., C.C.A.Nev., 270 F. 410, 413.
The act of communicating;-so used in a statute declar-
ing that no husband or wife shall be compelled to disclose
any confidential communication made by one to the other
during marriage. Whitford v. North State Life Ins. Co.,
163 N.C. 223, 79 S.E. 501, 502, Ann.Cas.1915B, 270. In a
broader sense, the word embraces all knowledge upon the
part of either obtained by reason of the marriage relations,
and which but for the confidence growing out of such rela-
tion would not have been known. Prudential Ins. Co. of
America v. Pierce's Adm'r, 270 Ky. 216, 109 S.W.2d 616, 617.
As used in a statute providing that an attorney cannot,
without the consent of his client, be examined as to any
communication made by the client, "communication" is
not restricted to mere words but includes acts as well. Ex
parte McDonough, 170 Cal. 230, 149 P. 566, 567, L.R.A.
1916C, 593, Ann.Cas.1916E, 327.
French Law

livering them either to a person designated by
the court, or to his adversary, to be examined in
all their parts, and as shall be deemed necessary
to the suit. Arg. Fr. Merc. Law, 552.
-Confidential communications. These are certain
classes of communications, passing between per-
sons who stand in a confidential or fiduciary rela-
tion to each other, (or who, on account of their
relative situation, are under a special duty of sec-
recy and fidelity,) which the law will not permit
to be divulged, or allow them to be inquired into
in a court of justice, for the sake of public policy
and the good order of society. Examples of such
privileged relations are those of husband and wife
and attorney and client. Hatton v. Robinson, 14
Pick.Mass. 416, 25 Am.Dec. 415; Parker v. Carter,
4 Munf.Va. 287, 6 Am.Dec. 513; Parkhurst v. Ber-
dell, 110 N.Y. 386, 18 N.E. 123, 6 Am.St.Rep. 384.
dence. A communication made to a counsel, soli-
citor, or attorney, in professional confidence, and
which he is not permitted to divulge; otherwise
called a "confidential communication." 1 Starkie,
Ev. 185.
In the law of libel and slander. A defamatory
statement made to another in pursuance of a duty,
political, judicial, social, or personal, so that an
,
action for libel or slander will not lie, though the-
statement be false, unless in the last two cases
actual malice be proved in addition. Bacon v.
Railroad Co., 66 Mich. 166, 33 N.W. 181; 5 E. &
B. 347.
When a communication is fairly made by one in the dis-
charge of a public or private duty, legal, moral, or social,
of perfect or imperfect obligation, or in the conduct of his
own affairs, to one who has a corresponding interest to
receive such communication, it is "privileged," Interna-
tional & G. N. Ry. Co. v. Edmundson, Tex.Com.App., 222
S.W. 181, 183, if made in good faith and without actual
malice, Baker v. Clark, 186 Ky. 816, 218 S.W. 280, 285. A
"privileged communication" is one made in good faith,
upon any subject-matter in which the party communicating
has an interest, or in reference to which he has, or hon-
estly believes he has, a duty, and which contains matter
which, without the occasion upon which it is made, would
be defamatory and actionable. Peak v. Taubman, 251 Mo.
390, 158 S. W. 656, 663. In a "privileged communication"
the words used, if defamatory and libelous, are excused,
while in "fair comment" the words are not a defamation
of plaintiff and not libelous. Van Lonkhuyzen v. Daily
News Co., 203 Mich. 570, 170 N.W. 93, 99.
Privileged communications are either (1) absolutely priv-
ileged, or (2) conditionally or qualifiedly privileged.
Grantham v. Wilkes, 135 Miss. 777, 100 So. 673. An "abso-
lutely privileged communication" is one made in the inter-
est of the public service or the due administration of jus-
tice, and is practically limited to legislative and judicial
proceedings and other actions of state. Grantham v.
Wilkes, 135 Miss. 777, 100 So. 673. By an "absolutely priv-
ileged" publication is not to be understood a publication
for which the publisher is in no wise responsible, but it
means a publication in respect of which, by reason of the
occasion upon which it is made, no remedy can be had in a
civil action for slander or libel, Peterson v. Cleaver, 105
Neb. 438, 181 N.W. 187, 189, 15 A.L.R. 447, even though the
words are published maliciously and with knowledge of
their falsity, Spencer v. Looney, 116 Va. 767, 82 S.E. 745,
747. A "qualifiedly privileged communication" is a
slanderous statement uttered in good faith upon a proper
occasion and from a proper motive based upon an honest
belief that it is true, but, unlike communications wholly
privileged, the defendant has the burden of proving want
of malice or ill will. Peak v. Taubman, 251 Mo. 390, 158
S. W. 656, 665. A communication "qualifiedly privileged"
is one which is prima facie privileged only, and in which
the privilege may be lost by proof of malice in the publi-
cation. Spencer v. Looney, 116 Va. 767, 82 S.E. 745, 747.
A communication made in good faith upon any subject-
matter in which the party communicating has an interest
or in reference to which he has a duty, either legal, moral,
or social, if made to a person having a corresponding inter-
est or duty, is "qualifiedly privileged." Peterson v. Clea-
ver, 105 Neb. 438, 181 N.W. 187, 189, 15 A.L.R. 447; Mas-
see v. Williams, C.C.A.Tenn., 207 F. 222, 230; German-
American Ins. Co. v. Huntley, 62 Okl. 39, 161 P. 815, 818.

## COMMUNIS ERROR FACIT JUS

Common error
makes law. 4 Inst. 240; Noy, Max. p. 37, max. 27.
Common error goeth for a law. Finch, Law, b. 1,
c. 3, no. 54. Common error sometimes passes cur-
rent as law. Broom, Max. 139,440.
What was at first illegal is presumed, when repeated
many times, to have acquired the force of usage; and then
it would be wrong to depart from it. 1 Ld.Raym. 42; 6
Cl. & F. 172; 3 M. & S. 396; Goodman v. Eastman, 4 N.H.
458; Kent v. Kent, 2 Mass. 357; Davey v. Turner, 1 Da11.
13, 1 L.Ed. 15. The converse of this maxim is communis
error non tacit jus. A common error does not make law.
4 Inst. 242; 3 Term 725; 6 Term 564.

any theory or system of social organization in-
volving common ownership of agents of produc-
tion of industry, the latter of which theories is re-
ferred to in the popular, use of the word "com-
munism" while the scientific usage sometimes con-
forms to the first alone and sometimes alternates
between the first and second; also the principles
and theories of the Communist Party, especially
in Soviet Russia. Feinglass v. Reinecke, D.C.Ill.,
48 F.Supp. 438, 440. ,
Any theory or system of social organization involving
common ownership of the agents of production, and some
approach to equality in the distribution of the products of

F.2d 627, 631, 70 App.D.C. 354.
The term "community," as used in a statute proNlding
that communities may be incorporated for the purpose of
supplying inhabitants with water, should be construed to
include all the inhabitants of a district having a community
of interest in obtaining for themselves in common a water
supply for domestic use. Hamilton v. Rudeen, 112 Or.
268, 224 P. 92, 93.
In connection with the rule requiring, for purposes of
impeachment, a knowledge of the character of the witness
in the community or neighborhood in which he resides, the

State, 22 Ala.App. 39, 111 So. 767, 769.
Civil Law

French Law
A species of partnership which a man and a
woman contract when they are lawfully married
to each other. See, also, Community Property,
infra.
Conventional community is that which is form-

By this contract the legal community which would other-
wise subsist may be modified as to the proportions which
each shall take, and as to the things which shall com-
pose it.
Legal community is that which takes place by
virtue of the contract of marriage itself.
The French system of community property was known
as the dotal system, and the Spanish as the ganancial sys-
tem. The conquest of Mexico by the Spaniards and their
acquisition of the Florida territory resulted in the intro-
duction on American soil of the Spanish system, which
now prevails, usually in a somewhat modified form, in
Texas, California, Nevada, Arizona, Washington, Idaho,
New Mexico, Porto Rico, and the Philippines. Ballinger,
Com.Property, § 6; Chavez v. McKnight, 1 N.M. 147. The
Louisiana Code has, with slight modifications, adopted the
dotal system of the Code Nepoleon as regards the separate
rights of husband and wife, but as to their common prop-
erty, it retained the essential features of the Spanish
ganancial system.

in the definition of a partnership, (to which a com
munity of profits is essential,) means a proprietor
ship in them as distinguished from a persona

by purchase, or in any other similar way, even althoug
the purchase be only in the name of one of the two, an
not of both, because in that case the period of time whe
the purchase is made is alone attended to, and not th
person who made the purchase. Rev.Civ.Code La. art
2402, 2404; Brown v. Cobb, 10 La. 172; Barnes v. Thom
son, 154 La. 1036, 98 So. 657, 658.

of punishment, while a "pardon" avoids or terminates pu
ishment for crime; Lupo v. Zerbest, C.C.A.Ga., 92 F.2
362, 364. A pardon bears no relation to the term of pu
ishment, and must be accepted or it is nugatory ; comm
tation removes no stain, restores no civil privilege, and ma
be effected without the consent and against the will of th
prisoner. In re Charles, 115 Kan. 323, 222 P. 606, 60
Chapman v. Scott, D.C.Conn., 10 F.2d 156, 159.

COMPANIES CLAUSES CONSOLIDATION ACT.
An English statute, (8 Vict. c. 16,) passed in 1845,
which consolidated the clauses of previous laws
still remaining in force on the subject of public
companies. It is considered as incorporated into
all subsequent acts authorizing the execution of
undertakings of a public nature by companies,
unless expressly excepted by such later acts. Its
purpose is declared by the preamble to be to avoid
repeating provisions as to the constitution and
management of the companies, and to secure
greater uniformity in such provisions. Wharton.

## COMPANION OF THE GARTER

knights of the Order of the Garter.

## COMPANIONS

In French law. A general term,
comprehending all persons who compose the crew
of a ship or vessel. Poth. Mar. Cont. no. 163.

## COMPANULATE

Can Co. v. Goldee Mfg. Co., D.C.N.Y., 290 F. 523,
527,

## COMPANY

A society or association of persons,
in considerable number, interested in a common
object, and uniting themselves for the prosecution
usually of some commercial or industrial under-
taking, or other legitimate business. Mills v.
State, 23 Tex. 303; Smith v. Janesville, 52 Wis.
680, 9 N.W. 789.
The proper signification of the word "company," when
applied to persons engaged in trade, denotes those united
for the same purpose or in a joint concern. It is so com-
monly used in this sense, or as indicating a partnership,
that few persons accustomed to purchase goods at shops,
where they are sold by retail, would misapprehend that
such was its meaning. Palmer v. Pinkham, 33 Me. 32.
The term is not identical with "partnership," although
every unincorporated society is, in its legal relations, a
partnership. In common use a distinction is made, the
name "partnership" being reserved for business associa-
tions of a limited number of persons (usually not more
than four or five) trading under a name composed of their
individual names set out in succession; while "company"
is appropriated as the designation of a society comprising
a larger number of persons, with greater capital, and
engaged in more extensive enterprises, and trading under
a title not disclosing the names of the individuals. Attor-
ney General v. Mercantile Marine Ins. Co., 121 Mass. 525.
Sometimes the word is used to represent those members
of a partnership whose names do not appear in the name
of the firm. See 12 Toullier, 97.
A number of persons united for performing or carrying
on anything jointly. In re Tidewater Coal Exchange,
C.C.A.N.Y., 280 F. 638, 643.
Thus, the term is not necessarily limited to a trading or
commercial body, but may include an unincorporated I
provide mutual aid and protection through the payment of
death benefits. In re Order of Sparta, D.C.Pa., 238 F. 437.
"Company" is a generic and comprehensive word, which
may include individuals, partnerships, and corporations.
Asbury v. Town of Albemarle, 162 N.C. 247, 78 S.E. 146,
148, 44 L.R.A.,N.S., 1189; Ellerson v. Grove, C.C.A.N.C., 44
F.2d 493, 497. But not a municipality. City of Los An-
geles, Cal., v. Eighth Judicial District Court, 58 Nev. 1, 67
P.2d 1019, 1023.
The word is sometimes applicable to a single individual.
Harger v. Harger, 144 Ark. 375, 222 S.W. 736, 739. But
compare Wood v. Wood, 78 Or. 181, 151 P. 969, 970, L.R.A.
1916C, 251, Ann.Cas.1918A, 226.
Joint Stock Company
An association of individuals for purposes of
profit, possessing a common capital contributed
by the members composing it, such capital being
commonly divided into shares of which each mem-
ber possesses one or more, and which are trans-
ferable by the owner. Shelf. Jt. St. Co. 1. One
having a joint stock or capital, which is divided
into numerous transferable shares, or consists of
transferable stock. Lindl. Partn. 6. A partner-
ship whereof the capital is divided, or agreed to
be divided, into shares so as to be transferable
without the express consent of the co-partners.
Pars. Part. § 435. A quasi partnership, invested
by statutes in England and many of the states
with some of the privileges of a corporation. See
Pennsylvania v. Mining Co., 10 Wall. 556, 19 L.
Ed. 998; L.R. 4 Eq. 695. It lies midway between
a corporation and a copartnership. Rocky Moun-
tain Stud Farm Co. v. Lunt, 46 Utah, 299, 151 P.
521, 527.
A "joint-stock company" is an entirely different organi-
zation from a "corporation," although it has many of the
same characteristics and is often not improperly called a
quasi corporation, especially under particular statutes, but
in Kentucky it is still what it was at common law, namely,
a hybrid midway between a corporation and a partnership,
that is, it had directors and officers, articles of association,
a common capital divided into shares which represented the
interests of the members and are transferable without the
consent of the other members so that the death of a mem-
ber does not dissolve the company—but, on the other hand,
each member was liable for the debts of the concern, so
that such company had characteristics of both a corpora-
tion and a partnership. Roller v. Madison, 172 Ky. 693, 189
S. W. 914, 915.
Limited Company
A company in which the liability of each share-
holder is limited by the number of shares he has
taken, so that he cannot be called on to contribute
beyond the amount of his shares. In England, the
memorandum of association of such company may
provide that the liability of the directors, mana-
ger, or managing director thereof shall be unlimit-
ed. 30 & 31 Vict. c. 131; 1 Lindl. Partn. 383;
Mozley & Whitley.
Public Company
In English law. A business corporation; a so-
ciety of persons joined together for carrying on
some commercial or industrial undertaking.

## COMPARABLE ACCOMMODATION

Within the
rule that it is the rent generally prevailing on the
freeze date for comparable accommodations in a
defense-rental area that determines rent that may
be charged, two accommodations are "compara-
ble" if they are sufficiently similar to be regarded
by an expert as of substantially equal rental value
or if they are sufficiently similar so that an ex-
pert taking as a standard the rent prevailing for
one and making allowances for such differences
as would be reflected in rental value would be
able to determine the appropriate corresponding
rent for the other. Sirianni v. Bowles, Em.App.,
148 F.2d 343, 344.

## COMPARATIO LITERARUM

(S.C.) 412.

## COMPARATIVE JURISPRUDENCE

son of various systems of law.

## COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE

That doctrine
in the law of negligence by which the negligence
of the parties is compared, in the degrees of
"slight," "ordinary," and "gross" negligence, and
a recovery permitted, notwithstanding the con-
tributory negligence of the plaintiff, when the
negligence of the plaintiff is slight and the neg-
ligence of the defendant gross, but refused when
the plaintiff has been guilty of a want of ordinary
care, thereby contributing to his injury, or when
the negligence of the defendant is not gross, but
only ordinary or slight, when compared, under
the circumstances of the case, with the contribu-
tory negligence of the plaintiff. 3 Amer. & Eng.
Enc. Law, 367. St. Louis & S. F. R. Co. v. Elsing,
37 Okl. 333, 132 P. 483, 486.
Where negligence by both parties is concurrent and con-
tributes to injury, recovery is not barred under such doc-
trine, but plaintiff's damages are diminished proportion-
ately, provided his fault is less than defendant's, and that,
by exercise of ordinary care, he could not have avoided
consequences of defendant's negligence after it was or
should have been apparent. Rogers v. McKinley, 48
Ga.App. 262, 172 S.E. 662, 664.

## COMPARISON OF HANDWRITING

A compari-
son by the juxtaposition of two writings, in order,
by such comparison, to ascertain whether both
were written by the same person.
A method of proof resorted to where the genu-
ineness of a written document is disputed; it con-
sists in comparing the handwriting of the disput-
ed paper with that of another instrument which
is proved or admitted to be in the writing of the
party sought to be charged, in order to infer, from
their identity or similarity in this respect, that
they are the work of the same hand. Johnson v.
Insurance Co., 105 Iowa, 273, 75 N.W. 101,
COMPARATIVE RECTITUDE. Doctrine wherein
relief by divorce is granted to the party least in
fault when both have shown grounds for divorce.

W. 823, 824.
In an allegation that plaintiff was compelled to pay

import elements of compulsory payment. Singer Sewing
Mach. Co. v. Teasley, 198 Ala. 673, 73 So. 969, 971; Sinnott
v. District Court in and for Clarke County, 201 Iowa, 292,

pensation is payable, and date of such an injury is
not time of the accident or occurrence causing

tion accrues. S. G. Taylor Chain Co. v. Marianow-
ski, 182 N.E. 584, 585, 95 Ind.App. 120. Muehl-

1 Hagg.Cons. 144; 1 Hagg.Eccl. 714; Wood v.
Wood, 2 Paige, Ch. (N.Y.) 108, 2 D. & B. 64; Bi-
shop, Marr. & D. §§ 393, 394.

## COMPENSATION

Indemnification; payment of

for a loss sustained; equivalent given for prop-
erty taken or for an injury done to another; giv-
ing back an equivalent in either money which is
but the measure of value, or in actual value other-
wise conferred; recompense in value; recompense

pecially when it is given by statute; remunera-
tion for the injury directly and proximately caus-
ed by a breach of contract or duty; remunera-
tion or satisfaction for injury or damage of every
description; that return which is given for some-

done, or money which a court or other tribunal
orders to be paid, by a person whose acts or omis-
sions have caused loss or injury to another, in
order that thereby the person damnified may re-
ceive equal value for his loss, or be made whole
in respect of his injury. Railroad Co. v. Denman,
10 Minn. 280 (Gil. 208) ; Hughson Condensed Milk
Co. v. State Board of Equalization, 23 Cal.App.2d
281, 73 P.2d 290, 292. For "Extra Compensation"
and "Fair and Reasonable Compensation", see
these titles.
"Compensation" is a misleading term, and is used merely
for lack of a word more nearly expressing the thought of
the law which permits recovery for an imponderable and
intangible thing for which there is no money equivalent.
Stutsman v. Des Moines City Ry. Co., 180 Iowa, 524, 163
N.W. 580, 585.
The word "compensation," as used in Workmen's Com-
pensation Acts, means the money relief afforded an injured
employee or his dependents according to the scale estab-
lished and for the persons designated in the act, and not
the compensatory damages recoverable in an action at law
for a wrong done or a contract broken. Christensen v.
Morse Dry Dock & Repair Co., 214 N.Y.S. 732, 740, 216
As used in Workmen's Compensation Acts, "compensa-
tion" is distinguishable from "benefits" ; the former apply-
ing to an allowance where the employee is only injured,
and the latter applying in case of death. Terry v. General
Electric Co., 232 N.Y. 120, 133 N.E. 373, 374. The term
"compensation" may include ftlneral benefits. Donoho v.
Atlantic Basin Iron Works, 206 N.Y.S. 494, 495, 210 App.
Div. 535. But see Barber v. Estey Organ Co., 100 Vt. 72,
135 A. 1, 2; Industrial Commission v. Hammond, 77 Colo.
414, 236 P. 1006, 1008.
Also that equivalent in money which is paid to
the owners and occupiers of lands taken or injur-
iously affected by the exercise of the power of
eminent domain. Louisiana and F. Plank Road
Co. v. Pickett, 25 Mo. 535, 539; Oregon Short Line
R. Co. v. Fox, 28 Utah 311, 78 P. 800, 801.
In the constitutional provision for "just compensation"
for property taken under the power of eminent domain,
this term means a payment in money. Any benefit to the
remaining property of the owner, arising from public
works for which a part has been taken, cannot be consid-
ered as compensation. Railroad Co. v. Burkett, 42 Ala. 83.
As compared with consideration and damages, compen-
sation, in its most careful use, seems to be between them.
Consideration is amends for something given by consent, or
by the owner's choice. Damages is amends exacted from a
wrong-doer for a tort. Compensation is amends for some-
thing which was taken without the owner's choice, yet
without commission of a tort. Thus, one should say, con-
sideration for land sold; compensation for land taken for
a railway; damages for a trespass. But such distinctions
are not uniform. Land damages is a common expression
for compensation for lands taken for public use. Abbott.
"Compensation" is distinguishable from "damages,"
inasmuch as the former may mean the sum which will
remunerate an owner for land actually taken, while the
latter signifies an allowance made for injury to the residue:
but such distinction is not ordinarily observed. Faulkner
v. City of Nashville, 154 Tenn. 145, 285 S.W. 39, 43.
The remuneration or wages given to an em-
ployee or, especially, to an officer. Salary, pay,
or emolument. Christopherson v. Reeves, 44 S‘ .D.
634, 184 N.W. 1015, 1019; Higgins v. Glenn, 65
Utah, 406, 237 P. 513, 515.
The ordinary meaning of the term "compensation," as
applied to officers, is remuneration, in whatever form it
may be given, whether it be salaries and fees, or both
combined. State v. Bland, 91 Kan. 160, 136 P. 947, 949. It
is broad enough to include other remuneration for official
services; State ex rel. Emmons v. Farmer, 271 Mo. 306,
196 S. W. 1106, 1108; such as mileage or traveling expenses ;
Leckenby v. Post Printing & Publishing Co., 65 Colo. 443,
176 P. 490, 492; and also the repayment of amounts
expended. Compare, however, People v. Chapman, 225
N.Y. 700, 122 N.E. 240; McCoy v. Handlin, 35 S.D. 487, 153
N.W. 361, 371, L.R.A.1915E, 858, Ann.Cas.1917A, 1046.
But the term is not necessarily synonymous with "sal-
ary." See People v. Wemple, 115 N.Y. 302, 22 N.E. 272;
Com. v. Carter, 21 Ky.L.Rep. 1509, 55 S.W. 701; Crawford
County v. Lindsay, 11 Il1.App. 261; Kilgore v. People, 76
Ill. 548.
A "reasonable compensation" is that which will fairly
compensate the laborer when the character of the work and
the effectiveness and ability entering into the service are
considered. Chapman v. A. H. Averill Machinery Co., 28
Idaho, 121, 152 P. 573, 575.
Compensation is not synonymous with "pension," which
is ordinarily a gratuity from the government or some of
its subordinate agencies in recognition of, but not in pay-
ment for, past services. Dickey v. Jackson, 181 Iowa 1155,
165 N.W. 387, 389.
The Civil, Scotch, and French Law
Recoupment; set-off. The meeting of two debts
due by two parties, where the debtor in the one
debt is the creditor in the other; that is to say,
another, and therefore, to the extent of what is
due to him, claims allowance out of the sum that
he is due. Bell; 1 Kames, Eq. 395, 396.
In order for "compensation" to take place, the two debts
must exist simultaneously and have as their object the
payment of a sum of money or a certain quantity of con-
sumable things of one and the same kind, and the debts
must be equally liquidated and demandable. Blanchard v.
Bank of Morgan City & Trust Co., La.App., 185 So. 120,
Compensation is of three kinds,-legal, or by operation
of law; compensation by way of exception; and by recon-
vention. Stewart v. Harper, 16 La.Ann. 181; Blanchard v.
Cole, 8 La. 158; 8 Dig. 16, 2; Code, 4, 31; Inst. 4, 6, 30;
Burge, Suret. b. 2, c. 6, p. 181; La.Civ. Code, arts. 2203-
2208 (Civ.Code, arts. 2207-2211).
Criminal Law
Recrimination. See Compensatio Criminis; Re-
crimination.
"Commutation" and "compensation" in statutes provid-
ing for reduction of sentence for good behavior are used
interchangeably. Ryan v. Lawes, 278 N.Y.S. 608, 154 Misc.

## COMPENSATION PERIOD

The period fixed by
the Workmen's Compensation Act during which
the injured party is to receive compensation, un-
less the board reduces the period by correspond-
ingly increasing the amount of weekly compensa-
tion. Southern Casualty Co. v. Boykin, Tex.Civ.
App., 298 S.W. 639, 640.

## COMPENSATORY DAMAGES

See Damages.

## COMPERENDINATIO

In the Roman law. The
adjournment of a cause, in order to hear the par-
ties or their advocates a second time; a second
hearing of the parties to a cause. Calvin.

## COMPERTORIUM

In the civil law. A judicial
inquest made by delegates or commissioners to
find out and relate the truth of a cause. Wharton.

## COMPERUIT AD DIEM

A plea in bar of an ac-
tion of debt on a bail bond that the defendant ap-
peared at the day required. For forms, see 5
Wentworth 470; Lilly, Entr. 114; 2 Chit. Pl. 527.
See, generally, Comyns, Dig. Pleader (2 W. 31);
7 B. & C. 478.

## COMPETE

To contend emulously, to strive for
the position for which another is striving, to con-
tend in rivalry. People v. Chew, 67 Colo. 394,
179 P. 812, 813; Commonwealth v. Shenandoah
River Light & Power Corporation, 135 Va. 47, 115
S.E. 695, 698. See Competition.

## COMPETENCY

In the law of evidence. The
presence of those characteristics, or the absence
of those disabilities, which render a witness legal-
ly fit and qualified to give testimony in a court
of justice;-applied, in the same sense, to docu-
ments or other written evidence.
Competency differs from credibility. The former is a
question which arises before considering the evidence giv-
en by the witness; the latter concerns the degree of
credit to be given to his story. The former denotes the
personal qualification of the witness; the latter his vera-
city. A witness may be competent, and yet give incredible
testimony; he may be incompetent, and yet his evidence,
if received, be perfectly credible. Competency is for the
court; credibility for the jury. Yet in some cases the
term "credible" is used as an equivalent for "competent."
Thus, in a statute relating to the execution of wills, the
term "credible witness" is held"to mean one who is entitled
to be examined and to give evidence in a court of justice;
not necessarily one who is personally worthy of belief, but
one who is not disqualified by imbecility, interest, crime,
or other cause. 1 Jarm.Wills, 124; Smith v. Jones, 68 Vt.
132, 34 A. 424; Corn. v. Holmes, 127 Mass. 424, 34 Am.Rep.
In French law. The right in a court to exercise
jurisdiction in a particular case.

## COMPETENT

quirements; having sufficient ability or authority;

able; legally fit. Levee Dist. v. Jamison, 176 Mo.
557, 75 S.W. 679; In re Fichter's Estate, 279 N.Y.
S. 597, 600, 155 Misc. 399. See, also, Incompeten-
cy.
A testator may be said to be "competent," if he has
mental capacity to understand the nature of his act, to
understand and recollect the nature and situation of his
property and his relations to persons having claims on his
bounty and whose interests are affected by his will. In
re Smith's Estate, 200 Cal. 152, 252 P. 325, 328.
When generally applied to arbitrators, the term does not
mean "expert." Home Ins. Co. v. Walter, Tex.Civ.App.,
230 S.W. 723, 724.

## COMPETENT AND OMITTED

In Scotch prac-
tice. A term applied to a plea which might have
been urged by a party during the dependence of
a cause, but which had been omitted. Bell.

## COMPETENT AUTHORITY

As applied to
courts and public officers, this term imports juris-
diction and due legal authority to deal with the
particular matter in question. Mitchel v. U. S., 9
Pet. 735, 9 L.Ed. 283; Charles v. Charles, 41 Minn.
201, 42 N.W. 935.

## COMPETENT EVIDENCE

That which the very
nature of the thing to be proven requires, as, the
production of a writing where its contents are the
subject of inquiry. 1 Greenl.Ev. § 2; Hill V. Hill,
216 Ala. 435, 113 So. 306, 308; Goltra v. Pen-
land, 45 Or. 254, 77 P. 129, 133. Also, general-
ly, admissible or relevant, as the opposite of "in-
competent." Ryan v. Town of Bristol, 63 Conn.
261, 27 A. 309, 312.

## COMPETENT COURT

A court, either civil or
criminal, having lawful jurisdiction. People ex
rel. Fisher v. Morhous, 49 N.Y.S.2d 110, 116, 183
Misc. 51.

## COMPETENT WITNESS

One who is legally
qualified to be heard to testify in a cause. People
v. Compton, 123 Cal. 403, 56 P. 44; Bank of Uvalde,
Tex.Civ.App., 60 S.W.2d 888, 889. See Compe-
tency.
As used in the statute relating to the execution of wills,
the term means a person who, at the time of making the
attestation, could legally testify in court to the facts which
he attests by subscribing his name to the will. In re
Wiese's Estate, 98 Neb. 463, 153 N.W. 556, L.R.A.1915E, 832.

## COMPETITION

Rivalry. People ex rel. Broder-
ick v. Goldfogle, 123 Misc. 399, 205 N.Y.S. 870, 877.
The play of contending forces ordinarily engender-
ed by an honest desire for gain. U. S. v. American
Linseed Oil Co., 43 S.Ct. 607, 611, 262 U.S. 371, 67
L.Ed. 1035. The effort of two or more parties,
acting independently, to secure the custom of a
third party by the offer of the most favorable
terms. It is the struggle between rivals for the
same trade at the same time; the act of seeking
or endeavoring to gain what another is endeavor-
ing to gain at the same time. Lipson v. Socony
Vacuum Corporation, C.C.A.Mass., 87 F.2d 265, 270.
As used in a statute taxing moneyed capital competing
with national banks, "competition" means a condition of
business rivalry which arises when moneyed capital is de-
voted with reasonable continuity and regularity to opera-
tions having for their primary and characteristic purpose,
as distinguished from some incidental operations or details,
the transaction of some branch of business which may be
carried on by national banks, and it is not necessary that
this employment shall bring capital into competition with
all of such branches. People ex rel. Pratt v. Goldfogle, 242
N.Y. 277, 151 N.E. 452, 461. The term involves the idea
of struggling to obtain the same thing. First Nat. Bank

## COMPILATION

of the works of others and arranged in a method-
ical manner.
A compilation consists of selected extracts from different
authors; an abridgment is a condensation of the views of
one author. Story v. Holcombe, 4 McLean 306, 314, Fed.
Cas.No.13,497.

## COMPILE

To copy from various authors into
one work. Story v. Holcombe, 23 Fed.Cas. 171,
174. See Compilation,
Such a collection of statutes differs from a code in this,
that none of the laws so compiled derives any new force
or undergoes any modification in its relation to other stat-
utes in pari materia from the fact of the compilation, while
a code is a re-enactment of the whole body of the positive
law and is to be read and interpreted as one entire and
homogeneous whole.

## COMPILED STATUTES

A collection of the
statutes existing and in force in a given state, all
laws and parts of laws relating to each subject-
matter being brought together under one head,
and the whole arranged systematically in one
book, either under an alphabetical arrangement or
some other plan of classification. Railway Co. v.
State, 31 S.E. 531, 104 Ga. 831; Black, Interp.
Laws, p. 363; Fidelity and Columbia Trust Co. v.
Meek, 294 Ky. 122, 171 S.W.2d 41, 44.

## COMPLAINANT

In practice. One who applies
to the courts for legal redress; one who exhibits
a bill of complaint. This is the proper designation
of one suing in equity, though "plaintiff" is often,
used in equity proceedings as well as at law. Ben-
efit Ass'n v. Robinson, 147 Ill. 138, 35 N.E. 168.
One who instigates prosecution or who prefers
accusation against suspected person. State v.
Snyder, 93 N.J.L, 18, 107 A. 167, 168.

## COMPLAINT

In civil practice. In those states
having a Code of Civil Procedure, the complaint
is the first or initiatory pleading on the part of
the plaintiff in a civil action. It corresponds to
the declaration in the common-law practice. Code
N.Y. § 141; McMath v. Parsons, 26 Minn. 246, 2
N.W. 703. Its purpose is to give defendant infor-
mation of all material facts on which plaintiff re-
lies to support his demand. Fox v. Cosgriff, 64
Idaho 448, 133 P.2d 930, 932,
The complaint shall contain : (1) The title of the cause,
specifying the name of the court in which the action is
brought, the name of the county in which the trial is re-
quired to be had, and the names of the parties to the ac-
tion, plaintiff and defendant. (2) A plain and concise
statement of the facts constituting a cause of action, with-
out unnecessary repetition; and each material allegation
shall be distinctly numbered. (3) A demand of the relief
to which the plaintiff supposes himself entitled. If the
recovery of money be demanded, the amount thereof must
be stated. Code N.C.1883, § 233 (C.S. § 506).
Cross-complaint. In code practice. Whenever the de-
fendant seeks affirmative relief against any party, relating
to or depending upon the contract or transaction upon
which the action is brought, or affecting the property to
which the action relates, he may, in addition to his an-
swer, file at the same time, or by permission of the court
subsequently, a cross-complaint.' The cross-complaint must
be served upon the parties affected thereby, and such par-
ties may demur or answer thereto as to the original com-
plaint. Standley v. Insurance Co., 95 Ind. 254; Harrison
v. McCormick, 69 Cal. 616, 11 P. 456; Bank v. Ridpath, 29
Wash. 687, 70 P. 139. This is allowed when a defendant has
a cause of action against a co-defendant, or a person not a
party to the action, and affecting the subject-matter of the
action. The only real difference between a complaint and
a cross-complaint is that the first is filed by the plaintiff
and the second by the defendant. Both contain a state-
ment of the facts, and each demands affirmative relief up-
on the facts stated. The difference between a counter-claim
and a cross-complaint is that in the former the defendant's
cause of action is against the plaintiff; and the latter,
against a co-defendant, or one not a party to the action;
White v. Reagan, 32 Ark. 290.
In criminal law. A charge, preferred before
a magistrate having jurisdiction, that a person
specified offense, with an offer to prove the fact,
to the end that a prosecution may be instituted.
It is a technical term, descriptive of proceedings
before a magistrate. Hobbs v. Hill, 157 Mass. 556,
32 N.E. 862; In some instances "complaint" is in-
terchangeable with "information." State v. Staf-
ford, 26 Idaho, 381, 143 P. 528, 530; State v. Rit-
zier, 17 Ohio App. 394, 395. And is often used in-
terchangeably with "affidavit." Hebebrand v.
State, 129 Ohio St. 574, 196 N.E. 412, 415.

## COMPLETE

To finish; accomplish that which
one starts out to do. Ries v. Williams, 190 Ky.
596, 228 S.W. 40, 41.
COMPLETE, adj. Full; entire; including every
item or element of the thing spoken of, without
omissions or deficiencies; as, a "complete" copy,
record, schedule, or transcript. Bailey v. Martin,
119 Ind. 103, 21 N.E. 346.
Perfect; consummate; not lacking in any ele-
ment or particular; as in the case of a "complete
legal title" to land, which includes the possession,

## COMPOSITIO MENSURARUM

not printed, mentioned in the statute 23 Hen. VIII,
c. 4; establishing a standard of measures. 1 Bl.
Comm. 275.
COMPOSITIO ULNARUM ET PERTICARUM.
The statute of ells and perches. The title of an
English statute establishing a standard of meas-

## COMPOSITION

An agreement, made upon a
sufficient consideration, between an insolvent or
embarrassed debtor and his creditors, whereby
the latter, for the sake of immediate or sooner
payment, agree to accept a dividend less than the
whole amount of their claims, to be distributed
whole. Bank v. McGeoch, 92 Wis. 286, 66 N.W.
606; Pioneer Minerals Corporation v. Larabic
Bros. Bankers, 99 Mont. 358, 43 P.2d 884, 886.
"Composition" should be distinguished from.
"accord." The latter properly denotes an arrange-
ment between a debtor and a single creditor for a
discharge of the obligation by a part payment or
on different terms. The former designates an ar-
rangement between a debtor and the whole body
of his creditors (or at least a considerable propor-
tion of them) for the liquidation of their claims
by the dividend offered.
Ancient Law
Among the Franks, Goths, Burgundians, and
other barbarous peoples, this was the name given
to a sum of money paid, as satisfaction for a
wrong or personal injury, to the person harmed,
or to his family if he died, by the aggressor. It
was originally made by mutual agreement of the
parties, but afterwards established by law, and
took the place of private physical vengeance.

sets, upon condition of his making the payments

Gravel Co., 216 Iowa 909, 249 N.W. 664, 666, 667.
The difference between a common-law "composition with
creditors" and a "composition in bankruptcy" is that in a
composition with creditors the creditors voluntarily release
the principal debtor and therefore release co-debtors, while
in the case of a bankruptcy composition the discharge is
by operation of law and not by act of the creditors who
assent to the composition. Barker v. Ackers, 29 Cal.App.2d
162, 84 P.2d 264, 271.

Bros. v. U. S., 8 Ct.Cust.App. 21, 24.

i. e., when the interest of a sum of money is added

tion; to withhold from utterance or declaration;
to cover or keep from sight. Hopper v. Hopkins,
162 Md. 448, 160 A. 166, 167.
The synonyms of conceal are "to hide; disguise, dis-
semble; secrete." To hide is generic; "conceal" is simp-
ly not to make known what we wish to secrete; disguise or
dissemble is to conceal by assuming some false appearance;
to secrete is to hide in some place of secrecy. A man may
conceal facts, disguise his sentiments, dissemble his feel-
ings, or secrete stolen goods. Darneal v. State, 14 Oki.Cr.
540, 174 P. 290, 292, 1 A.L.R. 638.
The word "conceal," according to the best lexicograph-

der. People v. Miles, 55 Cal. 207.

## CONCEALMENT

A withholding of something

Iowa, 132 Cal.App. 283, 22 P.2d 582.
The terms "misrepresentation" and "concealment" have
a known and definite meaning in the law of insurance.
Misrepresentation is the statement of something as fact
which is untrue in fact, and which the assured states,
knowing it to be not true, with an intent to deceive the
underwriter, or which he states positively as true, without
knowing it to be true, and which has a tendency to mis-
lead, such fact in either case being material to the risk.
Concealment is the designed and intentional withholding
of any fact material to the risk, which the assured, in
honesty and good faith, ought to communicate to the un-
derwriter; mere silence on the part of the assured, es-
pecially as to some matter of fact which he does not con-
sider it important for the underwriter to know, is not to
be considered as such concealment. If the fact so untruly
stated or purposely suppressed is not material, that is, if
the knowledge or ignorance of it would not naturally in-
fluence the judgment of the underwriter in making the
contract, or in estimating the degree and character of the
risk, or in fixing the rate of the premium, it is not a
"misrepresentation" or "concealment," within the clause
of the conditions annexed to policies. Daniels v. Insurance
Co., 12 Cush. (Mass.). 416, 59 Am.Dec. 192; Sun Ins. Of-
fice, Limited, of London v. Mallick, 160 Md. 71, 153 A. 35,
CONCEALMENT MAY BE BASIS OF ESTOP-
PEL, Lo Bue v. Porazzo, 48 Cal.App.2d 82, 119
P.2d 346, 348. Elements 'of such estoppel are
concealment of material facts with knowledge
thereof, ignorance thereof on part of person to
whom representations are made, or from whom
facts are concealed, intention that such person
shall act thereon, and action induced thereby on
his part. Rhoads v. Rhoads, Mo., 119 S.W.2d
247, 152; Rosser v. Texas Co., 173 Okl. 309, 48 P.
2d 3'27, 330.
The doctrine of "estoppel by concealment and suppres-
sion" applies only where there has been reduction to prac-
tice of invention. Bogoslowsky v. Huse, 142 F.2d 75, 76,
31 C.C.P.A. (Patents) 1034.

## CONCEALMENT OF CAUSE OF ACTION

To
constitute it so as to prevent running of limita-
tions, some trick or artifice must be employed to
prevent inquiry or elude investigation, or to mis-
lead and hinder party who has a cause of action

lent. Middleton v. Pruden, 57 Ga.App. 555, 196

TATEM ACCIPIENDA. 8 Coke, 90. A beneficial
condition, which creates an estate, ought to be
construed favorably, according to the intention of
the words; but a condition which destroys an
estate is odious, and ought to be construed strict-
ly according to the letter of the words.
CONDITIO DICITUR, CUM QUID IN CASUM IN-
CERTUM QUI POTEST TENDERE AD ESSE
AUT NON ESSE, CONFERTUR. Co. Litt. 201.
It is called a "condition," when something is giv-
en on an uncertain event, which may or may not
come into existence.

## CONDITIO ILLICITA HABETUR PRO NON ADJECTA

An unlawful condition is deemed as
not annexed.

## CONDITIO PR1ECEDENS ADIMPLERI DEBET PRIUS QUAM SEQUATUR EFFECTUS

Co.
Litt. 201. A condition precedent must be fulfill-
ed before the effect can follow.

## CONDITION

A future and uncertain event up-
on the happening of which is made to depend the
existence of an obligation, or that which subor-
dinates the existence of liability under a contract
to a certain future event. Standard Surety &
Casualty Co. v. Wynn, Tex.Civ.App., 172 S.W.2d
789, 792; Barber Asphalt Paving Co. v. St. Louis
Cypress Co., 121 La. 152, 46 So. 193, 197.
Civil Law
The rank, situation, or degree of a particular
person in some one of the different orders of so-
ciety.
An agreement or stipulation in regard to some
uncertain future event, not of the essential nature
of the transaction, but annexed to it by the par-
ties, providing for a change or modification of
their legal relations upon its occurrence. Mack-
eld. Rom. Law, § 184.
Classification. Conditions are of the following
several kinds:
The casual condition is that which depends on
chance, and is in no way in the power either of
the creditor or of the debtor. Civ.Code La. art.
A mixed condition is one that depends at the
same time on the will of one of the parties and
on the will of a third person, or on the will of
one of the parties and also on a casual event.
Civ.Code La. art. 2025.
The potestative condition is that which makes
the execution of the agreement depend on an event
which it is in the power of the one or the other
of the contracting parties to bring about or to
hinder. Civ.Code La. art. 2024.
A resolutory or dissolving condition is that
which, when accomplished, operates the revoca-
tion of the obligation, placing matters in the same
state as though the obligation had not existed.
It does not suspend the execution of the obliga-
tion. It only obliges the creditor to restore what
he has received in case the event provided for in
the condition takes place. Civ.Code La. art. 2045;
Moss v. Smoker, 2 La.Ann. 991.
A suspensive condition is that which depends,
either on a future and uncertain event, or on an
event which has actually taken place, without its
being yet known to the parties. In the former
case, the obligation cannot be executed till after
the event; in the latter, the obligation has its ef-
fect from the day on which it was contracted, but
it cannot be enforced until the event be known.
Civ.Code La. art. 2043; New Orleans v. Railroad
Co., 18 S.Ct. 875, 171 U.S. 312, 43 L.Ed. 178; Moss
v. Smoker, 2 La.Ann. 991. A condition which pre-
vents a contract from going into operation until
it has been fulfilled.
Common Law
The rank, situation, or degree of a particular
person in some one of the different orders of so-
ciety; or his status or situation, considered as a
juridical person, arising from positive law or the
institutions of society. Thill v. Pohlman, 76 Iowa,
638, 41 N.W. 385.
A clause in a contract or agreement which has
for its object to suspend, rescind, or modify the
principal obligation, or, in case of a will, to sus-
pend, revoke, or modify the devise or bequest; a
qualification, restriction, or limitation modifying
or destroying the original act with which it is
connected; an event, fact, or the like that is
necessary to the occurrence of some other, though
not its cause; a prerequisite. Towle v. Rem-
sen, 70 N.Y. 303.
A modus or quality annexed by him that hath
an estate, or interest or right to the same, where-
by an estate, etc., may either be defeated, enlarg-
ed, or created upon an uncertain event. Co.Litt.
201a.
A qualification or restriction annexed to a con-
veyance of lands, whereby it is provided that in
case a particular event does or does not happen,
or in case the grantor or grantee does or omits to
do a particular act, an estate shall commence, be
enlarged, or be defeated. Anderson v. Palladine,
39 Cal.App. 256, 178 P. 553, 554.
An "estate on condition" arises where an estate is grant-
ed, either in fee simple or otherwise, with an express
qualification annexed, whereby the estate granted shall
either commence, be enlarged, or be defeated, upon per-
formance or breach of such qualification or condition.
Hall v. Quinn, 190 N.C. 326, 130 S.E. 18, 20. Moe v. Gier,
116 Cal.App. 403, 2 P.2d 852, 855.
In insurance parlance, the printed conditions on the in-
side of the policy which serve generally as a limitation of
risk or of liability or impose various conditions requiring
compliance by the insured. Federal Intermediate Credit
Bank of Baltimore v. Globe & Rutgers Fire Ins. Co., D.C.
Md., 7 F.Supp. 56, 68.
Mode or state of being; state or situation; es-
sential quality; property; attribute. Consolidat-
ed Arizona Smelting Co. v. Egich, 22 Ariz. 543,
199 P. 132, 134.
Classification. The different kinds of conditions
known to the common law may be arranged and
described as follows:
Express and implied conditions are also called by the
older writers, respectively, conditions in deed (or in fact,
the Law French term being conditions en fait) and condi-
tions in law. Co. Litt. 201a.
They are either express or implied, the former
when incorporated in express terms in the deed,
contract, lease, or grant; the latter, when infer-
red or presumed by law, from the nature of the
transaction or the conduct of the parties, to have
been tacitly understood between them as a part
of the agreement, though not expressly men-
tioned. 2 Crabb, Real Prop. p. 792; Bract. fol. 47;
Civ.Code La. art. 2026; Raley v. Umatilla County,
15 Or. 172, 13 P. 890, 3 Am.St.Rep. 142.
They are possible or impossible; the former
when they admit of performance in the ordinary
course of events; the latter when it is contrary
to the course of nature or human limitations that
they should ever be performed.
They are lawful or unlawful; the former when
their character is not in violation of any rule,
principle, or policy of law; the latter when they
are such as the law will not allow to be made.
They are consistent or repugnant; the former
when they are in harmony and concord with the
other parts of the transaction; the latter when
they contradict, annul, or neutralize the main pur-
pose of the contract. Repugnant conditions are
also called "insensible."
They are affirmative or negative; the former
being a condition which consists in doing a thing;
as provided that the lessee shall pay rent, etc.,
and the latter being a condition which consists in
not doing a thing; as provided that the lessee
shall not alien, etc. Shep. Touch. 118.
They are precedent or subsequent. A condition
precedent is one which must happen or be per-
formed before the estate to which it is annexed
can vest or be enlarged; or it is one which is to
be performed before some right dependent there-
on accrues, or some act dependent thereon is per-
formed. Federal Land Bank of Louisville v. Luck-
enbill, 213 Ind. 616, 13 N.E.2d 531, 533. A "con-
dition precedent" is one that is to be performed
before the agreement becomes effective, and which
calls for the happening of some event or the per-
formance of some act after the terms of the con-
tract have been agreed on, before the contract
shall be binding on the parties. Rogers v. Malon-
ey, 85 Or. 61, 165 P. 357, 358; Mercer-Lincoln Pine
Knob Oil Co. v. Pruitt, 191 Ky. 207, 229 S.W. 374.
A condition subsequent is one annexed to an es-
tate already vested, by the performance of which
such estate is kept and continued, and by the fail-
ure or non-performance of which it is defeated;
or it is a condition referring to a future event,
upon the happening of which the obligation be-
comes no longer binding upon the other party, if
he chooses to avail himself of the condition. Co.
Litt. 201; Carroll v. Carroll's Ex'r, 248 Ky. 386,
58 S.W.2d 670, 672.
Conditions may also be positive (requiring that
a specified event shall happen or an act be done)
and restrictive or negative, the latter being such
as impose an obligation not to do a particular
thing, as, that a lessee shall not alien or sub-let
or commit waste, or the like. Shep. Touch. 118.
They may be single, copulative, or disjunctive.
Those of the first kind require the performance of
one specified thing only; those of the second kind
require the performance of divers acts or things;
those of the third kind require the performance
of one of several things. Shep. Touch. 118.
Conditions may also be independent, dependent,
or mutual. They belong to the first class when
each of the two conditions must be performed
without any reference to the other; to the second
class when the performance of one condition is
not obligatory until the actual performance of
the other; and to the third class when neither
party need perform his condition unless the oth-
er is ready and willing to perform his, or, in oth-
er words, when the mutual covenants go to the
whole consideration on both sides and each is pre-
cedent to the other. Huggins v. Daley, W.Va., 99
F. 609, 40 C.C.A. 12, 48 L.R.A. 320.
The following varieties may also be noted: A.
condition collateral is one requiring the perform-
ance of a collateral act having no necessary re-
lation to the main subject of the agreement. A
compulsory condition is one which expressly re-
quires a thing to be done, as, that a lessee shall
pay a specified sum of money on a certain day or
his lease shall be void. Shep. Touch. 118. Con-
current conditions are those which are mutually
dependent and are to be performed at the same
time. Milwaukee Land Co. v. Ruesink, 50 Mont.
489, 148 P. 396, 401. A condition inherent is one
annexed to the rent reserved out of the land
whereof the estate is made, or rather, to the es-
tate in the land, in respect of rent. Shep. Touch.
French Law
The following peculiar distinctions are made:
(1) A condition is easuelle when it depends on a
chance or hazard; (2) a condition is potestative
when it depends on the accomplishment of some-
thing which is in the power of the party to ac-
complish; (3) a condition is mixte when it de-
pends partly on the will of the party and partly
on the will of others; (4) a condition is suspen-
sive when it is a future and uncertain event, or
present but unknown event, upon which an ob-
ligation takes or fails to take effect; (5) a con-
dition is resolutoire when it is the event which
undoes an obligation which has already had ef-
fect as such. Brown.
Synonyms Distinguished
A "condition" is to be distinguished from a
limitation, in that the latter may be to or for the
benefit of a stranger, who may then take advan-
tage of its determination, while only the grantor,
or those who stand in his place, can take advan-
tage of a condition. Hoselton v. Hoselton, 166
Mo. 182, 65 S.W. 1005; and in that a limitation
ends the estate without entry or claim, which is
not true of a condition. It also differs from a
conditional limitation. In determining whether,
in the case of estates greater than estates for
years, the language constitutes a "condition" or
a "conditional limitation," the rule applied is that,
where an estate is so expressly limited by the
words of its creation that it cannot endure for any
longer time than until the condition happens on
which the estate is to fail, this is limitation, but
when the estate is expressly granted on condition
in deed, the law permits it to endure beyond the
time of the contingency happening, unless the
grantor takes advantage of the breach of condi-
tion, by making entry. Lonas v. Silver, 195 N.Y.
S. 214, 215, 201 App.Div. 383; Yarbrough v. Yar-
brough, 151 Tenn. 221, 269 S.W. 36, 38. It differs
also from a covenant, which can be made by either
grantor or grantee, while only the grantor can
make a condition (Co. Litt. 70) ; De Grasse v. Ver-
ona Mining Co., 185 Mich. 514, 152 N.W. 242, 246;
The chief distinction between a condition subse-
remedy in event of breach, which, in the former
case, subjects the estate to a forfeiture, and in
the latter is merely a ground for recovery of dam-
ages. Bartell v. Senger, 160 Md. 685, 155 A. 174,
176. A charge is a devise of land with a bequest
out of the subject-matter, and a charge upon the
devisee personally, in respect of the estate de-
vised, gives him an estate on condition. A con-
dition also differs from a remainder; for, while
the former may operate to defeat the estate be-
fore its natural termination, the latter cannot take
effect until the completion of the preceding es-
tate.

## CONDITIONAL

That which is dependent upon
or granted subject to a condition.
As to conditional "Acceptance," "Appearance,"
"Bequest," "Contract," "Delivery," "Devise,"
"Fee," "Guaranty," "Judgment," "Legacy," "Lim-
itation," "Obligation," "Pardon," "Privilege," and
"Sale," see those titles.

## CONDITIONALLY PRIVILEGED COMMUNICA- TION

One made in good faith on any subject
matter in which the person publishing has an in-
terest, or in reference to which he has a duty, if
made to a person having a corresponding interest
or duty, even though it contains matter which oth-
erwise would be actionable. Cook v. East Shore
Newspapers, 327 Ill.App. 559, 64 N.E.2d 751, 760.
The essential elements of a "conditionally priv-
ileged communication" are good faith, an interest
to be upheld, a statement limited in its scope to
such purpose, a proper occasion, and publication
in a proper manner to proper persons. Cook v.
East Shore Newspaper, 327 Ill.App. 559, 64 N.E.
2d 751.
CONDITIONES QUIELIBET ODIOSIE; MAX-

not be repeated. Pain v. Pain, 37 Mo.App. 115.,
Betz v. Betz, 25 N.Y.Super.Ct. 696; State v. Man-
os, 204 N.C. 52, 167 S.E. 493; Thum v. Thum, 105
Colo. 352, 98 P.2d 279, 280.
"Condonation," to constitute valid defense in divorce
action, must be free, voluntary, and not induced by duress
or fraud; "condonation" means pardon of offense, volun-
tary overlooking or implied forgiveness by treating offend-
er as if offense had not been committed. Panther v. Panth-
er, 147 Okl. 131, 295 P. 219, 221. The term is also some-
times applied to forgiveness of a past wrong, fault, injury,
or breach of duty in other relations, as, for example, in
that of master and servant. Leatherberry v. Odell, C.C.
N.C., 7 F. 648. Also, antenuptial unchastity is capable of

CONFEDERACY,
Criminal Law
The association or banding together of two or
more persons for the purpose of committing an
act or furthering an enterprise which is forbidden
by law, or which, though lawful in itself, becomes
unlawful when made the object of the confederacy.

International Law
A league or agreement between two or more in-
dependent states whereby they unite for their mu-
tual welfare and the furtherance of their common
aims. The term may apply to a union so formed
for a temporary or limited purpose, as in the case
of an offensive and defensive alliance; but it is
more commonly used to denote that species of poli-
tical connection between two or more independent
states by which a central government is created,
invested with certain powers of sovereignty,
(mostly external,) and acting upon the several
component states as its units, which, however,
retain their sovereign powers for domestic pur-
poses and some others. See Federal Government.

## CONFEDERATION

mutual support, particularly of princes, nations,
or states. Such was the colonial government dur-
ing the Revolution.

## CONFERENCE

A meeting of several persons for
deliberation, for the interchange of opinion, or
for the removal of differences or disputes. Thus,
a meeting between a counsel and solicitor to ad-
vise on the cause of their client.
In the practice of legislative bodies, when the
two houses cannot agree upon a pending measure,
each appoints a committee of "conference," and
the committees meet and consult together for the
purpose of removing differences, harmonizing con-
flicting views, and arranging a compromise which
will be accepted by both houses.
French Law
A concordance or identity between two laws
or two systems of laws.

agents of two or more powers, for the purpose
of making statements and explanations that will

of error, admitting the same.

## CONFESSIO

Lat. A confession. Confessio
judicio, a confession made in or before a court.

## BATIONE MAJOR EST

A confession made in
court is of greater effect than any proof. Jenk.
Cent. 102.

## CONFESSION

In criminal law. A voluntary
statement made by a person charged with the
commission of a crime or misdemeanor, communi-
cated to another person, wherein he acknowledges
himself to be guilty of the offense charged, and
discloses the circumstances of the act or the share
and participation which he had in it. Spicer v.
Com., 21 Ky.L.Rep. 528, 51 S.W. 802. State v. Gib-
son, 69 N.D. 70, 284 N.W. 209, 214, 215, 219; Sango
v. State, 52 Okl.Cr. 359, 5 P.2d 400, 401; Edwards
v. State, Okl.Cr.App., 288 P. 359, 361. Also the
act of a prisoner, when arraigned for a crime or
misdemeanor, in acknowledging and avowing that
he is guilty of the offense charged.
"Confession" comprises whole criminal charge; where-
as, "admission" relates only to particular fact or circum-
stance covered thereby. State v. Davis, 212 Iowa 131, 235
N.W. 759, 761.
Classification
Confessions are divided into judicial and ex-
trajudicial. The former are such as are made
before a magistrate or court in the due course of
legal proceedings; they include confessions made
in preliminary examinations before magistrates.
Mularkey v. State, 199 Wis. 269, 225 N.W. 933,
934. The latter are such as are made by a party
elsewhere than in court or before a magistrate,
1 Greenl. Ev. § 216, State v. Corey, 182 Minn. 48,
233 N.W. 590, 591; Foster v. State, 79 Okl.Cr. 183,
152 P.2d 929, 932; Louette v. State, 152 Fla. 495,
12 So.2d 168, 172; whether to an official or non-
official person, Prather v. State, 76 Okl.Cr. 385, 137
P.2d 249, 252. One made by the party out of court,
or to any person, official or otherwise, when made
not in the course of a judicial examination or in-
vestigation. State v. Stevenson, 98 Or. 285, 193 P.
1030, 1032.
An implied confession is where the defendant,
in a case not capital, does not plead guilty but
indirectly admits his guilt by placing himself at
the mercy of the court and asking for a light sen-
tence. 2 Hawk. P. C. p. 469; State v. Conway,
20 R.I. 270, 38 A. 656. An indirect confession is
one inferred from the conduct of the defendant.
An involuntary confession is one induced by hope,
promise, fear, violence, torture, or threat. Lyons
v. State, 77 Okl.Cr. 197, 138 P.2d 142, 148; Lyons
v. State, 140 P.2d 248. People v. Tielke, 259 Ill.
8$, 102 N.E. 229, 231. A naked confession is an
admission of the guilt of the party, but which is
not supported by any evidence of the commission
of the crime. A relative confession, in the older
criminal law of England, "is where the accused
confesseth and appealeth others thereof, to be-
come an approver," (2 Hale, P. C. c. 29,) or in
other words to "turn king's evidence." This is
now obsolete, but something like it is practiced
in modern law, where one of the persons accused
or supposed to be involved in a crime is put on
the witness stand under an implied promise of
pardon. State v. Willis, 71 Conn. 293, 41 A. 820.
A simple confession is merely a plea of guilty.
Black's Law Dictionary Revised 4th Ed.-24
tary confession is one made spontaneously by a
person accused of crime, free from the influence
of any extraneous disturbing cause, and in par-
ticular, not influenced, or extorted by violence,
threats, or promises. State v. Clifford, 86 Iowa,
550, 53 N.W. 299, 41 Am.St.Rep. 518.
No confession induced by official threat of prosecution is
voluntary. Cannan v. U. S., C.C.A.Tex., 19 F.2d 823, 824;
State v. Dolan, 86 N.J.L. 192, 90 A. 1034, 1035.
It need not be spontaneous nor proceed wholly at maker's
suggestion, but may be set in motion by external causes,
so long as such influences are not what the law deems
improper. People v. Vinci, 295 111. 419, 129 N.E. 193, 195.
For extrajudicial confession, see, also, the title
Extrajudicial.

## CONFESSION AND AVOIDANCE

A plea in con-
fession and avoidance is one which avows and
confesses the truth of the averments of fact in the
declaration, either expressly or by implication, but
then proceeds to allege new matter which tends
to deprive the facts admitted of their ordinary
legal effect, or to obviate, neutralize, or avoid
them. Bavarian Brewing Co. v. Retkowski, 113 A.
903, 907, 1 W.W.Flarr. (Del.) 225; Brown v. Jones,
137 Or. 520, 3 P.2d 768, 769.

## CONFESSION OF DEFENSE

In English prac-
tice. Where defendant alleges a ground of de-
fense arising since the commencement of the ac-
tion, the plaintiff may deliver confession of such
defense and sign judgment for his costs up to the
time of such pleading, unless it be otherwise or-
dered. Jud. Act 1875, Ord. XX, r. 3.

## CONFESSION OF JUDGMENT

See Judgment.

## CONFESSO, BILL TAKEN PRO

In equity prac-
tice. An order which the court of chancery makes
when the defendant does not file an answer, that
the plaintiff may take such a decree as the case
made by his bill warrants.

## CONFESSOR

An ecclesiastic who receives auri-
cular confessions of sins from persons under his
spiritual charge, and pronounces absolution upon
them. The secrets of the confessional are not
privileged communications at common law, but
this has been changed by statute in some states.
See 1 Greenl. Ev. §§ 247, 248.

## CONFESSORIA ACTIO

Lat. In the civil law.
An action for enforcing a servitude. Mackeld.
Rom. Law, § 324.
CONFESSUS IN JUDICIO PRO JUDICATO
HABETUR, ET QUODAMMODO SUA SENTEN-
TIA 11 Coke, 30. A person confes-
sing his guilt when arraigned is deemed to have
been found guilty, and is, as it were, condemned
by his own sentence.

## CONFIDE

A synonym of the word "trust," and
means to put into one's trust or keeping. Burch
v. McMillin, Tex., 15 S.W.2d 86, 90.

## CONFIDENCE

Trust; reliance; ground of trust.
In the construction of wills, this word is con-
sidered peculiarly appropriate to create a trust.
nearly a synonym, as the English language is cap-
able of. Trust is a confidence which one man
reposes in another, and confidence is a trust."
Appeal of Coates, 2 Pa. 133.

## CONFIDENCE GAME

Obtaining of money or
property by means of some trick, device, or swind-
ling operation in which advantage is taken of the
confidence which the victim reposes in the swind-
ler. People v. Mutchler, 309 Ill. 207, 140 N.E. 820,
822, 35 A.L.R. 339; Roll v. People, 243 P. 641, 643,
78 Colo. 589; People v. Epstein, 338 Ill. 631, 170
N.E. 678, 679. For distinction between false pre-
tenses and confidence game, see False Pretenses.
One obtaining property by unlawful means, other than
by fraudulently obtaining and then abusing victim's con-
fidence, is not guilty of obtaining property by means of
"confidence game." Bomareto v. People, 111 Colo. 99, 137
P.2d 402, 404.

## CONFIDENTIAL

Intrusted with the confidence
of another or with his secret affairs or purposes;
intended to be held in confidence or kept secret.

## CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS

See Com-
munication.

## CONFIDENTIAL CREDITOR

This term has
been applied to the creditors of a failing debtor
who furnished him with the means of obtaining
credit to which he was not entitled, involving in
loss the unsuspecting and fair-dealing creditors.
Gay v. Strickland, 112 Ala. 567, 20 So. 921.

## CONFIDENTIAL RELATION

A fiduciary rela-
tion. These phrases are used as convertible terms.
It is a peculiar relation which exists between
client and attorney, principal and agent, principal
and surety, landlord and tenant, parent and child,
guardian and ward, ancestor and heir, husband
and wife, trustee and cestui que trust, executors or
administrators and creditors, legatees, or distribu-
tees, appointer and appointee under powers, and
partners and part owners. In these and like cases,
the law, in order to prevent undue advantage
from the unlimited confidence or sense of duty
which the relation naturally creates, requires the
utmost degree of good faith in all transactions
between the parties. Shell Petroleum Corporation
v. Pratt, D.C.Kan., 22 F.Supp. 304, 305, 306. It is
not confined to any specific association of parties.
It appears when the circumstances make it cer-
tain that the parties do not deal on equal
terms, but on the one side there is an over-
mastering influence, or, on the other, weakness,
dependence, or trust, justifiably reposed. The
mere existence of kinship does not, of itself, give
rise to such relation. In re Null's Estate, 302
Pa. 64, 153 A. 137. It covers every form of rela-
tion between parties wherein confidence is reposed
by one in another, and former relies and acts upon
representations of the other and is guilty of no
derelictions on his own part. Peckham v. John-
son, Tex.Civ.App., 98 S.W.2d 408, 416.
The term "confidential relations," within the exception
to the rule that misrepresentations of law will not work
an estoppel, is not confined to the strict fiduciary relation-
ship existing between those having definite, well-recognized
legal relations of trust and confidence, but extends to every
sonal relation, and need not be a legal one. Robbins v.
Law, 48 Cal.App. 555, 192 P. 118, 120; Hitchcock v. Tack-
ett, 208 Ky. 803, 272 S.W. 52, 54.

## CONFINEMENT

Confinement may be by either
a moral or a physical restraint, by threats of vio-
lence with a present force, or by physical re-
straint of the person. Ex parte Snodgrass, 43 Tex.
Cr.R. 359, 65 S.W. 1061.
Restraint by sickness in childbirth; lying-in for
delivery of child, or possibly because of advanced
pregnancy. Rose v. Commonwealth Beneficial
Ass'n, 86 A. 673, 674, 4 Boyce (Del.) 144.
Solitary Confinement
See Solitary Confinement.

tion of the charters. A statute passed in the 25
Edw. I., whereby the Great Charter is declared

denounced against all those that, by word or deed
or counsel, act contrary thereto or in any degree

or makes a conditional estate absolute. Shep.
Touch. 311.

## CONFIRMATIO EST NULLA UBI DONUM PRIE- CEDENS EST INVALIDUM

Moore, 764; Co.
Litt. 295. Confirmation is void where the preced-
ing gift is invalid.
CONFIRMATIO OMNES SUPPLET DEFECTUS,
LICET ID QUOD ACTUM EST AB INITIO NON
VALUIT. Co. Litt. 295b. Confirmation supplies
all defects, though that which had been done was
not valid at the beginning.

## CONFIRMATION

A contract or written mem-
orandum thereof, by which that which was infirm,
difficult of proof, void, imperfect, or subject to be
avoided is ratified, rendered valid and binding,
made firm and unavoidable. Schifferdecker v.
Busch, 225 N.Y.S. 106, 111, 130 Misc, 625.
It implies a deliberate act, intended to renew and ratify
a transaction known to be voidable. Bauer v. Dotterer, 202
Ark. 1055, 155 S.W.2d 54, 57.
A conveyance of an estate or right in esse,
whereby a voidable estate is made sure and un-
avoidable, or whereby a particular estate is in-
creased. Co. Litt. 295b. Beetem v. Garrison, 129
Md. 664, 99 A. 897, 900.
English Ecclesiastical Law
The ratification by the archbishop of the elec-
tion of a bishop by dean and chapter under the
king's letter missive prior to the investment and
consecration of the bishop by the archbishop. 25
Hen. VIII. c. 20.

## CONFIRMATION OF SALE

The confirmation of
a judicial sale by the court which ordered it is a
signification in some way (usually by the entry
of an order) of the court's approval of the terms,

Cooper, 56 Miss. 618; Hyman v. Smith, 13 W.Va.

## CONFIRMAVI

phatic word in the ancient deeds of confirmation.
Fleta, lib. 3, c. 14, § 5.

## CONFIRMEE

tion.

## CONFISCABLE

Capable of being confiscated or
suitable for confiscation; liable to forfeiture.
Camp v. Lockwood, 1 Dall. (Pa.) 393, 1 L.Ed. 194.

## CONFISCARE

In civil and old English law. To
confiscate; to claim for or bring into the fist, or
treasury. Bract. fol. 150.

## CONFISCATE

To appropriate property to the
use of the state. To adjudge property to be for-
feited to the public treasury; to seize and con-
City of Portsmouth v. Public Utilities Commission,
108 Ohio St. 272, 140 N.E. 604, 606; Moscow Fire
Ins. Co. of Moscow, Russia, v. Bank of New York
& Trust Co., 294 N.Y.S. 648, 663, 161 Misc. 903.
Formerly, it appears, this term was used as synonymous
with "forfeit," but at present the distinction between the
two terms is well marked. Confiscation supervenes upon
forfeiture. The person, by his act, forfeits his property;
the state thereupon appropriates it, that is, confiscates it.
Hence, to confiscate property implies that it has first been
forfeited; but to forfeit property does not necessarily im-
ply that it will be confiscated.

## CONFISCATEE

One whose property has been
seized and sold under a confiscation act, e. g., for
unpaid taxes. See Brent v. New Orleans, 41. La.
Ann. 1098, 6 So. 793.
CONFISCATION, The act of confiscating; or of
condemning and adjudging to the public treasury.
"Confiscation" is to be distinguished from "condemna-
tion" as prize. The former is the act of the sovereign
against a rebellious subject; the latter is the act of a bel-
ligerent against another belligerent. Confiscation may be
effected by such means, summary or arbitrary, as the sov-
ereign, expressing its will through lawful channels, may
please to adopt. Condemnation as prize can only be made
in accordance with principles of law recognized in the com-
mon jurisprudence of the world. Both are proceedings in
rem, but confiscation recognizes the title of the original
owner to the property, while in prize the tenure of the
property is qualified, provisional, and destitute of absolute
ownership. Winchester v. U. S., 14 Ct.C1. 48.

## CONFISCATORY RATES

For utility are rates
which do not afford net return sufficient to pre-
serve utility's property and to attract capital nec-
essary to enable utility to discharge its public
duties. Wichita Gas Co. v. Public Service Commis-
sion of Kansas, D.C.Kan., 2 F.Supp. 792, 799.
Rates which do not afford a reasonable return on
value of property at time it is used in public serv-
ice. State v. Tri-State Telephone and Telegraph
Co., 204 Minn. 516, 284 N.W. 294, 305.

## CONFISCATION ACTS

Certain acts of congress,
enacted during the progress of the civil war (1861
and 1862) in the exercise of the war powers of the
government and meant to strengthen its hands
and aid in suppressing the rebellion, which author-
ized the seizure, condemnation, and forfeiture of
"property used for insurrectionary purposes."
Semmes v. U. S., 91 U.S. 27, 23 L.Ed. 193.

## CONFISCATION CASES

The name given to a
group of fifteen cases decided by the United States
supreme court in 1868, on the validity and con-
struction of the confiscation acts of congress. Re-
ported in 7 Wall. 454, 19 L.Ed. 196.

## CONFISK

An old form of confiscate.

## CONFITENS REUS

An accused person who ad-
mits his guilt.

## CONFLICT OF LAWS

Inconsistency or differ-
ence between the municipal laws of different
states or countries, arising in the case of persons
who have acquired rights or a status, or made
contracts, or incurred obligations, within the ter-
ritory of two or more jurisdictions. Hence, that
branch of jurisprudence, arising from the diver-
jurisdictions, in their application to rights and
remedies, which reconciles the inconsistency, or
decides which law or system is to govern in the
particular case, or settles the degree of force to
be accorded to the law of another jurisdiction,
(the acts or rights in question having arisen un-
der it,) either where it varies from the domestic
law, or where the domestic law is silent or not
exclusively applicable to the case in point. In
this sense it is often called "private international
law," a term adopted by Westlake, by Woolsey,
Internatl. Law (5th Ed.) § 73, and others, and
characterized as "handy and manageable," but at
bottom inaccurate, by Dicey, Conflict of Laws,
Moore's Ed. 12, who points out that the defect of
the name "Conflict of Laws" is that the supposed
conflict is fictitious and never really takes place,
and that the expression has the further radical
defect of concealing from view the circumstance
that the question by the law of what country a
given transaction shall be governed is often too
plain to admit of doubt. If, he says, the term
applies to the conflict in the mind of a judge as
to which of two systems of law should govern a
given case, this amounts simply to saying that
the term "conflict of laws" may be used as an in-
accurate equivalent for the less objectionable
phrase "choice of laws." Taylor, Jurisprudence,
611, after considering the opinion of many writers,
concludes that the term "private international
law" is subject to many objections. Holland, Jur-
isprudence, 410, considers it "wholly indefensible,"
as does Gray, Nature, etc., of the Law, 124. Pol-
lock, First Book of Jurispr. 99, prefers the Ger-
man term—Internationales Privatrecht.

## CONFLICT OF PRESUMPTIONS

In this con-
flict certain rules are applicable, viz.: (1) Special
take precedence of general presumptions; (2)
constant of casual ones; (3) presume in favor of
innocence; (4) of legality; (5) of validity; and,
when these rules fail, the matter is said to be at
large. Brown.

## CONFLICTING EVIDENCE

It has been said
that there is not, in a legal sense, a conflict of
evidence unless there is a possibility that men of
ordinary reason and fairness would feel justified
in drawing different conclusions from the evi-
dence before them. Seeley v. Osborne, 220 N.Y.
416, 116 N.E. 97.

## CONFORMITY

Correspondence in form, man-
ner, or use; agreement; harmony; congruity.
Reasonover v. Reasonover, 122 Tex. 512, 58 S.W.
2d 817, 819.
English Ecclesiastical Law
Adherence to the doctrines and usages of the
Church of England.
CONFORMITY ACT, or STATUTE. A term used
to designate Act June 1, 1872, c. 255, § 5, 17 Stat.
197, whence was derived Rev. St. U. S. § 914 pro-
viding that the practice, pleadings, and forms and
modes of proceeding in civil causes, other than
equity and admiralty causes, in the federal dis-
those existing in like causes in the courts of the
state within which such district courts are held.
Since the adoption of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A., the Conformity Act is no
longer effective. De Rosmo v. Feeny, 1941, 38 F.
Supp. 834; Hydraulic Press Mfg. Co. v. Williams,
White & Co., C.C.A.I11.1947, 165 F.2d 489.

## CONFORMITY, BILL OF

See Bill of Conformity.

## CONFRAIRIE

Fr. In old English law. A fra-
ternity, brotherhood, or society. Cowell.

## CONFRERES

Brethren in a religious house;
fellows of one and the same society. Cowell.

## CONFRONTATION

In criminal law, the act of
setting a witness face to face with the prisoner,
in order that the latter may make any objection
he has to the witness, or that the witness may
identify the accused. State v. Behrman, 114 N.C.
797, 19 S.E. 220, 25 L.R.A. 449.
The constitutional right of confrontation does not mean
merely that witnesses are to be made visible to the ac-
cused, but imports the constitutional privilege to croois-ex-
amine them. State v. Crooker, 123 Me. 310, 122 A. 865, 866,
33 A.L.R. 821.

## CONFUSIO

In the civil law. The inseparable
intermixture of property belonging to different
owners; it is properly confined to the pouring
together of fluids, but is sometimes also used of a
melting together of metals or any compound
formed by the irrecoverable commixture of dif-
ferent substances.
It is distinguished from commixtion by the fact that in
the latter case a separation may be made, while in a case
of confusio there cannot be. 2 Bl.Comm. 405.

## CONFUSION

This term, as used in the civil law
and in compound terms derived from that source,
means a blending or intermingling, and is equiva-
lent to the term "merger" as used at common law.
Palmer v. Burnside, 1 Woods, 182 Fed. Cas. No.
10,685.

## CONFUSION OF BOUNDARIES

The title of
that branch of equity jurisdiction which relates
to the discovery and settlement of conflicting, dis-
puted, or uncertain boundaries.

## CONFUSION OF DEBTS

A mode of extinguish-
ing a debt, by the concurrence in the same person
of two qualities or adverse rights to the same
thing which mutually destroy each other. This
may occur in several ways, as where the creditor
becomes the heir of the debtor, or the debtor the
heir of the creditor, or either accedes to the title
of the other by any other mode of transfer.
Woods v. Ridley, 11 Humph. (Tenn.) 198.

## CONFUSION OF GOODS

The inseparable in-
termixture of property belonging to different own-
ers; properly confined to the pouring together of
fluids, but used in a wider sense to designate any
indistinguishable compound of elements belonging
to different owners. The term "confusion" is ap-
plicable to a mixing of chattels of one and the
same general description, differing thus from "ac-
cession," which takes place where various ma-
terials are united in one product. Confusion of
goods arises wherever the goods of two or more
persons are so blended as to have become undis-
tinguishable. 1 Schouler, Pers. Prop. 41. Barker
v. Stearns Coal & Lumber Co., 291 Ky. 184, 163
S.W.2d 466, 471.

## CONFUSION OF RIGHTS

A union of the quali-
ties of debtor and creditor in the same person.
The effect of such a union is, generally, to extin-
guish the debt. 1 Salk. 306; Cro. Car. 551; 1 Ld.
Raym. 515. 5 Term 381; Comyns, Dig. Baron et
Feme (D) ; Baylor University v. Bradshaw, Tex.
Civ.App., 52 S.W.2d 1094, 1101.

## CONFUSION OF TITLES

A civil-law expression,
synonymous with "merger," as used in the com-
mon law, applying where two titles to the same
property unite in the same person. Palmer v.
Burnside, 1 Woods, 179, Fed. Cas, No. 10,685.

## CONFUTE

To prove to be false, defective, or
invalid. Wiley v. Baker, 219 Mich. 629, 190 N.W.
273, 278.

## CONGA

Fr. In French law. Permission, leave,
license; a passport or clearance to a vessel; a
permission to arm, equip, or navigate a vessel.

## CONGA D'ACCORDER

Leave to accord. A per-
mission granted by the court, in the old process of
levying a fine, to the defendant to agree with the
plaintiff. Termes de la Ley; Cowell. See Licen-
tia Concordandi; 2 Bla.Comm. 350.

## CONGA D'EMPARLER

Leave to imparl. The
privilege of an imparlance, (licentia loquendi.) 3
Bl.Comm. 299.

## CONGA D'ESLIRE

Also spelled conge d'elire,
conge dèlire. Cowell; Termes de la Ley; 1 Bla.
Comm. 379, 382. A permission or license from the
British sovereign to a dean and chapter to elect a
bishop, in time of vacation; or to an abbey or
priory which is of royal foundation, to elect an
abbot or prior.

## CONGEABLE

L. Fr. Lawful; permissible; al-
lowable. "Disseisin is properly where a man en-
tereth into any lands or tenements where his en-
try is not congeable, and putteth out him that
hath the freehold." Litt. § 279. See Ricard v.
Williams, 7 Wheat. 107, 5 L.Ed. 398.

## CONGILDONES

In Saxon law. Fellow-members
of a guild.

## CONGIUS

An ancient measure containing about
a gallon and a pint. Cowell.

## CONGREGATE

To come together; to assemble;
to meet. Board of Health of City of Paterson v.
Clayton, 93 N.J.L. 64, 106 A. 813, 814.

## CONGREGATION

An assembly or gathering;
specifically, an assembly or society of persons
who together constitute the principal supporters
of a particular parish, or habitually meet at the
same church for religious exercises. Laird v.
Ecclesiastical Law
Certain bureaus at Rome, where ecclesiastical
matters are attended to.

## CONGREGATIONAL SYSTEM OF CHURCH OR- GANIZATION

Where the local organization is
the governing body and is sufficient unto itself.
Doughty v. Herr, 97 Ind.App. 427, 185 N.E. 657,
CONGRESS. In International Law. An assembly
of envoys, commissioners, deputies, etc., from dif-
ferent sovereignties who meet to concert measures
for their common good, or to adjust their mutual
concerns.
In American Law. The legislative assembly of
the United States, composed of the senate and
house of representatives (q. v.). U. S. Const. art.
1, § 1.

## CONGRESSMAN

Strictly, a member of the Con-

Connivance differs from condonation, though the same
legal consequences may attend it. Connivance necessarily
involves criminality on the part of the individual who con-
nives; condonation may take place without imputing the
slightest blame to the party who forgives the injury. Con-
nivance must be the act of the mind before the offense has
been committed; condonation is the result of a deter-
mination to forgive an injury which was not known until
after it was inflicted. Turton v. Turton, 3 Hagg.Eccl. 350.

direct line from the other, as between son, father,
grandfather, great-grandfather, and so upwards
in the direct ascending line; or between son,
grandson, great-grandson, and so downwards in
the direct descending line. Collateral consan-

## CONSCIENCE

The moral sense; the faculty of
judging the moral qualities of actions, or of dis-
criminating between right and wrong; particular.
ly applied to one's perception and judgment of
the moral qualities of his own conduct, but in a
wider sense, denoting a similar application of the
standards of morality to the acts of others. The
sense of right and wrong inherent in every person
by virtue of his existence as a social entity; good
conscience being a synonym of equity. Van Graa-
fieland v. Wright, 286 Mo. 414, 228 S.W. 465, 469.
In law, especially the moral rule which requires
probity, justice, and honest dealing between man
and man, as when we say that a bargain is
"against conscience" or "unconscionable," or that
the price paid for property at a forced sale was
so inadequate as to "shock the conscience." This
is also the meaning of the term as applied to the
jurisdiction and principles of decision of courts
of chancery, as in saying that such a court is a
"court of conscience," that it proceeds "according
to conscience," or that it has cognizance of "mat-
ters of conscience." See 3 Bl.Comm. 47-56;
People v. Stewart, 7 Cal. 143; Miller v. Miller,
187 Pa. 572, 41 A. 277.
As an element of equitable jurisdiction it is not the priv-
ate opinion of an individual court, but is rather to be re-
garded as a metaphorical term, designating the common
standard of civil right and expediency combined, based up-
on general principles and limited by established doctrines,
to which the court appeals and by which it tests the con-
duct and rights of suitors. National City Bank of New
York v. Gelfert, 284 N.Y. 13, 29 N.E.2d 449, 452.

## CONSCIENCE OF THE COURT

When an issue
is sent (Alt of chancery to be tried at law, to "in-
form the conscience of the court," the meaning
is that the court is to be supplied with exact and
dependable information as to the unsettled or
disputed questions of fact in the case, in order
that it may proceed to decide it in accordance
with the principles of equity and good conscience
in the light of the facts thus determined. Watt
v. Starke, 101 U.S. 252, 25 L.Ed. 826.

## CONSCIENCE, COURTS OF

ord, constituted by act of parliament in the city of

U.S.C.A. App., § 305(g). U. S. v. Kauten, C.C.A.
N.Y., 133 F.2d 703.
One conscientiously opposed on religious grounds to par-
ticipation in war need not be a member of a religious sect
whose creed forbids participation in war to be entitled to
classification as a conscientious objector. U. S. v. Bowles,
C.C.A.N.J., 131 F.2d 818. It is sufficient if he has a con-
scientious scruple against war in any form. U. S. ex rel.
Phillips v. Downer, C.C.A.N.Y., 135 F.2d 521, 524, 525.

## CONSCIENTIOUS SCRUPLE

A conscientious
scruple against taking an oath, serving as a juror
in a capital case, doing military duty, or the like,
is an objection or repugnance growing out of the
fact that the person believes the thing demanded
of him to be morally wrong, his conscience being
the sole guide to his decision; it is thus distin-
guished from an "objection on principle," which is
dictated by the reason and judgment, rather than
the moral sense, and may relate only to the pro-
priety or expediency of the thing in question.
People v. Stewart, 7 Cal. 143.

## CONSCRIPTION

Drafting into the military
service of the state; compulsory military service

"Consent" is an active acquiescence as distinguished
from "assent," meaning a silent acquiescence. People v.

the will, and submission under the influence of fear or ter-
ror cannot amount to real consent. Hallmark v. State, 22

of intelligence based on knowledge of its significance and
moral quality and there must be a choice between resist-
ance and assent. State v. Schwab, 109 Ohio St. 532, 143 N.
E. 29, 31. And if woman resists to the point where further
resistance would be useless or until her resistance is over-
come by force or violence, submission thereafter is not

Express or Implied Consent. Under motor ve-
hicle liability insurance law providing that policy
should cover any person responsible for operation

## CONSERVATOR

A guardian; protector; pre-
server.
"When any person having property shall be found to be
incapable of managing his affairs, by the court of probate
in the district in which he resides, * * * it shall appoint
some person to be his conservator, who, upon giving a pro-
bate bond, shall have the charge of the person and estate of
such incapable person." Gen.St.Conn.1875, p. 346, § 1
(Gen.St.1930, § 4815) ; Hutchins v. Johnson, 12 Conn. 376,
30 Am. Dec. 622.

## CONSERVATORS OF RIVERS

Commissioners
or trustees in whom the control of a certain river
is vested, in England, by act of parliament.

## CONSERVATORS OF THE PEACE

Officers au-
thorized to preserve and maintain the public peace.
In England, these officers were locally elected by
the people until the reign of Edward III, when
their appointment was vested in the king. Their
duties were to prevent and arrest for breaches of
the peace, but they had no power to arraign and
try the offender until about 1360, when this au-
thority was given to them by act of parliament,
and " ,then they acquired the more honorable appel-
lation of justices of the peace." 1 Bl.Comm. 351.
Even after this time, however, many public officers were
styled "conservators of the peace," not as a distinct office
but by virtue of the duties and authorities pertaining to
their offices. In this sense the term may include the king
himself, the lord chancellor, justices of the king's bench,
master of the rolls, coroners, sheriffs, constables, etc. 1
BI.Comm. 350. See Smith v. Abbott, 17 N.J.L. 358. In
Texas, the constitution provides that county judges shall
be conservators of the peace. Const.Tex. art. 4, § 15;
Jones v. State, Tex.Cr.App., 65 S.W. 92. The Constitution
of Delaware (1831) provides that: "The members of the
senate and house of representatives, the chancellor, the
judges, and the attorney-general shall, by virtue of their
offices, be conservators of the peace throughout the state;
and the treasurer, secretary, and prothonotaries, registers,
recorders, sheriffs, and coroners, shall, by virtue of their
offices, be conservators thereof within the counties respec-
tively in which they reside."
CONSERVE. To save from loss. U. S. v. Mam-
moth Oil Co., D.C.Wyo., 5 F.2d 330, 351.

## CONSIDER

careful examination; to examine; to inspect.

248, 123 Misc. 83. To deliberate about and ponder
over. People v. Tru-Sport Pub. Co., 291 N.Y.S. 449,
457, 160 Misc. 628. To entertain or give heed to.
Rodolf v. Board of Com'rs of Tulsa County, 122
Okl. 120, 251 P. 740, 741. See, also, Considered.

## CONSIDERABLE

Worthy of consideration; re-
quired to be observed. Gougar v. Buffalo Specialty
Co., 26 Colo.App. 8, 141 P. 511, 514.

sarily mean a very great or any particular number of per-
sons; the term "considerable" being merely relative.

E. 598, 599.

## CONSIDERATIO CURIAE

The judgment of the
court.

## CONSIDERATION

Practice. A technical term
indicating that a tribunal has heard and judicially
determined matters submitted to it. Meaney v.
State Industrial Accident Commission, 113 Or, 371,
232 P. 789, 791.
Contracts
The inducement to a contract. The cause, mo•
tive, price, or impelling influence which induces a
contracting party to enter into a contract. The
reason or material cause of a contract. 2 Bla.
Comm. 443; Cassinelli v. Stacy, 238 Ky. 827, 38
S.W.2d 980, 983.
Consideration is not to be confounded with motive. Con-
sideration means something which is of value in the eye
of the law, moving from the plaintiff, either of benefit to
the plaintiff or of detriment to the defendant. Patteson,
J., in Langd.Sel.Cas.Contr. 168; s. c. 2 Q.B. 851; Miller
v. Bank of Holly Springs, 131 Miss. 55, 95 So. 129, 130, 31
A.L.R. 698. "Nothing is consideration that is not regard-
ed as such by both parties." Schlecht v. Schlecht, 168
Minn. 168, 209 N.W. 883, 887. And "price" and "considera-
tion," though sometimes the same, are not always identi-
cal. Oregon Home Builders v. Crowley, 87 Or. 517, 170 P.
718, 721.
The "inducement" for a contract is that which influences
the act, while "consideration" means the parting with
something by the one from whom it moves. E. F. Spears
& Sons v. Winkle, 186 Ky. 585, 217 S.W. 691, 692.
An act or forbearance, or the promise thereof,
which is offered by one party to an agreement, and
accepted by the other as an inducement to that
other's act or promise. Poll.Contr. 91.
Any benefit conferred, or agreed to be conferred,
upon the promisor, by any other person, to which
the promisor is not lawfully entitled, or any preju-
dice suffered, or agreed to be suffered, by such
person, other than such as he is at the time of
consent lawfully bound to suffer, as an induce-
ment to the promisor. Hence doing only of what
one is already under obligation to do is not "con-
sideration" for a contract. Hogan v. Supreme
Camp of the American Woodmen, 146 Fla. 413, 1
So.2d 256, 258.
Any act of the plaintiff (or the promisee) from
which the defendant (the promisor) or a stranger
derives a benefit or advantage, or any labor, detri-
ment, Jar inconvenience sustained by the plaintiff,
however small, if such act is performed or incon-
venience suffered by the plaintiff by the consent,
express or implied, of the defendant. 3 Scott, 250.
A benefit to the promisor, or a loss or detriment to the
promisee. Harris v. Johnson, 75 Wash. 291, 134 P. 1048,
1050; Fowler v. Smith, 24 Ohio App. 324, 156 N.E. 913, 914.
Or benefit to a third party. Wellshire Land Co. v. City and
County of Denver, 103 Colo. 416, 87 P.2d 1. But nothing is
"consideration" that is not regarded as such by both par-
ties. Michael v. Holland, 111 Ind. App. 34, 40 N.E.2d 362,
Some right, interest, gain, advantage, benefit, or profit
to one party, usually the promisor, or some forbearance,
detriment, prejudice, inconvenience, disadvantage, loss, or
responsibility, act, or service given, suffered, or undertaken
by the promisee. Exum v. Lynch, 125 S.E. 15, 17, 188 N. C.
392; Furman University v. Waller, 117 S.E. 356, 358, 124 S.
C. 68, 33 A.L.R. 615; Robinson v. Oliver, 156 N.Y.S. 896,
898, 171 App. Div. 349; L.R. 10 Ex. 162; Train v. Gold, 5
Pick. (Mass.) 380; Bankers Trust Co. v. Economy Coal Co.,
224 Iowa 36, 276 N.W. 16, 20.

Executed or Executory Considerations. The
former are acts done or values given before or
at the time of making the contract; the latter
are promises to give or do something in future.
Express or Implied Considerations. The former
are those which are specifically stated in a deed,
contract, or other instrument; the latter are those
inferred or supposed by the law from the acts or
situation of the parties.

tinctly and specifically named in the written contract or
in the oral agreement of the parties.

119, 99 So. 846, 847. See, also, Berry v. Berry, 83
W.Va. 763, 99 S.E. 79.
Motives of natural duty, generosity, and prudence come
under this class. 2 Bla.Comm. 297; Doran v. McConlogue,
150 Pa. 98, 24 A. 357; Mascolo v. Montesanto, 61 Conn. 50,
23 A. 714, 29 Am.St.Rep. 170.
The term is sometimes used in the sense of a considera-
tion valid in point of law; and it then includes a valuable
or sufficient as well as a meritorious consideration. Hodg-
son v. Butts, 3 Cra. (U.S.) 140, 2 L. Ed. 391; Lang v.
Johnson, 24 N.H. 302; Ambl. 598. Generally, however,

founded upon any such loss, injury, or inconven-
ience to the party to whom it moves as to make it

Implied Considerations. See Express or Implied
Considerations, supra.
Impossible Consideration. One which cannot be

Inadequate Consideration. See that title.
Legal Consideration. One recognized or permit-
ted by the law as valid and lawful; as distin-

Brown, 88 Minn. 524, 93 N.W. 672, 60 L.R.A. 870.
Meritorious Consideration. See Good Considera-
tion.
Moral Considerations. See Equitable or Moral
Considerations, supra.
Nominal Consideration. One bearing no rela-
tion to the real value of the contract or article, as
where a parcel of land is described in a deed as
being sold for "one dollar," no actual consideration
passing, or the real consideration being concealed.
This term is also sometimes used as descriptive of
an inflated or exaggerated value placed upon prop-
erty for the purpose of an exchange. Boyd v. Wat-
son, 101 Iowa 214, 70 N.W. 123; Emmi v. Patane,
220 N.Y.S. 495, 498, 128 Misc. 901.
Past Consideration. An act done before the con-
tract is made, which is ordinarily by itself no con-
sideration for a promise. Anson, Cont. 82; Witt v.
Wilson, Tex.Civ.App., 160 S.W. 309, 310.
As to time, considerations may be of the past, present,
or future. Those which are present or future will support
a contract not void for other reasons. Story, Contr. 71.
Pecuniary Consideration. A consideration for
an act or forbearance which consists either in
money presently passing or in money to be paid in
the future, including a promise to pay a debt in

not so much the service resulting in the performance of
labor or the earning of wages as the service which con-
tributed aid and assistance in all the relations of domestic
life. Hinnant v. Tide Water Power Co., 189 N.C. 120, 126

stantially the same meaning, viz., the companion-
ship or society of a wife. 3 Bla.Comm. 140; Kel-
ley v. Railroad Co., 168 Mass. 308, 46 N.E. 1063,

inal or unlawful means to the commission of an

The essence of "conspiracy" is an agreement, together
with an overt act, to do an unlawful act, or do a lawful
act in an unlawful manner. Cooper v: O'Connor, 99 F.2d
135, 142, 69 App.D.C. 100, 118 A.L.R. 1440. Mere knowl-
edge, acquiescence, approval, or attempt on part of one to
perpetrate illegal act is insufficient. People v. Link, 365
Ill. 266, 6 N.E.2d 201.
A conspiracy may be a continuing one; actors may drop
out, and others drop in; the details of operation may
change from time to time; the members need nit know
each other or the part played by others; a member need
not know all the details of the plan or the operations; he
must, however, know the purpose of the conspiracy and
agree to become a party to a plan to effectuate that pur-
pose. Craig v. U. S., C.C.A.Cal., 81 F.2d 816, 822.

to prevent the course of justice; or to effect a legal pur-
pose with a corrupt intent, or by improper means. Hawk.

tions by journeymen to raise wages. State v. Murphy, 6
Ala. 765, 41 Am. Dec. 79.
Civil and Criminal Conspiracies
The term "civil" is used to designate a conspira-
cy which will furnish ground for a civil action,
as where, in carrying out the design of the con-
spirators, overt acts are done causing legal dam-
age, the person injured has a right of action. It
is said that the gist of civil conspiracy is the in-
jury or damage. While criminal conspiracy does
not require such overt acts, yet, so far as the
rights and remedies are concerned, all criminal
conspiracies are embraced within the civil con-
spiracies. Martha Mills v. Moseley, 50 Ga.App.
536, 179 S.E. 159.
Accurately speaking, there is no such thing as a civil ac-
tion for conspiracy. The better view is that the damage
sustained, and not the conspiracy is the gist of the action.
The combination may be of no consequence except as bear-
ing upon rules of evidence or the persons liable. Dahlquist
v. Mattson, 40 Idaho, 378, 233 P. 883, 885.
The essence of a "civil conspiracy" is a concert or com-
bination to defraud or cause other injury to person or prop-
erty, which results in damage to the person or property of
plaintiff. Conner v. Bryce, Sup., 170 N.Y.S. 94, 95.

Where two or more persons enter on a common enter-
prise or adventure and criminal offense is contemplated
each is a "conspirator". Kelly v. State, 31 Ala.App. 194,
13 So.2d 691, 692.
Those who bind themselves by oath, covenant, or other
alliance that each of them shall aid the other falsely and
maliciously to indict persons; or falsely to move and
are conspirators in treasonable purposes; as for plotting
against the government. Wharton.

## CONSPIRE

To engage in conspiracy. Wright v.
United States, C.C.A.La., 48 C.C.A. 37, 108 F. 805,
It carries with it the idea of agreement, concurrence and
combination, and hence is inapplicable to a single person
or thing, and one cannot agree or conspire with another.

larly used by a considerable number of persons at a par-

by the law) works no injury. Co. Litt. 183;
Broom, Max. 603. The law will make such a con-
struction of an instrument as not to injure a par-
ty.

## CONSTRUCTION

The process, or the art, of
determining the sense, real meaning, or proper
explanation of obscure or ambiguous terms or
provisions in a statute, written instrument, or oral
agreement, or the application of such subject to
the case in question, by reasoning in the light de-
rived from extraneous connected circumstances
or laws or writings bearing upon the same or a
connected matter, or by seeking and applying the
probable aim and purpose of the provision. Koy
v. Schneider, 110 Tex. 369, 221 S.W. 880, 884.
As applied to statutes, constitutions, contracts, etc., the
term necessarily presupposes doubt, obscurity, or ambigui-
ty. Cohn-Hall-Marx Co. v. Vanosdall, 25 Ohio App. 360, 157
N.E. 908, 909.
Drawing conclusions respecting subjects that
lie beyond the direct expression of the term. Lie-
ber, Leg. & Pol. Herm. 20; Roberts v. Portland
Water Dist., 124 Me. 63, 126 A. 162, 163.
This term is properly distinguished from interpretation,
although the two are often used synonymously. In strict-
ness, interpretation is limited to exploring the written text,
while construction goes beyond and may call in the aid of
extrinsic considerations, as above indicated.
The process of bringing together and correlat-
ing a number of independent entities, so as to
form a definite entity. The Dredge A, D.C.N.C.,
217 F. 617, 631.
The creation of something new, as distinguished
from the repair or improvement of something al-
ready existing. Cabell v. City of Portland, 153
Or. 528, 57 P.2d 1292, 1297. The act of fitting an
object for use or occupation in the usual way,
and for some distinct purpose. Paterson N. &
R. R. Co. v. City of Paterson, 81 N.J.Eq. 124, 86
A. 68, 69. See Construct.
Construction, court of. A court of equity or
of common law, as the case may be, is called the
court of construction with regard to wills, as op-
posed to the court of probate, whose duty is to de-
cide whether an instrument be a will at all. Now,
the court of probate may decide that a given in-
strument is a will, and yet the court of construc-
tion may decide that it has no operation, by rea-
son of perpetuities, illegality, uncertainty, etc.
Wharton.
Equitable construction. A construction of a
law, rule, or remedy which has regard more to
the equities of the particular transaction or state
of affairs involved than to the strict application
of the rule or remedy; that is, a liberal and ex-
tensive construction, as opposed to a literal and
restrictive. Smiley v. Sampson, 1 Neb. 91.
By "equity of a statute" is intended the rule of construc-
tion which admits within the operation of a statute a class
of cases which are neither named nor excluded, but which,
from their analogy to those that are named, are clearly
and justly within the spirit and general meaning of the
law; such cases are said to be "within the equity of the
statute."
The modern doctrine is that to construe a statute liberal-
ly or according to its equity is nothing more than to give
effect to it according to the intention of the lawmaker as
indicated by its terms and purposes. Read v. Dingess, C.
C.A.W.Va., 60 F. 21, 29, 8 C.C.A. 389.
Strict and liberal construction. Strict (or liter-
al) construction is construction of a statute .or
other instrument according to its letter, which
recognizes nothing that is not expressed, takes
the language used in its exact and technical mean-
ing, and admits no equitable considerations or
implications. Warner v. King, 267 Ill. 82, 107
N.E. 837, 839.
Liberal (or equitable) construction, on the other
hand, expands the meaning of the statute to meet
cases which are clearly within the spirit or rea-
son of the law, or within the evil which it was de-
signed to remedy, provided such an interpreta-
tion is not inconsistent with the language used;
it resolves all reasonable doubts in favor of the
applicability of the statute to the particular case.
Black, Interp.Laws, 282; Causey v. Guilford Coun-
ty, 192 N.C. 298, 135 S.E. 40, 46. It means, not
that the words should be forced out of their na-
tural meaning, but simply that they should re-
ceive a fair and reasonable interpretation with re-
spect to the objects and purposes of the instru-
ment. Lawrence v. McCalmont, 2 How. 426, 11
L.Ed. 326.

## CONSTRUCTIVE

That which is established by
the mind of the law in its act of construing facts,
conduct, circumstances, or instruments; that
which has not the character assigned to it in its
own essential nature, but acquires such charac-
ter in consequence of the way in which it is re-
garded by a rule or policy of law; hence, infer-
red, implied, made out by legal interpretation;—
the word "legal" being sometimes used in lieu
of "constructive." Middleton v. Parke, 3 App.D.
C. 160.
As to constructive "Bailment," "Breaking,"
"Contempt," "Contracts," "Conversion," "Deliv-
ery," "Escape," "Fraud," "Larceny," "Malice,"
"Notice," "Possession," "Seisin," "Service of Pro-
cess," "Total Loss," "Treason," and "Trusts," see
those titles.

## CONSTRUCTIVE ASSENT

sent imputed to a party from a construction or
interpretation of his conduct; as distinguished
from one which he actually expresses.

## CONSTRUCTIVE AUTHORITY

Authority in-
ferred or assumed to have been given because of
the grant of some other antecedent authority.
Middleton v. Parke, 3 App.D.C. 160.

A breaking made out by construction of law. As
where a burglar gains an entry into a house by
threats, fraud, or conspiracy. 2 Russ. Crimes, 9,
10; Hawkins v. Commonwealth, 284 Ky. 33, 143
S.W.2d 853, 854.

## CONSTRUCTIVE CRIME

Where, by a strained
construction of a penal statute, it is made to in-
clude an act not otherwise punishable, it is said
to be a "constructive crime," that is, one built up
by the court with the aid of inference and implica-
tion. Ex parte McNulty, 77 Cal. 164, 19 P. 237, 11
Am.St.Rep. 257.

## CONSTRUCTIVE EVICTION

As the term is
used with reference to breach of the covenants of
warranty and of quiet enjoyment, it means the in-
ability of the purchaser to obtain possession by
reason of a paramount outstanding title. Fritz v.
Pusey, 31 Minn. 368, 18 N.W. 94.
With reference to the relation of landlord and tenant,
there is a "constructive eviction" when the former, with-
out intent to oust the latter, does some act which deprives
the tenant of the beneficial enjoyment of the demised prem-
ises or materially impairs such enjoyment. Santrizos v.
Public Drug Co., 143 Minn. 222, 173 N.W. 563, 564. Any
disturbance of the tenant's possession by the landlord
whereby the premises are rendered unfit or unsuitable for
occupancy in whole or in substantial part for the purposes
for which they were leased amounts to a constructive evic-
tion, if the tenant so elects and surrenders his possession.
Murry v. Merchants' Southwest Transfer & Storage Co., 98
Okl. 270, 225 P. 547, 549. There must be injurious inter-
ference with tenant's possession, substantial deprivation of
tenant's beneficial use of premises, and material impair-
ment of tenant's beneficial enjoyment of premises, so that
he is compelled to vacate. Ben Hur Holding Corporation
v. Fox, 263 N.Y.S. 695, 147 Misc. 300.

## CONSTRUCTIVE FORCE

This has been said
to be an acquiescence to an act obtained through
duress or fear of personal violence. Shepherd v.
State, 135 Ala. 9, 12, 33 So. 266.
With regard to rape, the force necessary to con-
stitute the offense need not be actual, but may be
constructive or implied. 52 C.J. p. 1018.
As regards robbery, a taking by force is the
gist of the crime, but the force may be either ac-
tual or constructive. 54 C.J. p. 1016. " 'Construc-
tive force' is anything which produces fear suf-
ficient to suspend the power of resistance and pre-
vent the free exercise of the will." Montsdoca v.
State, 84 Fla. 82, 93 So. 157, 159, 27 A.L.R. 1291.
"Actual force is applied to the body, constructive
is by threatening words or gestures and operates
on the mind." Tones v. State, 48 Tex.Cr. 363, 88
S.W. 217, 122 Am.St.Rep. 759, 1 L.R.A.,N.S., 1024.

## CONSTRUCTIVE LOSS

One resulting from
such injuries to the property, without its destruc-
tion, as render it valueless to the assured or pre-
vent its restoration to the original condition except
at a cost exceeding its value.

## CONSTRUCTIVE MORTGAGE

A deed absolute
on its face but intended as a mortgage is some-
times referred to as a "constructive mortgage,"
or, more commonly perhaps, as an "equitable
mortgage." See Mortgage.

## CONSTRUCTIVE TAKING

A phrase used in
the law to characterize an act not amounting to
an actual appropriation of chattels, but which
shows an intention to convert them to his use; as
if a person intrusted with the possession of goods
deals with them contrary to the orders of the
owner.

## CONSTRUCTIVE VACANCY IN PUBLIC OF- FICE

When the incumbent has no legal right or
claim to continue in office, but can be legally re-
placed by another functionary. State ex rel. Sat-
terthwaite v. Stover, 5 W.W.Harr. 85, 159 A. 239,
CONSTRUCTIVE WILLFULNESS. Intentional
disregard of a known duty necessary to the safety
of a person, and an entire absence of care for the
life, the person, or the property of others, such
as exhibits a conscious indifference to consequenc-
es. Collins v. Missouri-Illinois R. Co., 233 Ill.

424, 13 N.E.2d 1015, 1018.

CONSUL.
International Law
An officer of a commercial character, appointed
by the different states to watch over the mer-
cantile interests of the appointing state and of
its subjects in foreign countries. There are
usually a number of consuls in every mari-
time country, and they are usually subject to a
chief consul, who is called a "consul general."
Schunior v. Russell, 18 S.W. 484, 83 Tex. 83.
Old English Law
An ancient title of an earl.
Roman Law
During the' republic, the name "consul" was
given to the chief executive magistrate, two of
whom were chosen annually. The office was con-
tinued under the empire, but its powers and pre-
rogatives were greatly reduced. The name is sup-
posed to have been derived from consulo, to con-
sult, because these officers consulted with the
senate on administrative measures.
The word "consul" has two meanings: (1) It denotes an
officer of a particular grade in the consular service; (2)
it has a broader generic sense, embracing all consular offi-
cers. Dainese v. U. S., 15 Ct.C1. 64.

sion or expectation of approaching dissolution;

condition or from some impending danger. As
applied to transfers of property, the phrase "in
contemplation of death" means that thought of
death is the impelling cause of transfer and that
motive which induces transfer is of sort which
leads to testamentary disposition and is practi-
cally equivalent to "causa mortis." In re Cornell's
Estate, 73 N.Y.S. 32, 66 App.Div. 162; Nicholas

administration of justice, or which is calculated
to lessen its authority or its dignity. Ex parte
Hobrook, 133 Me. 276, 177 A. 418, 420. Commit-
ted by a person who does any act in willful con-
travention of its authority or dignity, or tending
to impede or frustrate the administration of jus-
tice, or by one who, being under the court's au-
thority as a party to a proceeding therein, will-
fully disobeys its lawful orders or fails to com-
ply with an undertaking which he has given.
Snow v. Hawkes, 183 N.C. 365, 111 S.E. 621, 622,
23 A.L.R. 183.
Classification
Contempts are of two kinds, direct and con-
structive.
Direct contempts are those committed in the
immediate view and presence of the court (such
as insulting language or acts of violence) or so
near the presence of the court as to obstruct or
interrupt the due and orderly course of proceed-
ings. These are punishable summarily. They
are also called "criminal" contempts, but that
term is better used in contrast with "civil" con-
tempts. See infra. State v. McClaugherty, 33
W.Va. 250, 10 S.E. 407. Pelletier v. Glacier County,
Mont., 107 Mont. 221, 82 P.2d 595, 597.
Constructive (or indirect) contempts are those
which arise from matters not occurring in or near
the presence of the court, but which tend to ob-
struct or defeat the administration of justice,
and the term is chiefly used with reference to the
failure or refusal of a party to obey a lawful or-
der, injunction, or decree of the court laying upon
him a duty of action or forbearance. Maryott v.
Maryott, 124 Neb. 274, 246 N.W. 343.
Constructive contempts were formerly called "consequen-
tial," and this term is still in occasional use.
Contempts are also classed as civil or criminal.
The former are those quasi contempts which
consists in the failure to do something which the
party is ordered by the court to do for the bene-
fit or advantage of another party to the proceed-
ing before the court, while criminal contempts
process or which obstruct the administration of
justice or tend to bring the court into disrespect.
A civil contempt is not an offense against the dig-
nity of the court, but against the party in whose
behalf the mandate of the court was issued, and
a fine is imposed for his indemnity. But criminal
contempts are offenses or injuries offered to the
court, and a fine or imprisonment is imposed upon
the contemnor for the purpose of punishment.
Staley v. South Jersey Realty Co., 90 A. 1042, 1043,
83 N.J.Eq. 300, L.R.A.1917B, 113, Ann.Cas.1916E,
955; Fenton v. Walling, C.C.A.Cal., 139 F.2d 608,

## CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS, LEGISLATURE, or PARLIAMENT

Whatever obstructs or tends to
obstruct the due course of proceeding of either
house, or grossly reflects on the character of a
member of either house, or imputes to him what
it would be a libel to impute to an ordinary per-
son, is a contempt of the house, and thereby a
breach of privilege. Sweet.

acter, but comprising attack and defense as be-
; tween opposing parties, is so called. The litigious
proceedings in ecclesiastical courts are sometimes
said to belong to its "contentious" jurisdiction, in
contradistinction to what is called its "voluntary"
jurisdiction, which is exercised in the granting of
licenses, probates of wills, dispensations, facul-
ties, etc.

## CONTENTIOUS JURISDICTION

In English ec-
clesiastical law. That branch of the jurisdiction
of the ecclesiastical courts which is exercised upon
adversary or contentious (opposed, litigated) pro-
ceedings.

## CONTENTIOUS POSSESSION

In stating the
rule that the possession of land necessary to give
rise to a title by prescription must be a "conten-
tious" one, it is meant that it must be based on
opposition to the title of the rival claimant (not
in recognition thereof or subordination thereto)
and that the opposition must be based on good
grounds, or such as might be made the subject
of litigation. Railroad Co. v. McFarlan, 43 N.J.
L. 621.

## CONTENTMENT, CONTENEMENT

A man's
countenance or credit, which he has together with,
and by reason of, his freehold; or that which is
necessary for the support and maintenance of
men, agreeably to their several qualities or states
of life. Wharton; Cowell.
Comfort; consolation; ease; enjoyment; hap-
piness; pleasure; satisfaction. National Surety
Co. v. Jarrett, 95 W.Va. 420, 121 S.E. 291, 295.

"not" or "non contents" dissent. May, Parl. Law,
cc. 12, 357.

## CONTENTS UNKNOWN

Words sometimes an-
nexed to a bill of lading of goods in cases. Their
meaning is that the master only means to ac-
knowledge the shipment, in good order, of the cas-
es, as to their external condition. Miller v. Rail-
road Co., 90 N.Y. 433, 43 Am.Rep. 179.

## CONTERMINOUS

Adjacent; adjoining; having
a common boundary; coterminous.

## CONTEST

claim in a court of law; to oppose, resist, or dis-
pute the case made by a plaintiff. Pratt v. Breck-
inridge, 112 Ky. 1, 65 S.W. 136; Parks v. State,
100 Ala. 634, 13 So. 756. To strive, to win or hold;

§ 219.
In old English law. Coming to an issue; the
issue so produced. Crabb, Eng.Law, 216.

issue, there must be an affirmative on one side
and a negative on the other.

## CONTESTATION OF SUIT

In an ecclesiastical
cause, that stage of the suit which is reached
when the defendant has answered the libel by
giving in an allegation.

## CONTESTED ELECTION

This phrase has no
technical or legally defined meaning. An election
may be said to be contested whenever an objection
is formally urged against it which, if found to be
true in fact, would invalidate it. This is true both
as to objections founded upon some constitutional
provision and to such as are based on statutes.
Robertson v. State, 109 Ind. 116, 10 N.E. 600.

## CONTEXT

The context of a particular sentence

in some cases chosen by the legislative assemblies
in the states; in others by the people directly.
The powers of the congress were undefined, but
it proceeded to take measures and pass resolu-
tions which concerned the general welfare and
had regard to the inauguration and prosecution of
the war for independence. Black, Const.Law (3d
Ed.) 40; 1 Story, Const. §§ 198-217.

Vandegrift v. Riley, 30 P.2d 516, 523, 220 Cal.
340. A fortuitous event, which comes without de-
sign, foresight, or expectation. People v. Yonkers,
39 Barb. (N.Y.) 272; American Ins. Co. v. Black, 46
Ga.App. 471, 168 S.E. 85.

## CONTINGENCY OF A PROCESS

In Scotch law.
Where two or more processes are so connected
that the circumstances of the one are likely to
throw light on the others, the process first en-
rolled is considered as the leading process, and
brought in the same division, may be remitted to
it, ob contingentiam, on account of their nearness
or proximity in character to it. The effect of re-
mitting processes in this manner is merely to
bring them before the same division of the court
or same lord ordinary. In other respects they
remain distinct. Bell.

## CONTINGENCY WITH DOUBLE ASPECT

A re-
mainder is said to be "in a contingency with dou-
ble aspect," when there is another remainder limit-
ed on the same estate, not in derogation of the
first, but as a substitute for it in case it should fail.
Fearne, Rem. 373.
COlsITINGENT. Possible, but not assured; doubt-
ful or uncertain, conditioned upon the occurrence
of some future event which is itself uncertain, or
questionable. Verdier v. Roach, 96 Cal. 467, 31 P.

Edler, C.C.A.Nev., 78 F.2d 817, 819.
This term, when applied to a use, remainder, devise, be-
quest, or other legal right or interest, implies that no
present interest exists, and that whether such interest or
right ever will exist depends upon a future uncertain event.
Jemison v. Blowers, 5 Barb. (N.Y.) 692.
As to contingent "Damages," "Fee," "Legacy,"
"Limitation," "Remainder," "Trust," and "Use,"
see those titles.

crued and which is dependent on some future
event that may never happen. Hospes v. Car Co.,
48 Minn. 174, 50 N.W. 1117, 15 L.R.A. 470, 31 Am.
St.Rep. 637; Hicks v. Wilbur, 38 R.I. 268, 94 A. 872,

pality to pay expense items which will necessarily
arise during the year but cannot appropriately be
classified under any of the specific purposes for
which other taxes are levied. First Nat. Bank of
Norman v. City of Norman, 182 Okl. 7, 75 P.2d
1109, 1110.

## CONTINGENT INTEREST IN PERSONAL PROPERTY

A future interest not transmissible
to the representatives of the party entitled there-
to, in case he dies before it vests in possession.
Mozley & Whitley.
Thus, if a testator leaves the income of a fund to his
wife for life, and the capital of the fund to be distributed
among such of his children as shall be living at her death,
the interest of each child during the widow's life-time is
contingent, and in case of his death is not transmissible to
his representatives. Mozley & Whitley.

## CONTINGENT LIABILITY

One which is not
now fixed and absolute, but which will become
uncertain event. Warren Co. v. C. I. R., C.C.A.
Ga., 135 F.2d 679, 684, 685.

## CONTINUAL CLAIM

In old English law. A for-
mal claim made by a party entitled to enter upon
any lands or tenements, but deterred from such
entry by menaces, or bodily fear, for the purpose
of preserving or keeping alive his right. It was
called "continual," because it was required to be
repeated once in the space of every year and day.
It had to be made as near to the land as the party
could approach with safety, and, when made in
due form, had the same effect with, and in all re-
spects amounted to, a legal entry. Litt. §§ 419-
423; Co.Litt. 250a; 3 Bl.Comm. 175.

## CONTINUANCE

The adjournment or postpone-
ment of an action pending in a court, to a subse-
quent day of the same or another term. Com. v.

Brueckl, 332 Mo. 892, 17 S.W.2d 524, 527.
Also the entry of a continuance made upon the
record of the court, for the purpose of formally
evidencing the postponement, or of connecting
the parts of the record so as to make one continu-
ous whole.

## CONTINUANDO

In pleading. A form of alle-
gation in which the trespass, criminal offense, or
other wrongful act complained of is charged to
have been committed on a specified day and to
have "continued" to the present time, or is averred
to have been committed at divers days and times
within a given period or on a specified day and on
divers other days and times between that day and
another. This is called "laying the time with a
continuando." State v. Brown, 10 Okl.Cr. 52, 133
P. 1143, 1144.

## CONTINUING

Enduring; not terminated by a
single act or fact; subsisting for a definite period
or intended to cover or apply to successive similar
obligations or occurrences.

peated intervals, so as to be of repeated occur-
rence; not necessarily an injury that never ceases.
Wood v. Sutcliffe, 8 Eng.Law & Eq. 217.

## CONTINUOUSLY

Uninterruptedly; in unbroken
sequence; without intermission or cessation;
without intervening time; with continuity or con-
tinuation. U. S. v. Wooten, C.C.A.N.M., 40 F.2d
882, 887.

## CONTIONES

people. Launspach, State and Family in Early
Rome 69.

## CONTRA

Against, confronting, opposite to; on
the other hand; on the contrary.
The word is used in many Latin phrases, as appears by
the following titles. In the books of reports, contra, ap-
pended to the name of a judge or counsel, indicates that
he held a view of the matter in argument contrary to that
next before advanced. Also, after citation of cases in sup-
port of a position, contra is often prefixed to citations of
cases opposed to it.

## CONTRA BONOS MORES

Against good morals.
Contracts contra bonos mores are void.

## CONTRA FORMAM COLLATIONIS

In old Eng-
lish law. A writ that issued where lands given in
perpetual alms to lay houses of religion, or to an

## CONTRA PACEM

Against the peace. A phrase
used in the Latin forms of indictments, and also
of actions for trespass, to signify that the offense
alleged was committed against the public peace,
1. e., involved a breach of the peace. The full for-
mula was contra pacem domini regis, against the
peace of the lord the king. In modern pleading, in
this country, the phrase "against the peace of the
commonwealth" or "of the people" is used.

## CONTRA PROFERENTEM

The Peterhoff, 5 Wall. 58, 18 L.Ed. 564; Richard-
son v. Insurance Co., 6 Mass. 114, 4 Am.Dec. 92.
A recent American author on international law says that,
"by the term 'contraband of war,' we now understand a
class of articles of commerce which neutrals are prohibited
from furnishing to either one of the belligerents, for the
reason that, by so doing, injury is done to the other bellig-
erent;" and he treats of the subject, chiefly, in its relation
to commerce upon the high seas. Hall, Int.Law, 570, 592;
Elrod v. Alexander, 4 Heisk. (Tenn.) 345.

442; 2 Kent, Comm. 449. Justice v. Lang, 42 N.Y.
496, 1 Am.Rep. 576; Rabon v. State Finance Cor-
poration, 203 S.C. 183, 26 S.E.2d 501, 502.
An agreement between two or more parties, preliminary
Step in making of which is offer by one and acceptance by
other, in which minds of parties meet and concur in under-
standing of terms. Lee v. Travelers' Ins. Co. of Hartford,
Conn., 173 S.C. 185, 175 S.E. 429.
A deliberate engagement between competent parties, up-
on a legal consideration, to do, or abstain from doing,
some act. Wharton; Smith v. Thornhill, Tex.Com.App. 25
S.W.2d 597, 599.
It is agreement creating obligation, in which there must
be competent parties, subject-matter, legal consideration,
mutuality of agreement, and mutuality of obligation, and
agreement must not be so vague or uncertain that terms
are not ascertainable. H. Liebes & Co. v. Klengenberg, C.
C.A.Cal., 23 F.2d 611, 612.
A contract or agreement is either where a promise is
made on one side and assented to on the other; or where
two or more persons enter into engagement with each
other by a promise on either side. 2 Steph.Comm. 54.
The writing which contains the agreement of
parties, with the terms and conditions, and which
serves as a proof of the obligation.
Certain and Hazardous
Certain contracts are those in which the thing to
be done is supposed to depend on the will of the
party, or when, in the usual course of events, it
must happen in the manner stipulated. Hazardous
contracts are those in which the performance of
that which is one of its objects depends on an un-
certain event. Civ.Code La. 1776.
Classification
Contracts may be classified on several different
methods, according to the element in them which
is brought into prominence. The usual classifica-
tions are as follows:
Commutative and Independent
Commutative contracts are those in which what
is done, given, or promised by one party is consid-
ered as an equivalent to or in consideration of
what is done, given, or promised by the other.
Civ.Code La. 1768; Ridings v. Johnson, 9 Sup.Ct.
72, 128 U.S. 212, 32 L.Ed. 401. Independent con-
tracts are those in which the mutual acts or prom-
ises have no relation to each other, either as
equivalents or as considerations. Civ.Code La.
Conditional Contract
An executory contract the performance of which
depends upon a condition. It is not simply an
executory contract, since the latter may be an ab-
solute agreement to do or not to do something,
but it is a contract whose very existence and per-
formance depend upon a contingency. Railroad
Co. v. Jones, 2 Cold. (Tenn.) 584; French v. Os-
mer, 67 Vt. 427, 32 A. 254.
Consensual and Real
Consensual contracts are such as are founded
upon and completed by the mere agreement of the
contracting parties, without atry external formali-
ty or symbolic act to fix the obligation. Real con-
tracts are those in which it is necessary that there
should be something more than mere consent,
such as a loan of money, deposit or pledge, which,
from their nature, require a delivery of the thing,
(res.) Inst. 3, 14, 2; Id. 3, 15; Halifax, Civil Law,
b. 2, c. 15, No. 1. In the common law a contract
respecting real property (such as a lease of land
for years) is, called a "real" contract. 3 Coke,
22a.
Constructive Contract
Constructive contracts are such as arise when
the law prescribes the rights and liabilities of per-
sons who have not in reality entered into a con-
tract at all, but between whom circumstances
make it just that one should have a right, and the
other be subject to a liability, similar to the rights
and liabilities in cases of express contract. Dono-
van v. Kansas City, 352 Mo. 430, 175 S.W.2d 874,
Divisible and Indivisible
The effect of the breach of a contract depends
in a large degree upon whether it is to be regarded
as indivisible or divisible; i. e. whether it forms a
whole, the performance of every part of which is
a condition precedent to bind the other party, or
is composed of several independent parts, the
performance of any one of which will bind the
other party pro tanto. The only test is whether
the whole quantity of the things concerned, or
the sum of the acts to be done, is of the essence of
the contract. It depends, therefore, in the last
resort, simply upon the intention of the parties.
Integrity Flooring v. Zandon Corporation, 130
N.J.L. 244, 32 A.2d 507, 509.
When a consideration is entire and indivisible,
and it is against law, the contract is void in toto.
Frazier v. Thompson, 2 Watts & S. (Pa.) 235.
When the consideration is divisible, and part of it
is illegal, the contract is void only pro tanto.
Harr.Contr. 132; Gelpcke v. Dubuque, 1 Wall. 220,
17 L.Ed. 530.
Entire and Severable
An entire contract is one the consideration of
which is entire on both sides. The entire fulfill-
ment of the promise by either is a condition preced-
ent to the fulfillment of any part of the promise
by the other. Whenever, therefore, there is a
contract to pay the gross sum for a certain and
definite consideration, the contract is entire. A
severable contract is one the consideration of
which is, by its terms, susceptible of apportion-
ment on either side, so as to correspond to the un-
ascertained consideration on the other side, as a
contract to pay a person the worth of his services
so long as he will do certain work; or to give a
certain price for every bushel of so much corn as
corresponds to a sample. Orenstein v. Kahn, 13
Del.Ch. 376, 119 A. 444, 446; Integrity Flooring v.
Zandon Corporation, 130 N.J.L. 244, 32 A.2d 507,
509; Ruby v. United Sugar Cos., 56 Ariz. 535, 109
P.2d 845, 848.
Where a contract consists of many parts; which may be
considered as parts of one whole, the contract is entire.
When the parts may be considered as so many distinct con-
tracts, entered into at one time, and expressed in the same
instrument, but not thereby made one contract, the con-
tract is a separable contract. But, if the consideration of
the contract is single and entire, the contract must be held
to be entire, although the subject of the contract may con-
sist of several distinct and wholly independent items. 2
Pars.Cont. 517.
Executed and Executory
Contracts are also distinguished into executed
and executory; executed, where nothing remains
to be done by either party, and where the transac-
tion is completed at the moment that the arrange-
ment is made, as where an article is sold and de-
livered, and payment therefor is made on the spot;
executory, where some future act is to be done,
as where an agreement is made to build a house
in six months, or to do an act on or before some
future day, or to lend money upon a certain inter-
est, payable at a future time. Farrington v. Ten-
nessee, 95 U.S. 683, 24 L.Ed. 558; Fox v. Kitton,
19 Ill. 532; Mather v. Mather, 25 Ca1.2d 582, 154
P.2d 684, 686.
But executed contracts are not properly contracts at all,
except reminiscently. The term denotes rights in property
which have been acquired by means of contract; but the
parties are no longer bound by a contractual tie. Mettel
v. Gales, 12 S.D. 632, 82 N.W. 181.
Express and Implied
An express contract is an actual agreement of
the parties, the terms of which are openly uttered
or declared at the time of making it, being stated
in distinct and explicit language, either orally or
in writing. 2 Bl.Comm. 443; 2 Kent, Comm. 450;
Linn v. Ross, 10 Ohio 414, 36 Am.Dec. 95; A. J.
Yawger & Co. v. Joseph, 184 Ind. 228; 108 N.E.
774, 775; In re Pierce, Butler & Pierce Mfg. Co.,
D.C.N.Y., 231 F. 312, 318.
An implied contract is one not created or evi-
denced by the explicit agreement of the parties,
but inferred by the law, as a matter of reason and
justice from their acts or conduct, the circum-
stances surrounding the transaction making it a
reasonable, or even a necessary, assumption that a
contract existed between them by tacit understand-
ing. Miller's Appeal, 100 Pa. 568, 45 Am.Rep. 394;
Landon v. Kansas City Gas Co., C.C.A.Kan., 10
F.2d 263, 266; Caldwell v. Missouri State Life Ins.
Co., 230 S.W. 566, 568, 148 Ark. 474; Cameron, to
Use of Cameron, v. Eynon, 332 Pa. 529, 3 A.2d 423,
424; American La France Fire Engine Co., to Use

Borough of Shenandoah, C.C.A.Pa., 115 F.2d 806,
Implied contracts are sometimes subdivided into those
"implied in fact" and those "implied in law," the former
being covered by the definition just given, while the latter
are obligations imposed upon a person by the law, not in
pursuance of his intention and agreement, either expressed
the circumstances between the parties are such as to ren-.
der it just that the one should have a right, and the other
a corresponding liability, similar to those which would
arise from a contract between them. This kind of obliga-
tion therefore rests on the principle that whatsoever it is
certain a man ought to do that the law will suppose him to
have promised to do. And hence it is said that, while the
liability of a party to an express contract arises directly
from the contract, it is just the reverse in the case of a
contract "implied in law," the contract there being im-
plied or arising from the liability. Bliss v. Hoyt, 70 Vt.
534, 41 A. 1026; Kellum v. Browning's Adm'r, 231 Ky. 308,
21 S.W.2d 459, 465. But obligations of this kind are not
properly contracts at all, and should not be so denominat-
ed. There can be no true contract without a mutual and
concurrent intention of the parties. Such obligations are
more properly described as "quasi contracts." Union Life
Ins. Co. v. Glasscock, 270 Ky. 750, 110 S.W.2d 681, 686, 114
A. L.R. 373.
Fair and Reasonable Contract
See Fair and Reasonable Contract.
Gratuitous and Onerous
Gratuitous contracts are those of which the ob-
ject is the benefit of the person with whom it is
made, without any profit or advantage received or
promised as a consideration for it. It is not, how-
ever, the less gratuitous if it proceed either from
gratitude for a benefit before received or from the
hope of receiving one thereafter, although such
benefit be of a pecuniary nature. Onerous con-
tracts are those in which something is given or
promised as a consideration for the engagement
or gift, or some service, interest, or condition is im-
posed on what is given or promised, although un-
equal to it in value. Civ.Code La.1773, 1774; Peni-
tentiary Co. v. Nelms, 65 Ga. 505, 38 Am.Rep. 793.
A gratuitous contract is sometimes called a con-
tract of beneficence. Howe, Studies in the Civil
Law 107.
Joint and Several
A joint contract is one made by two or more
promisors, who are jointly bound to fulfill its
obligations, or made to two or more promisees,
who are jointly entitled to require performance of
the same. A contract may be "several" as to any
one of several promisors or promisees, if he has a
legal right (either from the terms of the agree-
ment or the nature of the undertaking) to enforce
his individual interest separately from the other
parties. Jens-Marie Oil Co. v. Rixse, 72 Okl. 93,
178 P. 658. Generally all contracts are joint
where the interest of the parties for whose benefit
they are created is joint, and separate where that
interest is separate. Shurtleff v. Udall, 97 Vt. 156,
122 A. 465, 468.
Mutual Interest, Mixed, etc.
Contracts of "mutual interest" are such as are
entered into for the reciprocal interest and utility
of each of the parties; as sales, exchange, part-
nership, and the like. "Mixed" contracts are
those by which one of the parties confers a benefit
on the other, receiving something of inferior value
in return, such as a donation subject to a charge.
Contracts "of beneficence" are those by which only
one of the contracting parties is benefited; as
Parol
A contract not entirely in writing. Louisville,
N. A. and C. Ry. Co. v. Reynolds, 118 Ind. 170,
173, 20 N.E. 711.
A written contract, which leaves some essential term
thereof to be shown by parol, is only "parol contract" not
enforceable under statute of fraud. Sheldmyer v. Bias, 112
Ind.App. 522, 45 N.E.2d 347, 349.
Personal Contract
A contract relating to personal property, or
one which so far involves the element of personal
knowledge or skill or personal confidence that it
can be performed only by the person with whom
made, and therefore is not binding on his execu-
tor. See Janin v. Browne, 59 Cal. 44; Lucas v.
J. H. Gross Motor Car Co., 27 Ohio App. 183, 161
N.E. 362, 363.
Pre-contract
An obligation growing out of a contract or con-
tractual relation, of such a nature that it debars
the party from legally entering into a similar con-
tract at a later time with any other person; par-
ticularly applied to marriage.
Principal and Accessory
A principal contract is one entered into by both
parties on their own account or in the several
qualities they assume. It is one which stands by
itself, justifies its own existence, and is not sub-
ordinate or auxiliary to any other. Accessory
contracts are those made for assuring the per-
formance of a prior contract, either by the same
parties or by others, such as suretyship, mortgage,
and pledge. Civ.Code La. art. 1771.
Quasi Contracts
In the civil law. A contractual relation aris-
ing out of transactions between the parties which
give them mutual rights and obligations, but do
not involve a specific and express convention or
agreement between them. Keener, Quasi Contr.
1; Elbert County v. Brown, 16 Ga.App. 834, 86
S.E. 651, 665. The lawful and purely voluntary
acts of a man, from which there results any ob-
ligation whatever to a third person, and some-
times a reciprocal obligation between the parties.
Civ. Code La. art. 2293.
Persons who have not contracted with each other are
often regarded by the Roman law, under a certain state
of facts, as if they had actually concluded a convention be-
tween themselves. The legal relation which then takes
place between these persons, which has always a similarity
to a contract obligation, is therefore termed "obligatio
quasi ex contractu." Such a relation arises from the con-
ducting of affairs without authority, (negotiorum gestio,)
from the payment of what was not due, (solutio indebiti,)
from tutorship and curatorship, and from taking possession
of an inheritance. Mackeld.Rom.Law § 491.
Legal fiction invented by common law courts
to permit recovery by contractual remedy of
assumpsit in cases where, in fact, there is no con-
tract, but where circumstances are such that jus-
tice warrants a recovery as though there had been
a promise. Clark v. Peoples Savings and Loan
Ass'n of De Kalb County, 221 Ind. 168, 46 N.E.2d
tion or consent of the parties, but Is founded on
considerations of justice and equity, and on doc-
trine of unjust enrichment. Bruggeman v. Inde-
pendent School Dist., No. 4, Union Tp., Mitchell
County, 227 Iowa 661, 289 N.W. 5, 8, 11.
It is not in fact a contract, but an obligation which the
law creates in absence of any agreement, when and because
the acts of the parties or others have placed in the posses-
sion of one person money, or its equivalent, under such
circumstances that in equity and good conscience he ought
not to retain it. Grossbier v. Chicago, St. P., M. & 0.
Ry. Co., 173 Wis. 503, 181 N.W. 746, 748; It is an implica-
tion of law. First Nat. Bank v. Matlock, 99 Okl. 150, 226
P. 328, 331, 36 A.L.R. 1088; Caldwell v. Missouri State
Life Ins. Co., 148 Ark. 474, 230 S.W. 566, 568.
It is what was formerly known as the contract implied
in law; it has no reference to the intentions or expres-
sions of the parties. The obligation is imposed despite,
and frequently in frustration of their intention. Town of
Balkan v. Village of Buhl, 158 Minn. 271, 197 N.W. 266, 35
A. L. R. 470.
Record, Specialty, Simple
Contracts of record are such as are declared
and adjudicated by courts of competent jurisdic-
tion, or entered on their records, including judg-
ments, recognizances, and statutes staple. Harde-
man v. Downer, 39 Ga. 425. These are not prop-
erly speaking contracts at all, though they may
be enforced by action like contracts. Specialties,
or special contracts, are contracts under seal, such
as deeds and bonds. Ludwig v. Bungart, 26 Misc.
Rep. 247, 56 N.Y.S. 51. All others are included in
the description "simple" contracts; that is, a
simple contract is one that is not a contract of
record and not under seal; it may be either writ-
ten or oral, in either case, it is called a "parol"
contract, the distinguishing feature being the lack
of a seal. Stackpole v. Arnold, 11 Mass. 30, 6 Am.
Dec. 150; 4 B. & Ald. 588; 2 Bla.Comm. 472.
Special Contract
A contract under seal; a specialty; as distin-
guished from one merely oral or in writing not
sealed. But in common usage this term is often
used to denote an express or explicit contract, one
which clearly defines and settles the reciprocal
rights and obligations of the parties, as distin-
guished from one which must be made out, and its
terms ascertained, by the inference of the law
from the nature and circumstances of the transac-
tion.
A special contract may rest in parol, and does not mean
a contract by specialty; it is defined as one with peculiar
provisions not found in the ordinary contracts relating to
the same subject-matter. Midland Roofing Mfg. Co. v.
Pickens, 96 S.C. 286, 80 S.E. 484, 485.
Subcontract
A contract subordinate to another contract,
made or intended to be made between the con-
tracting parties, on one part, or some of them,
and a stranger. 1 H.B1. 37, 45. One made under
a prior contract. Mobley v. Leeper Bros. Lumber
Co., 89 Okl. 95, 214 P. 174, 175.
Where 'a person has contracted for the performance of
certain work (e. g., to build a house,) and he in turn en-
gages a third party to perform the whole or a part of that
which is included in the original contract, (e. g., to do the
carpenter work,) his agreement with such third person is
contractor." Central Trust Co. v. Railroad Co., C.C.Ky.,
54 F. 723 Lester v. Houston, 101 N.C. 605, 8 S.E. 366. The
term "subcontractor" means one who has contracted with
the original contractor for the performance of all or a
part of the work or services which such contractor has
himself contracted to perform. Republic Supply Co. v.
Allen, Tex.Civ.App., 262 S.W. 113, 114.
Unconscionable Contract
One which no sensible man not under delusion,
duress, or in distress would make, and such as
no honest and fair man would accept. Franklin
Fire Ins. Co. v. Noll, 115 Ind.App. 289, 58 N.E.2d
947, 949, 950.
Unilateral and Bilateral
A unilateral contract is one in which one party
makes an express engagement or undertakes a
performance, without receiving in return any ex-
press engagement or promise of performance
from the other. Bilateral (or reciprocal) con-
tracts are those by which the parties expressly
enter into mutual engagements, such as sale or
hire. Civ. Code La. art. 1765; Poth. Obl. 1, 1, 1,
2; Kling Bros. Engineering Works v. Whiting
Corporation, 320 Ill.App. 630, 51 N.E.2d 1004, 1007.
When the party to whom an engagement is made
makes no express agreement on his part, the con-
tract is called unilateral, even in cases where the
law attaches certain obligations to his acceptance.
La. Civ. Code, art. 1765. A contract is also said
to be "unilateral" when there is a promise on one
side only, the consideration on the other side being
executed. McMahan v. McMahon, 122 S.C. 336,
115 S.E. 293, 294, 26 A.L.R. 1295.
Usurious Contract
See that title.
Written Contract
A "written contract" is one which in all its terms
is in writing. Fey v. Loose-Wiles Biscuit Co., 147
Kan. 31, 75 P.2d 810, 813; and instrument signed
by one party is orally accepted by other, Reeves
Furniture Co. v. Simms, Tex.Civ.App., 59 S.W.2d
262, 263.

## CONTRACT, ESTOPPEL BY

There are two
sorts of "estoppel by contract," estoppel to deny
truth of facts agreed on and settled by force of
entering into contract, and estoppel arising from
acts done under or in performance of contract.
In re Schofield's Estate, 101 Colo. 443, 73 P.2d 1381.
Finch v. Smith, 177 Okl. 307, 58 P.2d 850, 851.
"Estoppel by contract" is intended to embrace all cases
in which there is an actual or virtual undertaking to treat
a fact as settled. Jackson v. United Gas Public Service Co.,
198 So. 633, 640, 196 La. 1. It means party is bound by
terms of own contract until set aside or annulled for fraud,
accident, or mistake. United Fidelity Life Ins. Co. v.
Fowler, Tex.Civ.App., 38 S.W.2d 128, 131.

## CONTRACT OF BENEVOLENCE

A contract
made for the benefit of one of the contracting
parties only, as a mandate or deposit.

## CONTRACT OF RECORD

A contract of record
is one which has been declared and adjudicated
by a court having jurisdiction, or which is entered
of record in obedience to, or in carrying out, the
judgments of a court.

## CONTRACT OF SALE

A contract by which one
of the contracting parties, called the "seller," en-
ters into an obligation to the other to cause him
to have freely, by a title of proprietor, a thing,
for the price of a certain sum of money, which
the other contracting party, called the "buyer,"
on his part obliges himself to pay. Topzant v.
Koshe, 242 Wis. 585, 9 N.W.2d 136, 138.

## CONTRACT SYSTEM

As applied to state pris-
ons, this phrase signifies that the labor of the
prisoners is utilized by private persons or con-
tractors, who thus secure the profits of such labor.
People v. Hawkins, 157 N.Y. 1, 51 N.E. 257, 260, 42
L.R.A. 490, 68 Am.St.Rep. 736.

## CONTRACTION

Abbreviation; abridgment or
shortening of a word by omitting a letter or let-
ters or a syllable, with a mark over the place
where the elision occurs. This was customary in
records written in the ancient "court hand," and
is frequently found in the books printed in black-
letter.

## CONTRACTOR

This term is strictly applicable
to any person who enters into a contract (Kent v.
Railroad Co., 12 N.Y. 628), but is commonly re-
served to designate one who, for a fixed price,
undertakes to procure the performance of works
on a large scale, or the furnishing of goods in
large quantities, whether for the public or a com-
pany or individual. McCarthy v. Second Parish,
71 Me. 318, 36 Am.Rep. 320.
One who in pursuit of independent business
undertakes to perform a job or piece of work, re-
taining in himself control of means, method and
manner of accomplishing the desired result. Mar-
ion Malleable Iron Works v. Baldwin, 82 Ind.App.
206, 145 N.E. 559, 560.

## CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION

The obligation
which arises from a contract or agreement.

## CONTRACTUS

Lat. Contract; a contract; con-
tracts.
CONTRACTUS BONZE FIDEL In Roman law.
Contracts of good faith. Those contracts which,
when brought into litigation, were not determined
by the rules of the strict law alone, but allowed
the judge to examine into the bona fides of the
transaction, and to hear equitable considerations
against their enforcement. In this they were op-
posed to contracts stricti juris, against which
equitable defenses could not be entertained.

## CONTRACTUS CIVILES

In Roman law. Civil
contracts. Those contracts which were recognized
as actionable by the strict civil law of Rome, or
as being founded upon a particular statute, as
distinguished from those which could not be en-
forced in the courts except by the aid of the
praetor, who, through his equitable powers, gave
an action upon them. The latter were called
"contractus prcetorii."

law. Touching; handling; meddling. The act of
removing a thing from its place in such a man-
ner that, if the thing be not restored, it will
amount to theft.
CONTRECTATIO REI ALIENZE, ANIMO FUR-

touching or removing of another's property, with
an intention of stealing, is theft.

## CONTREFACON

In French law. The offense
of printing or causing to be printed a book, the
copyright of which is held by another, without au-
thority from him. Merl. Repert.

## CONTRE-MAITRE

In French marine law. The
chief officer of a vessel, who, in case of the sick-
ness or absence of the master, commanded in his
place. Literally, the countermaster.

## CONTRIBUTE

To lend assistance or aid, or give

requisites of a contract, but which did not give
rise to an action, nor receive the sanction of the
law, as bearing an "obligation," until thQ objec-
tive requisite of a solemn ceremonial, (such as
stipulatio) was supplied. In other words, con-
vention was the informal agreement of the par-
ties, which formed the basis of a contract, and
which became a contract when the external for-
malities were superimposed. See Maine, Anc.
Law, 313.
"The division of conventions into contracts and pacts was
important in the Roman law. The former were such con-
ventions as already, by the older civil law, founded an obli-
gation and action; all the other conventions were termed
obligation. Actionability was subsequently given to several
pacts, whereby they received the same power and efficacy
that contracts received." Mackeld.Rom.Law, § 395.
In legislation. An assembly of delegates or
representatives chosen by the people for special
and extraordinary legislative purposes, such as
the framing or revision of a state constitution.
Also an assembly of delegates chosen by a pol-
itical party, or by the party organization in a larg-
er or smaller territory, to nominate candidates for
an approaching election. In re Opinion of the
Justices, 132 Me. 491, 167 A. 176, 179.
In public and international law. A pact or
agreement between states or nations in the na-
ture of a treaty; usually applied (a) to agree-
ments or arrangements preliminary to a formal
treaty or to serve as its basis, or (b) internation-
al agreements for the regulation of matters of
common interest but not coming within the sphere
of politics or commercial intercourse, such as in-
ternational postage or the protection of submar-
ine cables. U. S. v. Hunter, C.C.Mo., 21 F. 615..
Constitutional convention. See Constitution..
Judicial convention. See Judicial,
CONVENTIONAL. Depending on, or arising
from, the mutual agreement of parties; as dis-
tinguished from legal, which means created by,
or arising from, the act of the law. De Vita Nr&
Pianisani, 217 N.Y.S. 438, 440, 127 Misc. 611.

gage," "Subrogation," and "Trustees," see those ti-
tles.

where the lien, general or particular (Cro. Car.
271; 6 Term. 14; 2 Kent 637) is raised by the ex-

in circumstances where the law alone would not
create a lien from the mere relation of the par-
ties or the details of their transaction.

ing together of people; a crowd assembled for
any purpose; also a convention, pact, or bargain.

species of slander or injury uttered in public, and
which charged some one with some act contra
bonos mores.

## CONVICT

To condemn after judicial investi-
gation; to find a man guilty of a criminal charge.
The word was formerly used also in the sense of
finding against the defendant in a civil case.
Formerly a man was said to be convict when he had been
found guilty of treason or felony, but before judgment had
been passed on him, after which he was said to be attaint,
(q. v.). Co.Litt. 390b.

## CONVICT

One who has been finally condemn-
ed by a court. One who has been adjudged guilty
of a crime or misdemeanor. Usually spoken of
condemned felons or the prisoners in penitentiar-
ies. Molineux v. Collins, 177 N.Y. 395, 69 N.E. 727,
65 L.R.A. 104.

## CONVICTED

Means that a judgment of final
condemnation has been pronounced against the
accused. Gallagher v. State, 10 Tex.App. 469;
Neibling v. Terry, 177 S.W.2d 502, 504, 352 Mo.
396, 152 A.L.R. 249.

## CONVICTION

In a general sense, the result of
a criminal trial which ends in a judgment or sen-
tence that the prisoner is guilty as charged.
,
The act of convicting a person, or state of being con-
victed, of a criminal offense. Hershey v. People, 91 Colo.
113, 12 P.2d 345, 347. Finding a person guilty by verdict
of a jury. 1 Bish.Crim.Law, § 223; Emmertson v. State
Tax Commission of Utah, 93 Utah 219, 72 P.2d 467, 470,
113 A.L.R. 1174.
A record of the summary proceedings upon any
penal statute before one or more justices of the
peace or other persons duly authorized, in a case
where the offender has been convicted and sen-
tenced., Holthouse. In respect of pardoning pow-
er, verdict of guilty. State v. Garrett, 135 Tenn.
617, 188 S.W. 58, L.R.A.1917B, 567. Contra, Ex
parte White, 28 Okl.Cr, 180, 230 P. 522.
In ordinary phrase, the meaning of the word "convic-
tion" is the finding by the jury of a verdict that the
accused is guilty. But, in legal parlance, it often denotes
the final judgment of the court. Blaufus v. People, 69 N.Y.
109, 25 Am.Rep. 148; Marino v. Hibbard, 243 Mass. 90, 137
N.E. 369; Commonwealth v. Minnich, 250 Pa. 363, 95 A.
565, 567, L.R.A.1916B, 950.
The ordinary legal meaning of "conviction," when used
to designate a particular stage of a criminal prosecution
triable by a jury, is the confession of the accused in open
court or the verdict returned against him by the jury,
which ascertains and publishes the fact of his guilt; while
"judgment" or "sentence" is the appropriate word to
denote the action of the court before which the trial is had,
declaring the consequences to the convict of the fact thus
ascertained. A pardon granted after verdict of guilty, but
before sentence, and pending a hearing upon exceptions
taken by the accused during the trial, is granted after con-
viction, within the meaning of a constitutional restriction
upon granting pardon before conviction. When, indeed,
the word "conviction" is used to describe the effect of the
guilt of the accused as judicially proved in one case, when
pleaded or given in evidence in another, it is sometimes
used in a more comprehensive sense, including the judg-
ment of the court upon the verdict or confession of guilt;
as, for instance, in speaking of the plea of autrefois con-
vict, or of the effect of guilt, judicially ascertained, as a
disqualification of the convict. Com. v. Lockwood, 109
Mass. 323, 12 Am.Rep. 699; In re Anderson, 34 Cal.App.2d
48, 92 P.2d 1020, 1022. Attorney General ex rel. O'Hara v.
Montgomery, 275 Mich. 504, 267 N.W. 550, 554.
viction of the same offense as that now charged;
pleadable in bar of the prosecution. State v.
Ellsworth, 131 N.C: 773, 42 S.E. 699, 92 Am.St.Rep.
790; Williams v. State, 13 Teg.App. 285, 46 Am.
Rep. 237.
Summary Conviction. The conviction of a per-
son, (usually for a minor misdemeanor,) as the
result of his trial before a magistrate or court,-
without the intervention of a jury, which is au-
thorized by statute in England and in many of
the states. In these proceedings there is no in-
tervention of a jury, but the party accused is ac-
quitted or condemned by the suffrage of such
person only as the statute has appointed to be
his judge. A conviction reached on such a magis-
trate's trial is called a "summary conviction."
Brown; Blair v. Com., 25 Grat. (Va.) 853.

## CONVINCING PROOF

Such as is sufficient to
establish the proposition in question, beyond hesi-
tation, ambiguity, or reasonable doubt, in an un-
prejudiced mind. Evans v. Rugee, 57 Wis. 623,

ZEolian-Skinner Organ Co. v. Shepard Broadcast-
ing Service, C.C.A.Mass., 81 F.2d 392, 395. As to
courts of "co-ordinate jurisdiction," see Jurisdic-
tion.
Co-ordinate and Subordinate are terms often applied as a
test to ascertain the doubtful meaning of clauses in an act
of parliament. If there be two, one of which is gram-
matically governed by the other, it is said to be "subor-
dinate" to it; but, if both are equally governed by some
third clause, the two are called "co-ordinate." Wharton.

## CO-ORDINATE JURISDICTION

That which is
possessed by courts of equal rank, degree, or au-
thority, equally competent to deal with the matter
in question, whether belonging to the same or dif-
ferent systems; concurrent jurisdiction.

## COPAUCENARY

A species of estate, or tenan-
cy, which exists where lands of inheritance de-
scend from the ancestor to two or more persons.
It arises in England either by common law or
particular custom. By common law, as where a
person, seised in fee-simple or fee-tail, dies, and
his next heirs are two or more females, his daugh-
ters, sisters, aunts, cousins, or their representa-
tives; in this case they all inherit, and these co-
heirs, are then called "coparceners," or, for brev-
ity, "parceners" only. Litt. §§ 241, 242; 2 Bl.
Comm. 187. By particular custom, as where lands
descend, as in gavelkind, to all the males in equal
degree, as sons, brothers, uncles, etc. Litt. §
265; 1 Steph. Comm. 319. An estate which several
persons hold as one heir, whether male or female.
This estate has the three unities of time, title,
and possession; but the interests of the coparcen-
ers may be unequal. 1 Washb. Real Prop. 414;
2 Bl. Comm. 188; 4 Kent 366; Flynn v. Herye, 4
Mo.App. 360.
While joint tenancies refer to persons, the idea of copar-
cenary refers to the estate. The title to it is always by
descent. The respective shares may be unequal; as, for
instance, one daughter and two granddaughters, children
of a deceased daughter, may take by the same act of de-
scent. As to strangers, the tenants' seisin is a joint one,
but, as between themselves, each is seised of his or her
own share, on whose death it goes to the heirs, and not
by survivorship. The right of possession of coparceners Ts
in common, and the possession of one is, in general, the
possession of the others. 1 Washb.Real Prop. *414.

## COPARCENERS

inheritance descends jointly, and by whom it is
held as an entire estate. 2 Bl. Comm. 187.

## COPYHOLD

A species of estate at will, or cus-

which are made out by the steward of the manor,
on a tenant's being admitted to any parcel of

an estate at the will of the lord, yet such a will
as is agreeable to the custom of the manor, which
customs are preserved and evidenced by the rolls
of the several courts baron, in which they are
entered. 2 Bl.Comm. 95. In a larger sense, copy-
hold is said to ifnport every customary tenure,
(that is, every tenure pending on the particular
custom of a manor,) as opposed to free socage,
or freehold, which may now (since the abolition
of knight-service) be considered as the general or

## CORNER

A combination among the dealers in
a specific commodity, or outside capitalists, for
the purpose of buying up the greater portion of
that commodity which is upon the market or may
be brought to market, and holding the same back
from sale, until the demand shall so far outrun
the limited supply as to advance the price ab-
normally. Kirkpatrick v. Bonsall, 72 Pa. 158;

A "corner" is a condition arising when a much greater
quantity of any given commodity is sold for future deliv-
ery within a given period than can be purchased in the
market. The buyers, who are called in the slang of the
exchanges, the "longs," then insist on delivery, and thus
succeed in running up the prices to a fictitious point, at
which the deals are "rung out" between the dealers oy the
payment of differences, or, where the buyers insist, by
actual delivery. Kent v. Miltenberger, 13 Mo.App. 503, 506.

tion cannot now be seen, or that no one who saw
the marked corner is produced, does not neces-
sarily make the corner a lost one. Goroski v.
Tawney, 121 Minn. 189, 141 N.W. 102, 103; Coop-
er v. Quade, 191 Iowa, 461, 182 N.W. 798, 799;

toms, and privileges of the kingdom, and to act
and do all things conformably thereto. Wharton.

## CORONATOR

A coroner, (q. v.) Spelman.

## CORONATORE ELIGENDO

The name of a writ
issued to the sheriff, commanding him to proceed
to the election of a coroner.

## CORONATORE EXONERANDO

In English law.
The name of a writ for the removal of a coroner,
for a cause which is to be therein assigned, as
that he is engaged in other business, or incapaci-
tated by years or sickness, or has not a sufficient
estate in the county, or lives in an inconvenient
part of it.

## CORONER

The name of an ancient officer of
the common law, whose office and functions are
continued in modern English and American ad-
ministration. The coroner is an officer belonging
to each county, and is charged with duties both
judicial and ministerial, but chiefly the former.
It is his special province and duty to make inquiry
into the causes and circumstances of any death
happening within his territory which occurs
through violence or suddenly and with marks of
suspicion. This examination (called the "coroner's
inquest") is held with a jury of proper persons
upon view of the dead body. See Bract. fol. 121;
1 Bl.Comm. 346-348; 3 Steph.Comm. 33. In Eng-
land, another branch of his judicial office is to
inquire concerning shipwrecks, and certify wheth-
er wreck or not, and who is in possession of
the goods; and also to inquire concerning treas-
ure trove, who were the finders, and where it is,
and whether any one be suspected of having found
and concealed a treasure. 1 Bl.Comm. 349. It be-
longs to the ministerial office of the coroner to
serve writs and other process, and generally to
discharge the duties of the sheriff, in case of the
incapacity of that officer or a vacancy in his office.
On the office and functions of coroners, see, fur-
ther, Cox v. Royal Tribe, 42 Or. 365, 71 Pac. 73,
60 L.R.A. 620; Lancaster County v. Holyoke, 37
Neb. 328, 55 N.W. 950, 21 L.R.A. 394.

## CORONER'S COURT

In England. A tribunal
of record, where a coroner holds his inquiries.
Cox v. Royal Tribe, 42 Or. 365, 71 P. 73, 60 L.R.A.

## CORONER'S INQUEST

An inquisition or exam-
ination into the causes and circumstances of any
death happening by violence or under suspicious
conditions within his territory, held by the coron-
er with the assistance of a jury. Boisliniere v.
County Com'rs, 32 Mo. 378; Ehlers v. Blood, 175
Misc. 72, 22 N.Y.S.2d 1001, 1005.

## CORPORAL

Griffeth, 162 Ill. 368, 44 N.E. 820.

## CORPORAL OATH

An oath, the external solem-
nity of which consists in laying one's hand upon
the Gospels while the oath is administered to
him. More generally, a solemn oath. Jackson
v. State, 1 Ind. 185; State v. Norris, 9 N.H. 102;
Com. v. Jarboe, 89 Ky. 143, 12 S.W. 138.
The terms "corporal oath" and "solemn oath" are, in
Indiana, at least, used synonymously; and an oath taken
with the uplifted hand may be properly 'described by
either term.

## CORPORAL PUNISHMENT

Physical punish-
ment as distinguished from pecuniary punishment
or a fine; any kind of punishment of or inflicted
on the body, such as whipping or the pillory; the
term may or may not include imprisonment, ac-
cording to the context. Ritchey v. People, 22 Colo.
251, 43 P. 1026; Fowler v. American Mail Line, C.
C.A.Cal., 69 F.2d 905, 907.

threatened riot or to prevent prisoner from doing bodily
harm to an officer or another inmate is not corporal punish-
ment. O'Brien v. Olson, 42 Cal.App.2d 449, 109 P.2d 8, 16.

## CORPORAL TOUCH

tage or in negligent performance of duty speci-
fically imposed by statute. Broome v. City of
Charlotte, 208 N.C. 729, 182 S.E. 325, 326.
CORPORATE ALTER EGO, DOCTRINE OF.
Means that courts ignoring forms and looking
to substance will regard stockholders as owners
of corporation's property, or as the real parties
in interest whenever it is necessary to do so to
prevent fraud which might otherwise be perpe-
trated, to redress a wrong which might otherwise
go without redress, or to do justice which might
otherwise fail. Geary v. Cain, 79 Utah 268, 9 P.
2d 396, 398.

## CORPORATE AUTHORITIES

The title given in
statutes of several states to the aggregate body
of officers of a municipal corporation, or to cer-
tain of those officers (excluding the others) who
are vested with authority in regard to the par-
ticular matter spoken of in the statute, as, taxa-
tion, bonded debt, regulation of the sale of liquors,
etc. See People v. Knopf, 171 Ill. 191, 49 N.E. 424;
State v. Andrews, 11 Neb. 523, 10 N.W. 410; White
v. Papillion Drainage Dist., 96 Neb. 241, 147 N.W.
218, 219; Schaeffer v. Bonham, 95 Ill. 382.

## CORPORATE BODY

This term, or its equiva-
lent "body corporate," is applied to private cor-
porations aggregate; not including municipal cor-
porations. Cedar County v. Johnson, 50 Mo. 225;
East Oakland Tp. v. Skinner, 94 U.S. 256, 24 L.Ed.
125; County Board of Education for Houston
County v. Hunt, 29 Ga.App. 665, 116 S.E. 900.

## CORPORATE BONDS

A written promise by a
corporation under seal to pay a fixed sum of
money at some future time named, with stated
interest payable at some fixed time or intervals,
given in return for money or its equivalent re-
ceived by the corporation, sometimes secured, and
sometimes not. Hammond Lumber Co. v. Adams,
7 Ca1.2d 24, 59 P.2d 1030, 1031.

## CORPORATE FRANCHISE

The right to exist
and do business as a corporation; the right or
privilege granted by the state or government to
the persons forming an aggregate private cor-
poration, and their successors, to exist and do busi-
ness as a corporation and to exercise the rights
and powers incidental to that form of organiza-
California v. San Francisco, 142 Cal. 276, 75 Pac.
832, 64 L.R.A. 918; State on inf. Wear v. Business
Men's Athletic Club, 178 Mo.App. 548, 163 S.W.
901, 907.

## CORPORATE LEGAL INDIVIDUAL

Municipal
corporation possesses two kinds of power, govern-
mental and public, and proprietary and private,
and in exercise of former, corporation is a "muni-
cipal government," while as to latter, it is a "cor-
porate legal individual." Herkimer County v. Vil-
lage of Herkimer, 251 App.Div. 126, 295 N.Y.S. 629,
CORPORATE NAME. When a corporation is
erected, a name is always given to it, or, suppos-
ing none to be actually given, will attach to it by
implication, and by that name alone it must sue
and be sued, and do all legal acts, though a very
minute variation therein is not material, and the
name is capable of being changed (by competent
authority) without affecting the identity or capa-
city of the corporation. Wharton.

## CORPORATE PURPOSE

In reference to muni-
cipal corporations, and especially to their powers
of taxation, a "corporate purpose" is one which
shall promote the general prosperity and the wel-
fare of the municipality. Dickinson v. Salt Lake
City, 57 Utah 530, 195 P. 1110, 1111; City of Quit-
man v. Jelks & McLeod, 139 Ga. 238, 77 S.E. 76;
People ex rel. Moshier v. City of Springfield, 370
Ill. 541, 19 N.E.2d 598, 602; or a purpose necessary
or proper to carry into effect the object of the
creation of the corporate body, People v. School
Trustees, 78 Ill. 140; or one which is germane to
the general scope of the objects for which the
corporation was created or has a legitimate con-
,
nection with those objects and a manifest relation
thereto. Weightman v. Clark, 103 U.S. 256, 26 L.
Ed. 392; Denman v. City of Tacoma, 170 Wash.
406, 16 P.2d 596, 597.

## CORPORATION

An artificial person or legal en-
tity created by or under the authority of the laws
of a state or nation, composed, in some rare in-
stances, of a single person and his successors,
being the incumbents of a particular office, but
ordinarily consisting of an association of numer-
ous individuals, who subsist as a body politic un-
der a special denomination, which is regarded in
law as having a personality and existence distinct
from that of its several members, and which is,
by the same authority, vested with the capacity of
continuous succession, irrespective of changes in
its membership, either in perpetuity or for a limit-
ed term of years, and of acting as a unit or single
individual in matters relating to the common pur-
pose of the association, within the scope of the
powers and authorities conferred upon such bodies
by law. Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 4
Wheat. 518, 636, 657, 4 L.Ed. 629; U. S. v. Trinidad
Coal Co., 137 U.S. 160, 11 S.Ct. 57, 34 L.Ed. 640;
Andrews Bros. Co. v. Youngstown Coke Co., 86 F.
585, 30 C.C.A. 293; Porter v. Railroad Co., 76 Ill.
573; Nebraska Wheat Growers' Ass'n v. Smith,
115 Neb. 177, 212 N.W. 39, 44; State v. Thistle
711; Congdon v. Congdon, 160 Minn. 343, 200 N.W.
76, 87; Forest City Mfg. Co. v. International La-
dies' Garment Workers' Union, Local No. 104, 233
Mo.App. 935, 111 S.W.2d 934; In re Crown Heights
Hospital, 183 Misc. 563, 49 N.Y.S.2d 658, 660; Froe-
lich and Kuttner, of Manila, P. I., V. Sutherland,
57 App.D.C. 294, 22 F.2d 870, 872.
A franchise possessed by one or more individ-
uals, who subsist as a body politic, under a special
denomination, and are vested by the policy of the
law with the capacity of perpetual succession, and
of acting in several respects, however numerous
the association may be, as a single individual. 2
Kent, Comm. 267.
An artificial person or being, endowed by law with the
capacity of perpetual succession; consisting either of a
single individual, (termed a "corporation sole,") or of a
collection of several individuals, (which is termed a "cor-
poration aggregate.") 3 Steph.Comm. 166; 1 Bl.Comm.
467, 469. An intellectual body, created by law, composed
of individuals united under a common name, the members
of which succeed each other, so that the body continues
always the same, notwithstanding the change of the indi-
viduals who compose it, and which, for certain purposes,
is considered a natural person. Civil Code La. art. 427.
A "corporation" is more nearly a method than a thing,
and the law, in dealing with a corporation, need not define
it as a person or entity, or even as an embodiment of func-
tions, rights, and duties. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. v.
Pierson, 222 N.Y.S. 532, 543, 130 Misc. 110.
The statement that a "corporation" is an artificial per-
son or entity, apart from its members, is merely a descrip-
tion, in figurative language, of a corporation viewed as a
collective body. McIntosh v. Dakota Trust Co., 52 N.D.
752, 204 N.W. 818, 825, 40 A.L.R. 1021.
A corporation is a collection of natural persons, joined
together by their voluntary action or by legal compulsion,
by or under the authority of an act of the Legislature,
consisting either of a special charter or of a general per-
missive statute, to accomplish some purpose, pecuniary,
ideal, or governmental, authorized by the charter or gov-
erning statute. State v. Knights of Ku Klux Klan, 117
Kan. 564, 232 P. 254, 257, 37 A.L.R. 1267.
Classification
According to the accepted definitions and rules,
corporations are classified as follows:
Public and private. A public corporation is one
created by the state for political purposes and to
act as an agency in the administration of civil
government, generally within a particular terri-
tory or subdivision of the state, and usually in-
vested, for that purpose, with subordinate and lo-
cal powers of legislation; such as a county, city,
town, or school district. These are also some-
times called "political corporations." Goodwin v.
East Hartford, 70 Conn. 18, 38 A. 876; Dean v.
Davis, 51 Cal. 409; Ten Eyck v. Canal Co., 18 N.J.
Law, 200, 37 Am.Dec. 233; Murphy v. Mercer
County, 57 N.J.Law, 245, 31 A. 229; Van Campen
v. Olean General Hospital, 210 App.Div. 204, 205
N.Y.S. 554, 555; Providence Engineering Corpora-
tion v. Downey Snipbuilding Corporation, C.C.A.
N.Y., 294 F. 641, 646; National Bank of Commerce
in New Orleans v. Board of Sup'rs of La. State
University and Agricultural and Mechanical Cor-
lege, 206 La. 913, 20 So.2d 264, 269.
Private corporations are those founded by and
composed of private individuals, for private pur
poses, and having no political or governmental
franchises or duties. Santa Clara County v.
Southern Pac. R. Co., C.C.Cal., 18 F. 385, 402;
People v. McAdams, 82 Ill. 361; Providence En-
gineering Corporation v. Downey Shipbuilding
Corporation, C.C.A.N.Y., 294 F. 641, 648.
The true distinction between public and private cor-
porations is that the former are organized for govern-
mental purposes, the latter not. The term "public" has
sometimes been applied to corporations of which the gov-
ernment owned the entire stock, as in the case of a state
bank. But bearing in mind that "public" is here equiva-
lent to "political," IA will be apparent that this is a mis-
nomer. Again the fact that the business or operations of
a corporation may directly and very extensively affect the
general public (as in the case of a railroad company or a
bank or an insurance company) is no reason for calling it
a public corporation. If organized by private persons for
their own advantage,—or even if organized for the benefit
of the public generally, as in the case of a free public
hospital or other charitable institution,--it is none the
less a private corporation, if it does not possess govern-
mental powers or functions. The uses may in a sense be
called "public," but the corporation is "private," as much
so as if the franchises were vested in a single person.
Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 4 Wheat. 562, 4 L.Ed.
629; Ten Eyok v. Canal Co., 18 N.J.Law, 204, 37 Am.Dec.
233. It is to be observed, however, that those corporations
which serve the public or contribute to the comfort and
convenience of the general public, though owned and man-
aged by private interests, are now (and quite appropri-
ately) denominated "public-service corporations." See
infra. Another distinction between public and private cor-
porations is that the former are not voluntary associations
(as the latter are) and that there is no contractual rela-
tion between the government and a public corporation or
between the individuals who compose it. Mor.Priv.Corp. §
3; Goodwin v. East Hartford, 70 Conn. 18, 38 A. 876.
The terms "public" and "municipal," as applied to cor-
porations, are not convertible. All municipal corporations
are public, but not vice versa. Brown v. Board of Educa-
tion, 108 Ky. 783, 57 S.W. 612. But there may also be
"public" corporations which are not "municipal" even in
this wider sense of the latter term. Such, according to
some of the authorities, are the "irrigation districts" now
known in several of the western states. Irrigation Dist. v.
Collins, 46 Neb. 411, 64 N.W. 1086. Compare Herring v.
Modesta Irrigation Dist., C.C.Cal., 95 F. 705.
Ecclesiastical and lay. In the English law, all
corporations private are divided into ecclesiasti-
cal and lay, the former being such corporations
as are composed exclusively of ecclesiastics or-
ganized for spiritual purposes, or for administer-
ing property held for religious uses, such as bish-
ops and certain other dignitaries of the church
and (formerly) abbeys and monasteries. 1 Bl.
Comm. 470. Lay corporations are those composed
of laymen, and existing for secular or business
purposes. This distinction is not recognized in.
American law. Corporations formed for the pur-
pose of maintaining or propagating religion or of
supporting public religious services, according to
the rites of particular denominations, and inci-
dentally owning and administering real and per-
sonal property for religious uses, are called "re-
ligious corporations," as distinguished from busi-
ness corporations; but they are "lay" corpora-
tions, and not "ecclesiastical" in the sense of the
English law. Robertson v. Bullions, 11 N.Y. 243.
Eleemosynary and civil. Lay corporations are
classified as "eleemosynary" and "civil;" the for-
mer being such as are created for the distribution
of alms or for the administration of charities or
"charitable" in its widest sense, including hospi-
tals, asylums, and colleges; the latter being or-
ganized for the facilitating of business transac-
tions and the profit or advantage of the members.
1 Bl.Comm. 471; Dartmouth College v. Woodward,
4 Wheat. 660, 4 L.Ed. 629.
In the law of Louisiana, the term "civil" as applied to
corporations, is used in a different sense, being contrasted
with "religious." Civil corporations are those which relate
to temporal police; such are the corporations of the cities,
the companies for the advancement of commerce and agri-
culture, literary societies, colleges or universities founded
for the instruction of youth, and the like. Religious cor-
porations are those whose establishment relates only to
religion; such are the congregations of the different reli-
gious persuasions. Civ.Code La. art. 431.
Aggregate and sole. A corporation sole is one
consisting of one person only, and his successors
in some ,particular station, who are incorporated
bylaw in order to. give them some legal capaci-
ties and advantages, particularly that of perpe-
tuity, which. in their natural persons they could
not have had. In this sense, the sovereign in Eng-
land is a sole corporation, so is a bishop, so are
some deans distinct from their several chapters,
and so is every parson and vicar. 3 Steph.Comm.
168, 169; First Parish v. Dunning, 7 Mass. 447;
Reid v. Barry, 93 Fla. 849, 112 So. 846, 859.
A corporation aggregate is one composed of a
number of individuals vested with corporate pow-
ers; and a "corporation," as the word is used in
general popular and legal speech, and as defined
at the head of this title, means a "corporation
aggregate."
Domestic and foreign. With reference to the
laws and the courts of any given state, a "domes-
tic" corporation is one created by, or organized un-
der, the laws of that state; a "foreign" corpora-
tion is one created by or under the laws of anoth-
er state, government, or country. In re Grand
Lodge, 110 Pa. 613, 1 A. 582; Fowler v. Chilling-
worth, 94 Fla. 1, 113 So. 667, 669; In re Ewles'
Estate, 105 Utah 507, 143 P.2d 903, 905.
Close and open. A "close" corporation is one in
which the directors and officers have the power to
fill vacancies in their own number, without allow-
ing to the general body of stockholders any choice
or vote in their election. An "open" corporation is
one in which all the members or corporators have
a vote in the election of the directors and other
officers. McKim v. Odom, 3 Bland, Md., 416.
A close corporation is one which fills its own vacancies or
in which power of voting is held through manipulation
under fixed and virtually perpetual proxies. Brooks v.
Willcuts, C.C.A.Minn., 78 F.2d 270, 273.
Subsidiary and parent. Subsidiary corporation
is one in which another corporation (called par-
ent 'corporation) owns at least a majority of the
shares, and thus has control. Wheeler v. New
York, N. H. and H. R. Co., 112 Conn. 510, 153 A.
159, 160; International Order of Twelve Knights
and Daughters of Tabor v. Fridia, Tex.Civ.App.,
91 S.W.2d 404.
A business corporation. One formed for the
purpose of transacting business in the widest
sense of that term, including not only trade and
commerce, but manufacturing, mining, banking,
insurance, transportation, and practically every
form of commercial or industrial activity where
the purpose of the organization is pecuniary prof-
it; contrasted with religious, charitable, educa-
tional, and other like organizations, which are
sometimes grouped in the statutory law of a state
under the general designation of "corporations not
for profit." Winter v. Railroad Co., 30 Fed.Cas.
329; McLeod v. College, 69 Neb. 550, 96 N.W. 265.
Corporation de facto. One existing under color
of law and in pursuance of an effort made in good
faith to organize a corporation under the statute;
an association of men claiming to be a legally in-
corporated company, and exercising the powers
and functions of a corporation, but without actual
lawful authority to do so. Foster v. Hare, 26 Tex.
Civ.App. 177, 62 S.W. 541; Cedar Rapids Water
Co. v. Cedar Rapids, 118 Iowa, 234, 91 N.W. 1081;
Tulare Irrig. Dist. v. Shepard, 185 U.S. 1, 22 S.Ct.
531, 46 L.Ed. 773; Evens v. Anderson, 132 Minn.
59, 155 N.W. 1040, 1041.
Its elements are a law or charter authorizing such a
corporation, an attempt in good faith to comply with law
authorizing its incorporation, and unintentional omission
of essential requirements of the law or charter, and exer-
cise in good faith of corporate functions under the law or
charter. Richmond v. Town of Largo, 155 Fla. 226, 19
So.2d 791, 793.
Corporation de jure. That which exists by rea-
son of full compliance by incorporators with re-
quirements of an existing law permitting organiza-
tion of such corporation; it is impregnable to as-
sault in the courts from any source. Henderson
v. School Dist. No. 44, 75 Mont. 154, 242 P. 979, 980.
Joint-stock corporation. This differs from a
joint-stock company in being regularly incorporat-
ed, instead of being a mere partnership, but re-
sembles it in having a capital divided into shares
of stock. Most business corporations (as distin-
guished from eleemosynary corporations) are of
this character.
A "joint-stock corporation" is one organized under a
general statute authorizing the creation of such corpora-
tions and providing the procedure for creating it, and is
distinguished from a "corporation" created by special
resolution or act of the Legislature, which resolution or
act is the charter of the corporation, when accepted, and
the corporation organized thereunder, and the corporation
is a chartered corporation, as distinguished from a joint-
stock corporation. Barber v. Morgan, 89 Conn. 583, 94 A.
984, 986, Ann.Cas.1916E, 102.
Migratory corporation. A corporation, organ-
ized under laws of another state than that of in-
corporators' residence for purpose of doing all or
greater part of their business in state of their
residence or in other state than that of incorpora-
tion. Toklan Royalty Corporation v. Tiffany, 193
Oki. 120, 141 P.2d 571, 573.
Moneyed corporations are, properly speaking,
those dealing in money or in the business of re-
ceiving deposits, loaning money, and exchange;
ness corporations having a money capital and em-
ploying it in the conduct of their business. Mu-
tual Ins. Co. v. Erie County, 4 N.Y. 444; In re
California Pac. R. Co., 4 Fed.Cas. 1,060; Hobbs v.
National Bank, C.C.A.N.Y., 101 F. 75, 41 C.C.A.
Municipal corporations. See that title.
Public-service corporations. Those whose op-
erations serve the needs of the general public or
conduce to the comfort and convenience of an en-
tire community, such as railroads, gas, water, and
electric light companies. The business of such
companies is said to be "affected with a public
interest," and for that reason they are subject to
legislative regulation and control to a greater ex-
tent than corporations not of this character.
Washington & C. Ry. Co. v. Mobile & 0. R. Co.,
C.C.A.Ala., 255 F. 12, 14.
Quasi corporations. Organizations resembling
corporations; municipal societies or similar
bodies which, though not true corporations in all
respects, are yet recognized, by statutes or im-
memorial usage, as persons or aggregate corpora-
tions, with precise duties which may be enforced,
and privileges which may be maintained, by suits
at law. They may be considered quasi corpo-
rations, with limited powers, co-extensive with
the duties imposed upon them by statute or
usage, but restrained from a general use of the
authority which belongs to those metaphysical
persons by the common law. Scates v. King, 110
Ill. 456; Barnes v. District of Columbia, 91 U.S.
552, 23 L.Ed. 440.
This term is lacking in definiteness and precision. It
appears to be applied indiscriminately (a) to all kinds of
municipal corporations, the word "quasi" being introduced
because it is said that these are not voluntary organiza-
tions like private corporations, but created by the legisla-
ture for its own purposes and without reference to the
wishes of the people of the territory affected; (b) to all
municipal corporations except cities and incorporated
towns, the latter being considered the only true municipal
corporations because they exist and act under charters or
statutes of incorporation while counties, school districts,
and the like are merely created or set off under general
laws; (c) to municipal corporations possessing only a low
order of corporate existence or the most limited range of
corporate powers, such as hundreds in England, and coun-
ties, villages, and school districts in America.
A term applied to those bodies, or municipal societies,
which, though not vested with the general powers of cor-
porations, are yet recognized, by statutes or immemorial
usage, as persons, or aggregate corporations, with precise
duties, which may be enforced, and privileges, which may
be maintained, by suits at law. State v. Hagen, 136 La.
868, 67 So. 935, 936.
There is a well-defined and marked distinction between
municipal corporations proper and political or quasi cor-
porations. Cities, towns, and villages are municipal cor-
porations proper, while counties, townships, school dis-
tricts, road districts, and the like are quasi corporations.
City of East Cleveland v. Board of Education of City
School Dist. of East Cleveland, 112 Ohio St. 607, 148 N.E.
350, 351.
"Quasi corporation" is a phrase used to designate bodies
which possess a limited number of corporate powers, and
which are low down in the scale or grade of corporate
existence, and is generally applied to a body which exer-
cises certain functions of a corporate character, but which
has not been created a corporation by any statute, general
or special. Eakle v. Board of Education of Independent
School Dist. of Henry, 97 W.Va. 434, 125 S.E. 165, 167.
Quasi public corporation. This term Is some-
times applied to corporations which are not strict-
ly public, in the sense of being organized for gov-
ernniental purposes, but whose operations con-
tribute to the comfort, convenience, or welfare of
the general public, such as telegraph and tele-
phone companies, gas, water, and electric light
companies, and irrigation companies. More com-
monly and more correctly styled "public-service
corporations." Wiemer v. Louisville Water Co.,
C.C.Ky., 130 F. 251; Campbell v. Watson, 62 N.J.
Eq. 396, 50 A. 120; Burgess v. City of Brockton,
235 Mass. 95, 126 N.E. 456, 460; Van Valkenburgh
v. Ford, Tex.Civ.App., 207 S.W. 405, 414; Borough
of Mt. Union v. Kunz, 290 Pa. 356, 139 A. 118, 121.
There is a large class of private corporations which on
account of special franchises conferred on them owe a duty
to the public which they may be compelled to perform.
This class of corporations is known as public service cor-
porations, and in legal phraseology as "quasi public cor-
porations," or corporations affected with a public interest.
A "quasi public corporation" may be said to be a private
corporation which has given to it certain powers of a pub-
lic nature, such, for instance, as the power of eminent
domain, in order to enable it to discharge its duties for
the public benefit, in which respect it differs from an
ordinary private corporation, the powers of which are given
and exercised for the exclusive advantage of its stockhold-
ers. State ex rel.. Coco v. Riverside Irr. Co., 142 La. 10, 76
So. 216, 218.
The term is also applied to corporations of that class
sometimes called "quasi municipal corporations," such as
school districts; Courtright v. Consolidated Independent
School Dist. of Mapleton, 203 Iowa, 26, 212 N.W. 368. 369;
road districts; Road Improvement Dist. No. 7 of Poinsett
County, Ark., v. Guardian Savings & Trust Co., C.C.A.
Ark., 298 F. 272, 274; Taylor Coal Co. v. Board of Drain-
age Com'rs of Ohio County, 189 Ky. 793, 225 S. W. 368, 369;
irrigation districts; Bonneville Irr. Dist. v. Ririe, 57 Utah,
306, 195 P. 204, 205; and counties, townships, etc. Forbes
Pioneer Boat Line v. Board of Com'rs of Everglades Drain-
age Dist., 77 Fla. 742, 82 So. 346, 350.
Spiritual corporations. Corporations, the mem-
bers of which are entirely spiritual persons, and
incorporated as such, for the furtherance of reli-
gion and perpetuating the rights of the church.
Trading corporations. A commercial corpora-
tion engaged in buying and selling. The word
"trading," is much narrower in scope than "busi-
ness," as applied to corporations, and though a
trading corporation is a business corporation,
there are many business corporations which are
not trading companies. Dartmouth College v.
Woodward, 4 Wheat. 669, 4 L.Ed. 629; Adams v.
Railroad Co., 1 Fed.Cas. 92.
Tramp corporations. Companies chartered in
one state without any intention of doing business
therein, but which carry on their business and op-
erations wholly in other states. State v. Georgia
Co., 112 N.C. 34, 17 S.E. 10, 19 L.R.A. 485.
Synonyms
The words "company" and "corporation" are
commonly used as interchangeable terms. In
strictness, however, a company is an association
of persons for business or other purposes, em-
bracing a considerable number of individuals,
which may or may not be incorporated. In the
former case, it is legally a partnership or a joint-
stock company; in the latter case, it is properly
called a "corporation." Goddard v. Railroad Co.,
202 Ill. 362, 66 N.E. 1066. For the particulars in
which corporations differ from "Joint-Stock Com-
panies" and "Partnerships," see those titles.

## CORPORATION ACT

In English law. The stat-
ute 13 Car. II. St. 2, c. 1; by which it was pro-
vided that no person should thereafter be elected
to office in any corporate town that should not,
within one year previously, have taken the sacra-
ment of the Lord's Supper, according to the rites
of the Church of England; and every person so
elected was also required to take the oaths of al-
legiance and supremacy. 3 Steph.Comm. 103, 104;
4 Bl.Comm. 58. This statute is now repealed. 4
Steph.Comm. 511.

## CORPORATION COURTS

Certain courts in Vir-
ginia described as follows: "For each city of the
state, there shall be a court called a 'corporation
court,' to be held by a judge, with like qualifica-
tions and elected in the same manner as judges of
the county court." Code Va.1887, § 3050, Code
1919, § 5905.

## CORPORATOR

A member of a corporation ag-
gregate. Grant, Corp. 48; Seaborn v. Wingfield,
56 Nev. 260, 48 P.2d 881, 883.

## CORPORE ET ANIMO

Lat. By the body and
by the mind; by the physical act and by the men-
tal intent. Dig. 41, 2, 3.

## CORPOREAL

A term descriptive of such things
as have an objective, material existence; percepti-
ble by the senses of sight and touch; possessing a
real body. Opposed to incorporeal and spiritual.
Sullivan v. Richardson, 33 Fla. 1, 14 So. 692; Bour-
land v. State, 133 Tex.Cr.R. 544, 112 S.W.2d 720,
There is a distinction between "corporeal" and "corpo-
ral." The former term means "possessing a body," that
is, tangible, physical, material; the latter means "relating
to or affecting a body," that is, bodily, external. Corpo-
real denotes the nature or physical existence of a body;
corporal denotes its exterior or the co-ordination of it with
some other body. Hence we speak of "corporeal heredita-
ments," but of "corporal punishment," "corporal touch,"
"corporal oath," etc.

## CORPOREAL HEREDITAMENTS

See Heredita-
ments.

## CORPOREAL PROPERTY

Such as affects the
senses, and may be seen and handled, as opposed
to incorporeal property, which cannot be seen or
handled, and exists only in contemplation. Moz-
ley & Whitley.
Thus a house is corporeal, but the annual rent payable
for its occupation is incorporeal. Corporeal property is, if
movable, capable of manual transfer ; if immovable, pos-
session of it may be delivered up. But incorporeal prop-
erty cannot be so transferred, but some other means must
be adopted for its transfer, of which the most usual is an
instrument in writing.
In Roman law, the distinction between things corporeal
and incorporeal rested on the sense of touch; tangible
objects only were considered corporeal. In modern law,
all things which may be perceived by any of the bodily
senses are termed corporeal, although a common definition
• of the word includes merely that which can be touched
and seen. 14a C.J. 1424 (citing Abbott's Diet.). Marnett
Oil & Gas Co. v. Munsey, Tex.Civ.App., 232 S.W. 867, 869;
Sullivan v. Richardson, 33 Fla. 1, 116, 14 So. 692.
term "property," however, is a generic term of
extensive application. 32 Cyc. 647. In its strict legal
sense, "property" is nothing but the right of dominion,
possession, and disposition which may be acquired over
physical things. Braceville Coal ,Co. v. People, 147 Ill. 66,
35 N.E. 62, 22 L.R.A. 340; Fears v. State, 102 Ga. 274, 29
S.E. 463; De Lauder v. Baltimore County, 94 Md. 1, 50 A.
427. It follows that from that point of view, there is no
such thing as "tangible" property or "corporeal" property,
and the only meaning which can in law he given to the
expression "corporeal property" is the right to possess,
use, occupy, and enjoy corporeal things and take the profits
thereof. Transcontinental Oil Co. v. Emmerson, 298 Ill.
394, 131 N.E. 645, 648, 16 A.L.R. 507.

## CORRECT ATTEST

These words, used before
the signatures of bank directors to reports made
to the commissioner of banking, mean not alone
to bear witness, but to affirm to be true or genu-
ine, and such words are appropriately used for the
affirmation of persons in their official capacity to

Massachusetts Bonding & Ins. Co., .165 Wis. 493,
162 N.W. 662, 663.

## CORRECTED POLICY

tigation of risk to correct misstatements in policy

Bradley v. State, 19 Ala.App. 578, 99 So. 321, 322;

R. 101, 97 S.W.2d 175, 177.
The expression "corroborating circumstances" clearly
does not mean facts which, independent of a confession,
will warrant a conviction; for then the verdict would
stand not on the confession, but upon those independent
circumstances. To corroborate is to strengthen, to confirm-
by additional security, to add strength. The testimony of
a witness is said to be corroborated when it is shown to
correspond with the representation of some other witness,
or to comport with some facts otherwise known or estab-
lished. Corroborating circumstances, then, used in refer-
ence to a confession, are such as serve to strengthen it, to
render it more probable; such, in short, as may serve to
impress a jury with a belief in its truth. State v. Guild,
10 N.J.Law, 163, 18 Am. Dec. 404.

## CORROBORATING EVIDENCE

plementary to that already given and tending to

ing Evidence.

praved; debased. Webster.

## CORRUPT INTENT

A "corrupt intent," as an
element of usury, consists in the charging or re-
ceiving of excessive interest with knowledge that
it is prohibited by law and the purpose to violate
the law. Ector v. Osborne, 179 N.C. 667, 103 S.E.
388, 389, 13 A.L.R. 1207; Teshner v. Roome, 106
Or. 382, 212 P. 473, 474. But see Dege v. Produce
2d 423, 425, which only requires intent to receive
more than the law permits for forbearance of
money, but does not require that taker knows that
he is violating usury law.

## CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT

25, 1910, c. 392, 36 Stat. 822, which, like the Eng-
lish act of 1883 and supplements, dealt with "cor-

goods. Buck v. Burk, 18 N.Y. 337; Esterman•Ver-
kamp Co. v. Rouse, 211 Ky. 791, 278 S.W. 124, 127.

in endeavoring to make collection, as of a promis-
sory note; but as used in or with reference to such
notes, the phrase is synonymous with attorney's
fees. McClain v. Continental Supply Co., 66 Okl.
225, 168 P. 815, 818; Wood v. Ferguson, 71 Mont.
540, 230 P. 592, 594. It does not refer to costs of
suit, which are recoverable by law. Cox v. Hagan,
125 Va. 656, 100 S.E. 666, 674.

## CO-STIPULATOR

A joint promisor.

## COSTS

A pecuniary allowance, made to the suc-
cessful party, (and recoverable from the losing
party,) for his expenses in prosecuting or defend-
ing a suit or a distinct proceeding within a suit.
Stevens v. Bank, 168 N.Y. 560, 61 N.E. 904; Ben-
nett v. Kroth, 37 Kan. 235, 15 P. 221, 1 Am.St.Rep.
248; Pezel v. Yerex, 56 Cal.App. 304, 205 P. 475,
478; In re Leary's Estate, 172 Misc. 286, 14 N.Y.S.
2d 960, 961.
Expenses pending suit as allowed or taxed by the court.
Jones v. Adkins, 170 Ark. 288, 280 S.W. 389, 394.
Fees and charges required by law to be paid
to the courts or some of their officers, the amount
of which is fixed by law. Blair v. Brownstone
Oil & Refining Co., 20 Cal.App. 316, 128 P. 1022.
Costs and fees were originally altogether different in
their nature. The one is an allowance to a party for
expenses incurred in prosecuting or defending a suit; the
other, a compensation to an officer for services rendered in
the progress of a cause. Therefore, while an executor or
administrator was not personally liable to his adversary
for costs, yet, if at his instance an officer performed serv-
ices for him, he had a personal demand for his fees. Mus-
ser v. Good, 11 Serg. & R., Pa., 247. Moreover, costs are
an incident to the judgment; fees are compensation to
public officers for services rendered individuals not in the
course of litigation. Tillman v. Wood, 58 Ala. 579.
In Georgia, however, it is held that "costs," include all
charges fixed by statute as compensation for services ren-
dered by officers of the court in the progress of the cause.
Welton. County v. Dean, 23 Ga.App. 97, 97 S.E. 561, 562.
There is no general or controlling provision or principle
of law to the effect that attorney fees that may by statute
be recovered by the winning party against the losing party
in a suit or action are, or should be regarded as, costs in
the case. "Costs" do not include attorney fees unless such
fees are by a statute denominated costs or are by statute
allowed to be recovered as costs in the case. State ex rel.
Royal Ins. Co. v. Barrs, 87 Fla. 168, 99 So. 668, 669;
McRostie v. City of Owatonna, 152 Minn. 63, 188 N.W. 52,
54; Littlefield v. Scott, Tex.Civ.App., 244 S.W. 824, 826;
Calman v. Cox, Mo.App., 296 S.W. 845, 846; City of Los
Angeles v. Abbott, 217 Cal. 184, 17 P.2d 993, 996.
But the word "costs" is frequently understood as includ-
ing attorney fees. McClain v. Continental Supply Co., 66
Okl. 225, 168 P. 815, 817; Livesley v. Strauss, 104 Or. 356,
207 P. 1095; Lonoke County v. Reed, 122 Ark. 111, 182
S.W. 563, 564; J. I. Case Plow-Works v. J. I. Case Thresh-
ing Mach. Co., 162 Wis. 185, 155 N.W. 128, 138.
In England, the term "costs" is also used to
designate the charges which an attorney or solidi-,
tor is entitled to make and recover from his client,
as his remuneration for professional services,,
such as legal advice, attendances, drafting and
copying documents, conducting legal proceedings,
etc.
Bill of Costs. A certified, itemized statement of
the amount of costs in an action or suit.
Certificate for Costs. In English practice, a cer-
tificate or memorandum drawn up and signed by
the judge before whom a case was tried, setting
out certain facts, the existence of which must be
thus proved before the party is entitled, under the
statutes, to recover costs.
Cost Bond, or Bond for Costs. A bond given by
a party to an action to secure the eventual pay-
ment of such costs as may be awarded against
him.
Costs de Incremento. Increased costs, costs of
increase. Costs adjudged by the court in addi-
tion to those assessed by the jury. Day v. Wood-
worth, 13 How. 372, 14 L.Ed. 181.
Those extra expenses incurred which do not appear on
the face of the proceedings, such as witnesses' expenses,
fees to counsel, attendances, court fees, etc. Wharton.
Costs cf the Day. Costs which are incurred in
preparing for the trial of a cause on a specified
day, consisting of witnesses' fees, and other fees
of attendance. Archb.N.Prac. 281; Ad.Eq. 343.
Costs to Abide Event. When an order is made
by an appellate court reversing a judgment, with
the order include those of the appeal, so that, if
the appellee is finally successful, he is entitled to
tax the costs of the appeal. First Nat. Bank v.
Fourth Nat. Bank, 84 N.Y. 469; Casualty Co. of
America v. A. L. Swett Electric Light & Power
Co., 121 Misc. 268, 200 N.Y.S. 79,6, 801.
Double Costs. The ordinary single costs of suit,
and one-half of that amount in addition. 2 Tidd,
Pr. 987. "Double" is not used here in its ordinary
sense of "twice" the amount. Van Aulen v. Deck-
er, 2 N.J.Law, 108; Gilbert v. Kennedy, 22 Mich.
19. But see Moran v. Hudson, 34 N.J.Law, 531.
These costs are now abolished in England by St.
5 & 6 Vict. c. 97. Wharton,
Final Costs. Such costs as are to be paid at the
end of the suit; costs, the liability for which de-
pends upon the final result of the litigation. Good-
year v. Sawyer, C.C.Tenn., 17 F. 8.
Interlocutory Costs. In practice. Costs accru-
ing upon proceedings in the intermediate stages
of a cause, as distinguished from final costs; such
as the costs of motions. 3 Chit.Gen.Pr. 597; Good-
year v. Sawyer, C.C.Tenn., 17 F. 6.
Security for Costs. In practice. A security
which a defendant in an action may require of a
plaintiff who does not reside within the jurisdic-
tion of the court, for the payment of such costs as
may be awarded to the defendant. 1 Tidd, Pr. 534.
Ex parte Louisville & N. R. Co., 124 Ala. 547, 27
So. 239.
Treble Costs. A rate of costs given in certain
actions, consisting, according to its technical im-
port, of the common costs, half of these, and half
of the latter. 2 Tidd, Pr. 988. The word "treble,"
in this application, is not understood in its literal
sense of thrice the amount of single costs, but
signifies merely the addition together of the three
sums fixed as above. Id. Treble costs have been
abolished in England, by St. 5 & 6 Vict. c. 97. In
American law. In Pennsylvania and New Jersey
the rule is different. When an act of assembly
gives treble costs, the party is allowed three times
the usual costs, with the exception that the fees
of the officers are not to be trebled when they are
not regularly or usually payable by the defendant.

Anthony, 16 Pa. 256; Mairs v. Sparks, 5 N.J.Law,

same act which abolished the Star Chamber.
Brown.

## COUNSEL

1. In practice. An advocate, coun-
sellor, or pleader. 3 Bl.Comm. 26; 1 Kent, Comm.
307. One who assists his client with advice, and
pleads for him in open court. One who has been
admitted as an attorney and counsellor at law.
Baker v. State, 9 Okl.Cr. 62, 130 P. 820, 821. See
Counsellor.
Counsellors who are associated with those reg-
ularly retained in a cause, either for the purpose of
advising as to the points of law involved, or pre-
paring the case on its legal side, or arguing ques-
tions of law to the court, or preparing or conduct-
ing the case on its appearance before an appellate
tribunal, are said to be "of counsel."
2. Knowledge. A grand jury is sworn to keep
secret "the commonwealth's counsel, their fel-
lows', and their own."
3. Advice given by one person to another in
regard to a proposed line of conduct, claim, or con-
tention. State v. Russell, 83 Wis. 330, 53 N.W. 441.
quently are, used in criminal law to describe the offense of
a person who, not actually doing the felonious act, by his
will contributed to it or procured it to be done. Omer v.
Corn., 95 Ky. 353, 25 S.W. 594.
Counsel's signature. This is required, in some
jurisdictions, to be affixed to pleadings, etc., as
affording the court a means of judging whether
they are interposed in good faith and upon legal
grounds. It has been held that the word "counsel"
in this connection denotes a person capable of
testifying, and that a certificate bearing only the
firm signatures of partnerships of attorneys is in-
sufficient. Benedict v. Seiberling, D.C., 17 F.2d
831, 838.
Junior counsel. The younger of the counsel em-
ployed on the same side of a case, or the one lower
in standing or rank, or who is intrusted with the

## COUNSELLOR

An advocate or barrister. A
member of the legal profession whose special func-
tion is to give counsel or advice as to the legal
aspects of judicial controversies, or their prepara-
tion and management, and to appear in court for
the conduct of trials, or the argument of causes,
or presentation of motions, or any other legal
business that takes him into the presence of the
court.
In some of the states, the two words "counsellor" and
"attorney" are used interchangeably to designate all
lawyers. In others, the latter term alone is used, "coun-
sellor" not being recognised as a technical name. In still
others, the two are associated together as the full legal
title of any person who has been admitted to practice in
the courts; while in a few they denote different grades,
it being prescribed that no one can become a counsellor
until he has been an attorney for a specified time and has
passed a second examination.
In the practice of the United States supreme court, the
term denotes an officer who is employed by a party in a
cause to conduct the same on its trial on his behalf. He
differs from an attorney at law.
In the supreme court of the United States, the two
degrees of attorney and counsel were at first kept separate,
and no person was permitted to practice in both capacities,
but the present practice is otherwise. Weeks, Attys. at
Law, 54. It is the duty of the counsel to draft or review
and correct the special pleadings, to manage the cause on
trial, and, during the whole course of the suit, to apply
established principles of law to the exigencies of the ease.
1 Kent, Comm. 307.

in court.
Count upon a statute. To make express refer-

statute" (or "by the force of the statute") "in
such case made and provided." Richardson v.
Fletcher, 74 Vt. 417, 52 A. 1064.
"Pleading the statute" is stating the facts which bring
the case within it, and "counting" on it is making express
reference to it by apt terms to show the source of right
relied on. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. State, 73 Fla. 609,
74 So. 595, 599.
ment of his cause of action. The different parts of
a declaration, each of which, if it stood alone,
would constitute a ground for action. Used also
to signify the several parts of an indictment,
each charging a distinct offense. Boren v. State,
23 Tex.App. 28, 4 S.W. 463; Bailey v. Mosher, C.
C.A.Neb., 63 F. 490, 11 C.C.A. 304; Ryan v. Riddle,
109 Mo.App. 115, 82 S.W. 1117.
"Count" and "charge" when used relative to allegations
in an indictment or information are synonymous. State v.
Thornton, 142 La. 797, 77 So. 634, 636; State v. Puckett,
39 N.M. 511, 50 P.2d 964, 965.

declaration. Odger, C. LI 1029.
Common counts. Certain general counts or
forms inserted in a declaration in an action to
recover a money debt, not founded on the circum-
stances of the individual case, but intended to
guard against a possible variance, and to enable
the plaintiff to take advantage of any ground of
liability which the proof may disclose, within the
general scope of the action. Nugent v. Teauchot,
67 Mich. 571, 35 N.W. 254.
In the action of assumpsit, these counts are as follows :
For goods sold and delivered, or bargained and sold; for
work done; for money lent; for money paid; for money
received to the use of the plaintiff ; for interest; or for
money due on an account stated.
General count. One stating in a general way
the plaintiff's claim. Wertheim v. Casualty Co., 72
Vt. 326, 47 A. 1071.
Money counts. A species of common counts, so
called from the subject-matter of them; embrac-
ing the indebitatus assumpsit count for money
lent and advanced, for money paid and expended,
and for money had and received, together with the
insimul computassent count, or count for money
due on an account stated. 1 Burrill, Pr. 132.
Omnibus count. A count which combines in
one all the money counts with one for goods sold
and delivered, work and labor, and an account
stated. Webber v. Tivill, 2 Saund. 122; Griffin v.
Murdock, 88 Me. 254, 34 A. 30.
Several counts. Where a plaintiff has several
distinct causes of action, he is allowed to pursue
them cumulatively in the same action, subject to
certain rules which the law prescribes. Wharton.
Special count. As opposed to the common
counts, in pleading, 'a special count is a statement
of the actual facts of the particular case, or a
count in which the plaintiff's claim is set forth
with all needed particularity. Wertheim v. Cas-
ualty Co., 72 Vt. 326, 47 A. 1071.

## COUNT

(Fr. comte; from the Latin comes.)
An earl.
It gave way as a distinct title to the Saxon earl, but was
retained in countess, viscount, and as the basis of county.
Termes de la ley; 1 Bla.Comm. 398.
Forty members form a house of commons; and,
though there be ever so many at the beginning of
a debate, yet, if during the course of it the house
should be deserted by the members, till reduced
below the number of forty, any one member may
have it adjourned upon its being counted; but a
debate may be continued when only one member
is left in the house, provided no one choose to
move an adjournment. Wharton.
The words "count and count-out" refer to the count of
the house of commons by the speaker. Forty members,
including the speaker, are required to constitute a quorum.
Each day after parliament is opened, the speaker counts
the house. If forty members are not present he waits till
four o'clock, and then counts the house again. If forty
members are not then present, he at once adjourns it to
the following meeting day. May, Parl.Prac. 219.

## COUNTEE

In old English law. The most emi-
nent dignity of a subject before the Conquest. He

## COUNTENANCE

In old English law. Credit;
estimation. Wharton. Also, encouragement; aid-
ing and abetting. Cooper v. Johnson, 81 Mo. 487.

application.

feasance common in the civil law. It is executed
by a party who has taken a deed of property, ab-
solute on its face, but intended as security for a
loan of money, and by it he agrees to reconvey
the property on payment of a specified sum. The
two instruments, taken together, constitute what
is known in Louisiana as an "antichresis," (q. v.).
Karcher v. Karcher, 138 La. 288, 70 So. 228, 229;
Livingston v. Story, 11 Pet. 351, 9 L.Ed. 746.

another; a countervailing bond of indemnity.

## COUNTERCLAIM

A claim presented by a de-
fendant in opposition to or deduction from the
claim of the plaintiff. A species of set-off or re-
coupment introduced by the codes of civil pro-
cedure in many of the states, of a broad and lib-
eral character. Quoted in Wollan v. McKay, 24
Idaho, 691, 135 P. 832, 837.
It is an offensive as well as a defensive plea, which is
not necessarily confined to the justice of plaintiff's claim,
and it represents the right of the defendant to have the

Civ.Proc. rules 8, 13, 28 U.S.C.A., "counterclaim" means
any claim, not such as to constitute a set-off, which, in
equity, a defendant might assert against the plaintiff in
the same suit. Terry Steam Turbine Co. v. B. F. Sturte-
vant Co., D.C.Mass., 204 F. 103, 105.
A counterclaim may be any cause of action in favor of
defendants or some of them against plaintiffs or some of
them, a person whom a plaintiff represents or a plaintiff
and another person or persons alleged to be liable. New
York Civ.Prac.Act, § 266.
A "counterclaim" must be a cause of action, and seeks
affirmative relief, while a defense merely defeats the plain-
tiff's cause of action by a denial or confession and avoid-
ance, and does not admit of affirmative relief to the defend-
ant. Lovett v. Lovett, 93 Fla. 611, 112 So. 768, 780; Secor
v. Siver, 165 Iowa, 673, 146 N.W. 845, 847.

ends together and cause them to slip by each oth-
er and overlap, especially when the break is ob-
lique across bone, "counterextension" denotes the

ther continuance of the order or instruction, as
where a new order is given inconsistent with the
former order.

## COUNTERPART

In conveyancing. The cor-
responding part of an instrument; a duplicate or
copy. Where an instrument of conveyance, as a
lease, is executed in parts, that is, by having sev-
eral copies or duplicates made and interchange-
ably executed, that which is executed by the gran-
tor is usually called the "original," and the rest
are "counterparts"; although, where all the par-
ties execute every part, this renders them all orig-
inals. 2 Bl. Comm. 296; Shep. Touch. 50. Roose-
velt v. Smith, 17 Misc.Rep. 323, 40 N.Y.S. 381.

some right to it existed in one person but the ac-
tual possession was in another; and the posses-
sion in such case was said to "countervail livery,"

possession required in other cases. Miller V.

## COUNTRY

The portion of the earth's surface
occupied by an independent nation or people, or
the inhabitants of such territory.
In its primary meaning "country" signifies "place;"
and, in a larger sense, the territory or dominions occupied
by a community; or even waste and unpeopled sections or
regions of the earth. But its metaphorical meaning is no
less definite and well understood; and in common par-
lance, in historical and geographical writings, in diplo-
macy, legislation, treaties, and international codes, the
word is employed to denote the population, the nation, the
state, or the government, having possession and dominion
474; U. S. v. Recorder, 1 Blatchf. 218, 225, 5 N.Y.Leg.Obs.
286, Fed.Cas.No.16,129.
The word "country" as used in treaties made by the
United States government, in so far as it applies to the
United States, means the states of such country. Pagano
v. Cerri, 93 Ohio St. 345, 112 N.E. 1037, 1039, L.R.A.1917A,

Within stat-
ute providing for deportation of aliens means
country of alien's nativity, where domicile has
not been acquired elsewhere. Immigration Act
1924, § 13, 8 U.S.C.A. § 213; 8 U.S.C.A. § 156.
Schenck ex rel. Capodilupo v. Ward, C.C.A.Mass.,
80 F.2d 422, 426.
Term means the country territorially rather than gov-
ernmentally from which the alien came. Immigration Act
1917, § 20, 8 U.S.C.A. § 156. Moraitis v. Delany, D.C.Md.,
46 F.Supp. 425, 430.

would be complied with if the alien was returned
to political dominion in exile and control of coun-
try from whence he came. Delany v. Moraitis,
C.C.A.Md., 136 F.2d 129, 130, 131, 132, 133.

## COUNTY

One of the civil divisions of a country
for judicial and political purposes. 1 Bla. Comm.
Etymologically, it denotes that portion of the country
under the immediate government of a count or earl. 1 Bla.
Comm. 116.
One of the principal subdivisions of the kingdom of
England and of most of the states of the American Union,
denoting a distinct portion of territory organized by itself
for political and judicial purposes. In modern use, the
word may denote either the territory marked off to form a
county, or the citizens resident within such territory, taken
collectively and considered as invested with political rights,
or the county regarded as a municipal corporation possess-
ing subordinate governmental powers, or an organized
jural society invested with specific rights and duties.
Eagle v. Beard, 33 Ark. 501; Wooster v. Plymouth, 62 N.H.
208; In re Becker, 179 App. Div. 789, 167 N.Y.S. 118, 119;
Greb v. King County, 187 Wash. 587, 60 P.2d 690, 692.
In the English law, this word signifies the same as shire,
-county being derived from the French, and shire from
the Saxon. Both these words signify a circuit or portion
of the realm into which the whole land is divided, for the
better government thereof and the more easy administra-
tion of justice. There is no part of England that is not
within some county; and the shirereeve (sheriff) was the
governor of the province, under the comes, earl, or count.
Counties are political subdivisions of the state, created to
aid in the administration of state law for the purpose of
local self-government. Hunt v. Mohave County, 18 Ariz.
480, 162 P. 600, 602; Board of Com'rs of Osborne County
v. City of Osborne, 104 Kan. 671, 180 P. 233, 234; Divide

kins v. Board of Com'rs of Cook County, 271 Ill. 449, 111
N.E. 580, 584, Ann.Cas.1917A, 27. Other cases, seeking to
distinguish between the two, say that counties are agencies
or political subdivisions of the state for governmental pur-
of the inhabitants of specified regions for purposes of local
government. Dillwood v. Riecks, 42 Cal.App. 602, 184 P.
35, 37; Bexar County v. Linden, 110 Tex. 339, 220 S.W.

County court. A court of high antiquity in
England, incident to the jurisdiction of the sher-
iff. It is not a court of record, but may hold pleas
of debt or damages, under the value of forty shill-

termed the "suitors" of the court) are the real
judges in this court, and the sheriff is the minis-

Comm. 395. But in modern English law the name
is appropriated to a system of tribunals estab-
lished by the statute 9 & 10 Vict. c. 95, having a

said to be done against their peace, and not, as in
other places, contra pacem domini regis. But
these privileges have in modern times nearly dis-

## COUPLED WITH AN INTEREST

This phrase,
in the law of agency, has reference to a writing
creating, •conveying to, or vesting in the agent an
interest in the estate or property which is the
subject of the agency, as distinguished from the
proceeds or profits resulting from the exercise of
the agency. George H. Rucker & Co. v. Glennan,
130 Va. 511, 107 S.E. 725, 728.

## COUPONS

Interest and dividend certificates;
also those parts of a commercial instrument which
are to be cut, and which are evidence of some-
thing connected with the contract mentioned in
the instrument. They are generally attached to
certificates of loan, where the interest is payable
at particular periods, and, when the interest is
paid, they are cut off and delivered to the payer.
Wharton. Toon v. Wapinitia Irr. Co., 117 Or. 374,
243 P. 554, 556.
In England, they are known as warrants or div-
idend warrants, and the securities to which they
belong, debentures; 13 C. B. 372.
Coupons are written contracts for the payment of a
d3finite sum of money on a given day, and being drawn
and executed in a form and mode for the purpose, that
they may be separated from the bonds and other instru-
ments to which they are usually attached, it is held that
they are negotiable and that a suit may be maintained on
them without the necessity of producing the bonds. Each
matured coupon upon a negotiable bond is a separable
promise, distinct from the promises to pay the bonds or the
other coupons, and gives rise to a separate cause of action.
Aurora v. West, 7 Wall. 88, 19 L.Ed. 42. Haven v. Depot
Co., 109 Mass. 88; Thompson v. Perrine, 106 U.S. 589, 1

Coupon notes. Promissory notes with coupons
attached, the coupons being notes for interest
written at the bottom of the principal note, and

In Workmen's Compensation Acts, the usual course of
business of the employer covers the normal operations
which form part of the ordinary business carried on, and
not Including incidental and occasional operations having

appliances used in the business. Walker v. Industrial
Accident Commission, 177 Cal. 737, 171 P. 954, 955, L.R.A.
1918F, 212.
Commercial paper is said to be transferred, or sales
alleged to have been fraudulent may be shown to have
been made, "in the course of business," or "in the usual
and ordinary course of business," when the circumstances
of the transaction are such as usually and ordinarily attend
dealings of the same kind and do not exhibit any signs of
haste, secrecy, or fraudulent intention. Walbrun v. Bab-
bitt, 16 Wall. 581, 21 L.Ed. 489; Brooklyn, etc., R. Co. v.

v. Town of Mooresville, 222 N.C. 283, 22 S.E.2d
907, 910. A workman is in course of employ-
ment when, within time covered by employment,
he is doing something which he might reasonably
do while so employed at proper place. Dambold
v. Industrial Commission, 323 Ill. 377, 154 N.E.

In order that an injury may arise out of and in the
course of employment, it must be received while the work-
man is doing the duty he is employed to perform and also
as a natural incident of the work flowing therefrom as a
natural consequence and directly connected therewith. Di
Salvio v. Menihan Co., 225 N.Y. 123, 121 N.E. 766, 767.
"In course of employment," as used in Workmen's Com-
pensation Act, means in service of master, and is not syn-
onymous with "during the period covered by his actual.
employment." An injury, to be within course of employ-
ment, must occur during hours of employment, which
includes hours of leisure set apart in working hours for
rest, recreation, or refreshment, but not time when
employee is off premises, not engaged in employer's busi-
ness, or at home preparing for work, or coming to or
leaving work. Shofiler v. Lehigh Valley Coal Co., 290 Pa.
480, 139 A. 192, 193. An employee, even after closing time,
is in the "course of employment" until a suitable oppor-
tunity has been given for him to leave the place of work.
Field v. Charmette Knitted Fabric Co., 245 N.Y. 139, 156
N.E. 642, 643; Munn v. Industrial Board, 274 Ill. 70, 113
N.E. 110, 112.

the rule that a master is liable for the torts of his servant
done in the course of his employment, means while
engaged in the service of the master, while engaged gen-
erally in the master's work, as distinguished from acts
done when the servant steps outside of his employment to
do an act for himself, not connected with his master's
business. Sina v. Carlson, 120 Minn. 283, 139 N.W. 601, 602.
And see Birmingham Ledger Co. v. Buchanan, 10 Ala.App.
527, 65 So. 667, 670.

Employment.

## COURSE OF RIVER

The course of a river is a
line parallel with its banks; the term is not syn-
onymous with the "current" of the river. Attor-
COURSE OF THE VOYAGE. By this term is un-
derstood the regular and customary track, if such
there be, which a ship takes in going from one
port to another, and the shortest way. Marsh.
Ins. 185; Phi11. Ins. 981.

## COURSE OF TRADE

What is customarily or
ordinarily done in the management of trade or
business.

## COURSE OF VEIN

In mining, the "course of
the vein" appearing on the surface is the course
of its apex, which is generally inclined and un-
dulated and departs more or less materially from
the strike. Stewart Mining Co. v. Bourne, C.C.A.
Idaho, 218 F. 327, 329.

## COURSE OF VESSEL

In navigation, the
"course" of a vessel is her apparent course, and
not her heading at any given moment. The East-
ern Glade, C.C.A.N.Y., 101 F.2d A, 6. It is her ac-
tual course. Liverpool, Brazil & River Plate
Steam Nay. Co. v. U. S., D.C.N.Y., 12 F.2d 128,
COURT. A space which is uncovered, but which
may be partly or wholly inclosed by buildings or
walls. Smith v. Martin, 95 Okl. 271, 219 P. 312,
313. When used in connection with a street, in-
dicates a short street, blind alley, or open space
like a short street inclosed by dwellings or other
buildings facing thereon. City of Miami v. Saun-
ders, 151 Fla. 699, 10 So.2d 326, 329.
Legislation
A legislative assembly. Parliament is called
In the old books a court of the king, nobility, and
commons assembled. Finch, Law, b. 4, c. 1, p.
233; Fleta, lib. 2, c. 2.
The application of the term—which originally denoted
the place of assembling—to denote the assemblage, resem-
bles the similar application of the Latin term curia, and
is readily explained by the fact that the earlier courts were
merely assemblages, in the court-yard of the baron or of
the king himself, of those who were qualified and whose
duty it was so to appear at stated times or upon summons.
Traces of this usage and constitution of courts still remain
in the courts baron, the various courts for the trial of
Impeachments in England and the United States, and in
the control exercised by the parliament of England and
the legislatures of the various states of the United States
over the organization of courts of justice, as constituted in
modern times. This meaning of the word has also been
retained in the titles of some deliberative bodies, such as
the "general court" of Massachusetts, i. e., the legislature.
International Law
The person and suite of the sovereign; the place
where the sovereign sojourns with his regal re-
tinue, wherever that may be. The English gov-
ernment is spoken of in diplomacy as the court of
St. James, because the palace of St. James is the
official palace.
Practice
An organ of the government, belonging to the
judicial department, whose function is the appli-
cation of the laws to controversies brought before
it and the public administration of justice. White
County v. Gwin, 136 Ind. 562, 36 N.E. 237, 22 L.
R.A. 402; Bradley v. Town of Bloomfield, 85 N.J.
Law, 506, 89 A. 1009.
The presence of a sufficient number of the mem-
bers of such a body regularly convened in an au-
thorized place at an appointed time, engaged in
the full and regular performance of its functions.

ner, 20 Ala. 446.
A body in the government to which the admin-
istration of justice is delegated. A body organiz-

indirectly under its authority, consisting of one or more
officers, established and maintained for the purpose of
hearing and determining issues of law and fact regarding
legal rights and alleged violations thereof, and of applying
the sanctions of the law, authorized to exercise its powers
in due course of law at times and places previously deter-
mined by lawful authority. Isbill v. Stovall, Tex.Civ.App.,

126, 140 N.E. 510, 512. An organized body with defined
powers, meeting at certain times and places for the hear-
ing and decision of causes and other matters brought
before it, and aided in this, its proper business, by Its
proper officers, viz., attorneys and counsel to present and
manage the business, clerks to record and attest its acts
and decisions, and ministerial officers to execute its com-
mands, and secure due order in its proceedings. Ex parte

ed. Co. Litt. 58a; 3 Bl. Comm. 23. Railroad Co.
v. Harden, 113 Ga. 456, 38 S.E. 950; Croft v. Croft,
119 N.J.Eq. 468, 182 A. 853.
The judge, or the body of judges, presiding over
a court.
The words "court" and "judge," or "judges," are fre-
quently used in statutes as synonymous. When used with
reference to orders made by the court or judges, they are
to be so understood. State v. Caywood, 96 Iowa, 367, 65
N.W. 385; Sale v. Railroad Commission, 15 Ca1.2d 612, 104
P.2d 38, 41.
The word "court" is often employed in statutes other-
wise than in its strict technical sense, and is applied to
various tribunals not judicial in their character, State v.
Howat, 107 Kan. 423, 191 P. 585, 589; for example, in New
Jersey, the "court of pardons"; In re Court of Pardons, 97
N.J.Eq. 555, 129 A. 624, 625.
Classification
Courts may be classified and divided according
to several methods, the following being the more
usual:
Courts of record and courts not of record. The
former being those whose acts and judicial pro-
ceedings are enrolled, or recorded, for a perpetual
fine or imprison for contempt. Error lies to their
judgments, and they generally possess a seal.
Courts not of record are those of inferior dignity,
which have no power to fine or imprison, and in
which the proceedings are not enrolled or record-
ed. 3 Bl. Comm. 24; 3 Steph. Comm. 383; The
Thomas Fletcher, C.C.Ga., 24 F. 481; Ex parte
Thistleton, 52 Cal. 225; Erwin v. U. S., D.C.Ga.,
37 F. 488, 2 L.R.A. 229; Heininger v. Davis, 96
Ohio St. 205, 117 N.E. 229, 231.
A "court of record" is a judicial tribunal having attri-
butes and exercising functions independently of the person
of the magistrate designated generally to hold it, and
proceeding according to the course of common law, its acts
and proceedings being enrolled for a perpetual memorial.
Jones v. Jones, 188 Mo.App. 220, 175 S.W. 227, 229; Ex
parte Gladhill, 8 Metc., Mass., 171, per Shaw, C. J. See,
also, Ledwith v. Rosalsky, 244 N.Y. 406, 155 N.E. 688, 689.
Courts may be at the same time of record for some pur-
poses and not of record for others. Lester v. Redmond, 6
Hill, N.Y., 590; Ex parte Gladhill, 8 Metc., Mass., 168.
Superior and inferior courts. The former being
courts of general original jurisdiction in the first
instance, and which exercise a control or super-
vision over a system of lower courts, either by ap-
peal, error, or certiorari; the latter being courts
of small or restricted jurisdiction, and subject to
the review or correction of higher courts. Some-
times the former term is used to denote a par-
ticular group or system of courts of high powers,
and all others are called "inferior courts."
To constitute a court a superior court as to any class of
actions, within the common-law meaning of that term, its
jurisdiction of such actions must be unconditional, so that
the only thing requisite to enable the court to take cog-
nizance of them is the acquisition of jurisdiction of the
persons of the parties. Simons v. De Bare, 4 Bosw., N.Y.,
An inferior court is a court whose judgments or decrees
can be reviewed, on appeal or writ of error, by a higher
tribunal, whether that tribunal be the circuit or supreme
court. Nugent v. State, 18 Ala. 521.
Civil and criminal courts. The former being
such as are established for the adjudication of con-
troversies between subject and subject, or the as-
certainment, enforcement, and redress of private
rights; the latter, such as are charged with the
administration of the criminal laws, and the pun-
ishment of wrongs to the public.
Equity courts and law courts. The former be-
ing such as possess the jurisdiction of a chancel-
lor, apply the rules and principles of chancery law,
and follow the procedure in equity; the latter,
such as have no equitable powers, but administer
justice according to the rules and practice of the
common law.
As to the division of courts according to their
jurisdiction, see Jurisdiction.
As to several names or kinds of courts not spe-
cifically described in the titles immediately fol-
lowing, see Arches Court, Appellate, Circuit
Courts, Consistory Courts, County, Customary

lice Court, Prerogative Court, Prize Court, Pro-
bate Court, Superior Courts, Supreme Court, and

al order infra.
General
Court above, court below. In appellate prac-
tice, the "court above" is the one to which a cause
is removed for review, whether by appeal, writ of
error, or certiorari; while the "court below" is
the one from which the case is removed. Going
v. Schnell, 6 Ohio Dec. 933.
Court in bank. A meeting of all the judges of
a court, usually for the purpose of hearing argu-
ments on demurrers, points reserved, motions for
new trial, etc., as distinguished from sessions of
the same court presided over by a single judge or
justice.

power and authority of law at the time of acting
to do the particular act. Ex parte Plaistridge, 68
Okl. 256, 173 P. 646, 647.

laws to determine the question in controversy. Texas
Employers' Ins. Ass'n v. Nunamaker, Tex.Civ.App., 267
S. W. 749, 751. A court for the administration of justice as
established by the Constitution or statute. Bradley v.
Town of Bloomfield, 85 N.J.Law, 506, 89 A. 1009.
Court of limited jurisdiction. When a court
of general jurisdiction proceeds under a special
statute, it is a "court of limited jurisdiction" for
the purpose of that proceeding, and its jurisdic-
tion must affirmatively appear. Osage Oil & Re-
fining Co. v. Interstate Pipe Co., 124 Okl. 7, 253 P.
66, 71.
De facto court. One established, organized, and
exercising its judicial functions under authority
of a statute apparently valid, though such statute
may be in fact unconstitutional and may be after-
wards so adjudged; or a court established and
acting under the authority of a de facto govern-
ment. 1 Bl. Judgm. § 173; In re Manning, 139
U.S. 504, 11 S.Ct. 624, 35 L.Ed. 264; Gildemeister

## COURT-BARON

In English law. A court
which, although not one of record, is incident to
every manor, and cannot be severed therefrom.
It was ordained for the maintenance of the serv-
ices and duties stipulated for by lords of manors,
and for the purpose of determining actions of a
personal nature, where the debt or damage was
under forty shillings. Wharton; 1 Poll. & Maitl.
Hist. E. L. 580.
Customary court-baron is one appertaining en-
tirely to copyholders. 3 Bl.Comm. 33.
Freeholders' court-baron is one held before the
freeholders who owe suit and service to the man-
or. It is the court-baron proper.
Coke (1st Inst. 58a) speaks of the Court Baron as being
of the two natures just indicated. Blackstone, 3 Comm. 33,
says that, though in their nature distinct, they are fre-
quently confounded together. Later writers doubt if there
were two courts; 1 Poll. & Maitl.Hist.E.L. 580.

## COURT CHRISTIAN

The ecclesiastical courts
in England are often so called, as distinguished
from the civil courts. 1 Bl. Comm. 83; 3 Bl.
Comm. 64; 3 Steph. Comm. 430.

## COURT FOR CONSIDERATION OF CROWN CASES RESERVED

A court established by St.
11 & 12 Vict. c. 78, composed of such of the judges
of the superior courts of Westminster as were able
to attend, for the consideration of questions of
law reserved by any judge in a court of oyer and
terminer, gaol delivery, or quarter sessions, be-
fore which a prisoner had been found guilty by
verdict. Such question is stated in the form of
a special case. Mozley & Whiteley; 4 Steph.
Comm. 442. The trial judge was empowered to
"state a case" for the opinion of that court. He
could not be compelled to do so, and only a ques-
tion of law could be raised. If the court consid-
ered that the point had been wrongly decided at
the trial, the conviction would be quashed. By
Act of 1907, the Court of Criminal Appeal was
created and the Court for Crown Cases Reserved
was abolished.

## COURT FOR DIVORCE AND MATRIMONIAL CAUSES

This court was established by St. 20
& 21 Vict. c. 85, which transferred to it all juris-
diction then exercisable by any ecclesiastical court
in England, in matters matrimonial, and also gave
it new powers. The court consisted of the lord
chancellor, the three chiefs, and three senior
puisne judges of the common-law courts, and the
judge ordinary, who together constituted, and
still constitute, the "full court." The judge ordi-
nary heard almost all matters in the first instance.
By the judicature act, 1873, § 3, the jurisdiction
of the court was transferred to the supreme court
of judicature. Sweet.
COURT FOR THE CORRECTION OF ERRORS.
The style of a court having jurisdiction for re-
view, by appeal or writ of error. The name was
formerly used in New York and South Carolina.

## COURT FOR THE RELIEF OF INSOLVENT DEBTORS

In English law. A local court which
had its • sittings in London only, which received
the petitions of insolvent debtors, and decided
upon the question of granting a discharge. See
3 Steph. Com. 426; 4 id. 287. Abolished by the
Bankruptcy Act of 1861.
COURT FOR THE TRIAL OF IMPEACHMENTS.
A tribunal empowered to try any officer of gov-
ernment or other person brought to its bar by the
process of impeachment. In England, the house
of lords constitutes such a court; in the United
States, the senate; and in the several states, usu-
ally the upper house of the legislative assembly.
peculiar hand in which the records of courts were
written from the earliest period down to the reign
of George II. Its characteristics were great
strength, compactness, and undeviating uniform-
ity; and its use undoubtedly gave to the ancient
record its acknowledged superiority over the mod-
ern, in tile important quality of durability.
The writing of this hand, with its peculiar ab-
breviations and contractions, constituted, while it
was in use, an art of no little importance, being
an indispensable part of the profession of "clerk-
ship," as it was called. Two sizes of it were em-
ployed, a large and a small hand; the former,
called "great court-hand," being used for initial
words or clauses, the placita of records, etc. Bur-
rill.

## COURT-HOUSE

The building occupied for the
public sessions of a court, with its various offices.
The building occupied and appropriated according
to law for the holding of courts. Board of Sup'rs
of Stone County v. O'Neal, 130 Miss. 57, 93 So. 483,
484. Johnson City Buick -Co. v. Johnson, 165
Tenn. 349, 54 S.W.2d 946.
The term may be used of a place temporarily occupied
for the sessions of a court, though not the recrular court-
house. Harris v. State, 72 Miss. 960, 18 So. 387, 33 L.R.A.
85; Vigo County v. Stout, 136 Ind. 53, 35 N.E. 683, 22
L. R. A. 398.

lord's hands to serve his family.

## COURT-LEET

The name of an English court
of record held once in the year, and not oftener,
within a particular hundred, lordship, or manor,
before the steward of the leet; being the king's
court granted by charter to the lords of those
hundreds or manors. Its office was to view the
frankpledges,—that is, the freemen within the
liberty; to present by jury crimes happening with-
in the jurisdiction; and to punish trivial misde-
meanors. It has now, however, for the most part,
fallen into total desuetude; though in some man-
ors a court-leet is still periodically held for the
transaction of the administrative business of the
manor. Mozley & Whitley; Odgers, C. L. 965;
Powell, Courts Leet; 1 Reeve, Hist. Eng. Law;
Inderwick, King's Peace, 11; 1 Poll. & Maitl. 568;
4 Steph. Com. 306.

## COURT-MARTIAL

A military court, convened
under authority of government and the Uniform
Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C.A. § 801 et seq.,
for trying and punishing offenses committed by
members of the armed forces.
Such courts exist and have their jurisdiction by
virtue of the military law, the court being con-
stituted and empowered to act in each instance
by authority from a commanding officer.
risdiction of causes arising under the rules of ad-
miralty law. See Admiralty.
High Court of Admiralty. In English law.
This was a court which exercised jurisdiction in
prize cases, and had general jurisdiction in mari-
time causes, on the instance side. Its proceedings
were usually in rem, and its practice and princi-
ples derived in large measure from the civil law.
The judicature acts of 1873 transferred all the
powers and jurisdiction of this tribunal to the
probate, divorce, and admiralty division of the
high court of justice.

## COURT OF ANCIENT DEMESNE

In English
law. A court of peculiar constitution, held by a
bailiff appointed by the king, in which alone the
tenants of the king's demesne could be impleaded.
2 Burrows, 1046; 1 Spence, Eq.Jur. 100; 2 Bl.
Comm. 99; 1 Steph. Comm. 224; 1 Poll. & Maitl.

## COURT OF APPEAL, HIS MAJESTY'S

The
chief appellate tribunal of England. It was es-
tablished by the judicature acts of 1873 and 1875,
and is invested with the jurisdiction formerly ex-
ercised by the court of appeal in chancery, the ex-
chequer chamber, the judicial committee of the
privy council in admiralty and lunacy appeals,
and with general appellate jurisdiction from the
high court of justice.

## COURT OF APPEALS

In American law. An
appellate tribunal which, in Kentucky, Maryland,
the District of Columbia, and New York, is the
court of last resort. In Virginia and West Vir-
ginia, it is known as the "supreme court of ap-
peals"; in Connecticut, the Supreme Court of Er-
rors; in Massachusetts and Maine, the Supreme
Judicial Court. In other states the court of last
resort is known as the Supreme Court. In Texas
the Courts of Civil Appeals are inferior to the su-
preme court.
The United States is divided into eleven judicial
circuits in each of which there is established a
court of appeals known as the United States Court
of Appeals for the circuit. 28 U.S.C.A. §§ 41, 43.
COURT OF APPEALS IN CASES OF CAPTURE.
A court erected by act of congress under the ar-
ticles of confederation which preceded the adop-
tion of the constitution. It had appellate juris-
diction in prize causes.

## COURT OF ARBITRATION OF THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE

A court of arbitrators, creat-
ed for the convenience of merchants in the city
of New York, by act of the legislature of New
York. It decides disputes between members of
the chamber of commerce, and between members
and outside merchants who voluntarily submit
themselves to the jurisdiction of the court.

## COURT OF ARCHDEACON

The most inferior
of the English ecclesiastical courts, from which
an appeal generally lies to that of the bishop (i.
e., to the Consistory Court). 3 Bl. Comm. 64; 1
Holdsw. Hist. E. L. 369,
chusetts organized in 1630, consisting of the gov-
ernor, deputy governor and assistants. It exer-
cised the whole power both legislative and judicial
of the colony and an extensive chancery jurisdic-
tion as well. S. D. Wilson in 18 Am.L.Rev. 226.

## COURT OF ATTACHMENTS

The lowest of the
three courts held in the forests. It has fallen in-
to total disuse.
It was held before the verderers of the forest once in
every forty days, to view the attachments by the foresters
for offences against the vert and the venison. It had cog-
nizance only of small trespasses. Larger ones were
enrolled and heard by the Justices in Eyre. 1 Holdsw.
Hist.E.L. 343.

## COURT OF AUDIENCE

An ecclesiastical court,
in which the primates once exercised in person a
considerable part of their jurisdiction. Such
courts seem to be now obsolete, or at least to be
only used on the rare occurrence of the trial of a
bishop. Phillim. Ecc. Law, 1201, 1204; 1 Holdsw.
Hist. E. L. 371.

## COURT OF AUGMENTATION

An English
court created in the time of Henry VIII (27 Hen.

## VIII

, c. 27), with jurisdiction over the property
and revenue of certain religious foundations,
which had been made over to the king by act of
parliament, and over suits relating to the same.
It was called "The Court of the Augmentations of the
Revenues of the King's Crown" (from the augmentation of
the revenues of the crown derived from the suppression of
the monasteries), and was dissolved in the reign of Queen
Mary, but the Office of Augmentation remained long after;
the records of the court are now at the Public Record
Office. Cowell.

## COURT OF BANKRUPTCY

An English court
of record, having original and appellate jurisdic-
tion in matters of bankruptcy, and invested with
both legal and equitable powers for that purpose.
The Bankrupt Law Consolidation Act, 1849. By
the judicature acts, 1873 and 1875, the court of
bankruptcy was consolidated into the supreme
court of judicature.
In the United States, the Bankruptcy Act, § 1.
(10), 11 U.S.C.A. § 1(10), as amended, provides
that " 'courts of bankruptcy' shall include the dis-
trict courts of the United States and of the Ter-
ritories and possessions to which this title is or
may hereafter be applicable, and the District
Court of the United States for the District of Co-
lumbia."

## COURT OF BROTHERHOOD

An assembly of
the mayors or other chief officers of the principal
towns of the Cinque Ports in England, originally
administering the chief powers of those ports,
now almost extinct. Cent. Diet.

## COURT OF CHANCERY

A court having the ju-
risdiction of a chancellor; a court administering
equity and proceeding according to the forms and
principles of equity. In England, prior to the ju-
dicature acts, the style of the court possessing the
largest equitable powers and jurisdiction was the
"high court of chancery." In some of the United
States, the title "court of chancery" is applied to
a court possessing general equity powers, distinct
from the courts of common law. Parmeter v.
Bourne, 8 Wash. 45, 35 P. 586; Bull v. Interna-
tional Power Co., 84 N.J.Eq. 209, 93 A. 86, 88.
The terms "equity" and "chancery," "court of equity"
and "court of chancery," are constantly used as synony-
mous in the United States. It is presumed that this custom
arises from the circumstance that the equity jurisdiction
which is exercised by the courts of the various states is
assimilated to that possessed by the English courts of chan-
cery. Indeed, in some of the states it is made identical
therewith by statute, so far as conformable to our institu-
tions. Wagner v. Armstrong, 93 Ohio St. 443, 113 N.E.
397, 401.

## COURT OF CHIVALRY

In English law. The
name of a court anciently held as a court of hon-
or merely, before the earl-marshal, and as a crim-
inal court before the lord high constable, jointly
with the earl-marshal. (But it is, also said that
this court was held by the constable, and after
that office reverted to the crown in the time of
Henry VIII., by the earl-marshal. Davis, Mil.
Law 13.) 3 Bl.Comm. 68; 4 Broom & H. Comm.
360, note; 3 Bl. Comm. 103; 3 Steph. Comm. 335,
note l; 7 Mod. 137.
It had jurisdiction as to contracts and other matters.
touching deeds of arms or war, as well as pleas of life or
member. It also corrected encroachments in matters of
coat-armor, precedency, and other distinctions of families.
It is now grown entirely out of use, on account of the
feebleness of its jurisdiction and want of power to enforce
its judgments, as it could neither fine nor imprison, not
being a court of record.

## COURT OF CLAIMS

One of the courts of the
United States, established in 1855. U. S. v. Klein,
13 Wall., U.S., 128, 144, 20 L.Ed. 519. It consists
of a chief justice and four associates, and holds
one annual session. It is located at Washington.
Its jurisdiction extends to all claims against the
United States arising out of any contract with the
government or based on an act of congress or
regulation of the executive, and all claims referred
to it by either house of congress, as well as to
claims for exoneration by a disbursing officer. Its
judgments are, in certain cases, reviewable by the
United States supreme court. It has no equity
powers. Its decisions are reported and published.
This name is also given, in some of the states, either to
a special court or to the ordinary county court sitting "as
a court of claims," having the special duty of auditing and
ascertaining the claims against the county and expenses
incurred by it, and providing for their payment by appro-
priations out of the county levy or annual tax. Merl-
weather v. Muhlenburg County Court, 120 U.S. 354, 7 S.Ct.
563, 30 L.Ed. 653.
COURT OF COMMISSIONERS OF SEWERS.
The name of certain English courts created by
commission under the great seal pursuant to the
statute of sewers (23 Hen. VIII. c. 5).

## COURT OF COMMON PLEAS

In English law.
One of the four superior courts at Westminster,
which existed up to the passing of the judicature
acts. It was also styled the "Common Bench." It
was one of the courts derived from the breaking
up of the aula regis, and had exclusive jurisdic-
tion of all real actions and of communia placita,
or common pleas, i. e., between subject and sub-
ject. It was presided over by a chief justice with
four puisne judges (later five, by virtue of 31 & 32
Vict. c. 125, § 11, subsec. 8). Appeals lay anciently
to the king's bench, but afterwards to the exche-
quer chamber. See 3 Bl.Comm. 37, et seq. Its
jurisdiction was altogether confined to civil mat-
ters, having no cognizance in criminal cases, and
was concurrent with that of the queen's bench
and exchequer in personal actions and ejectment.
Wharton.
In American law. The name sometimes given
to a court of original and general jurisdiction for
the trial of issues of fact and law according to the
principles of the common law. Moore v. Barry,
30 S.C. 530, 9 S.E. 589, 4 L.R.A. 294.

## COURT OF COMMON PLEAS FOR THE CITY AND COUNTY OF NEW YORK

The oldest
court in the state of New York, no longer in ex-
istence.

## COURT OF CONCILIATION

A court which
proposes terms of adjustment, so as to avoid liti-
gation. Kashefsky v. Futernick, 153 Misc. 733,
276 N.Y.S. 253.

## COURT OF CONSCIENCE

The same as courts
of request, (q. v.). This name is also frequently
applied to the courts of equity or of chancery,
not as a name but as a description. Harper v.
Clayton, 84 Md. 346, 35 A. 1083, 35 L.R.A. 211.
And see Conscience.

## COURT OF CONVOCATION

In English eccle-
siastical law. A court, or assembly, comprising
all the high officials of each province and repre-
sentatives of the minor clergy. It is in the na-
ture of an ecclesiastical parliament; and, so far
as its judicial functions extend, it has jurisdic-
tion of cases of heresy, schism, and other purely
ecclesiastical matters. An appeal lies to the king
in council. 2 & 3 Will. IV. c. 92; Cowell; Bac.
Abr. Ecclesiastical Courts, A, 1; 1 Bla. Comm.
279; 2 Steph. Com. 525, 668; 2 Burn, Eccl. Law,
18. Convocation exercises no jurisdiction at the
present day. 1 Holdsw. Hist. E. L. 373.

## COURT OF COUNTY COMMISSIONERS

In
some states, a court of record in each county.
Thus, in Alabama, it is composed of the judge of
probate, as principal judge, and four commission-
ers, who are elected at the times prescribed by
law, and hold office for four years.
COURT OF CUSTOMS AND PATENT APPEALS.
The title given by Act Mar. 2, 1929, c. 488, § 1, 45
Stat. 1475, to a court of the United States created
by Act Aug. 5, 1909, c. 6, § 28, 36 Stat. 91, 105, and
then known as the Court of Customs Appeals, con-
sisting of a presiding judge and four associate
judges. In patent and trade-mark cases it has the
appellate jurisdiction which prior to April 1, 1929,
was vested in the Court of Appeals of the District
of Columbia. Act Mar. 2, 1929, c. 488, § 2 (a, d) ,
45 Stat. 1476. As to its jurisdiction over appeals
from the "Customs Court," see that title.

## COURT OF DELEGATES

An English tribunal
composed of delegates appointed by royal com-
mission, and formerly the great court of appeal
in all ecclesiastical causes. The powers of the
court were, by 2 & 3 Wm. IV. c. 92, transferred
to the privy council. Brown; 3 Bl. Comm. 66; 1
Holdsw. Hist. E. L. 373.
A commission of review was formerly granted, in extra-
ordinary cases, to revise a sentence of the court of dele-
gates, when that court had apparently been led into
material error.

## COURT OF EQUITY

A court which has juris-
diction in equity, which administers justice and
decides controversies in accordance with the rules,
principles, and precedents of equity, and which
follows the forms and procedure of chancery; as
distinguished from a court having the jurisdic-
tion, rules, principles, and practice of the common
law. Thomas v. Phillips, 4 Smedes & M., Miss.,
COURT OF ERROR. An expression applied es
pecially to the court of exchequer chamber and the
house of lords, as taking cognizance of error
brought. Mozley & Whitley; 3 Steph. Comm. 333.
It is applied in some of the United States to the
court of last resort in the state; and in its most
general sense denotes any court having power to
review the decisions of lower courts on appeal,
error, certiorari, or other process. See Court of
Appeals.

## COURT OF ERRORS AND APPEALS

The
court of last resort in the state of New Jersey
is so named. Formerly, the same title was given
to the highest court of appeal in New York.

## COURT OF EXCHEQUER

In English law. A
very ancient court of record, set up by William
the Conqueror as a part of the aula regis, and
afterwards one of the four superior courts at
Westminster. It was, however, inferior in rank
to both the king's bench and the common pleas.
It was presided over by a chief baron and four
puisne barons. It was originally the king's treas-
ury, and was charged with keeping the king's
accounts and collecting the royal revenues. But
pleas between subject and subject were anciently
heard there, until this was forbidden by the Ar-
ticula super Chartas, (1290,) after which its ju-
risdiction as a court only extended to revenue
cases arising out of the non-payment or withhold-
ing of debts to the crown. But the privilege of
suing and being sued in this court was extended
to the king's accountants, and later, by the use of
a convenient fiction to the effect that the plaintiff
was the king's debtor or accountant, the court
was thrown open to all suitors in personal actions.
The exchequer had formerly both an equity side
and a common-law side, but its equity jurisdiction
was taken away by the statute 5 Vict. c. 5, (1842,)
and transferred to the court of chancery. The
judicature act (1873) transferred the business and
jurisdiction of this court to the "Exchequer Div-
ision" of the "High Court of Justice."
In Scotch law. A court which formerly had
jurisdiction of matters of revenue, and a limited
jurisdiction over cases between the crown and
its vassals where no questions of title were involv-
ed.

## COURT OF EXCHEQUER CHAMBER

The
name of a former English court of appeal, inter-
mediate between the superior courts of common
law and the house of lords. When sitting as a
court of appeal from any one of the three supe-
rior courts of common law, it was composed of
judges of the other two courts. 3 Bl.Comm. 56,
57; 3 Steph.Comm. 333, 356. By the judicature
act (1873) the jurisdiction of this court is trans-
ferred to the court of appeal.

## COURT OF FACULTIES

A tribunal of the arch-
bishop in England.
It does not hold pleas in any suits, but creates rights to
pews, monuments, and other mortuary matters. It had
also various other powers under 25 Hen. VIII. c. 2L Co.
4th Inst. 337; 2 Chit.Gen.Pr. 507.

## COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE

A court of pri-
mary jurisdiction. Courts of this title may be
found in the jurisprudence of the Philippine Is-
lands. 15 C.J. 688.

## COURT OF GENERAL QUARTER SESSIONS OF THE PEACE

In American law. A court
of criminal jurisdiction in New Jersey.
In English law. A court of criminal jurisdic-
tion, in England, held in each county once in every
quarter of a year, but in the county of Middlesex

held at other times than quarterly, the sessions
are called "general sessions of the peace." See
2 Odgers, C.L. 966.

## COURT OF GENERAL SESSIONS

The name
given in some states to a court of general orig-
inal jurisdiction in criminal cases.

## COURT OF GREAT SESSIONS IN WALES

A
court formerly held in Wales; abolished by 11
Geo. IV. and 1 Wm. IV. c. 70, and the Welsh judi-
cature incorporated with that of England. 3
Steph. Comm. 317, note; 3 Bla. Comm. 77.

## COURT OF GUESTLING

An assembly of the
members of the Court of Brotherhood (supra) to-
gether with other representatives of the corporate
members of the Cinque Ports, invited to sit with
the mayors of the seven principal towns. Cent.
Dict.

## COURT OF HIGH COMMISSION

In English
law. An ecclesiastical court of formidable juris-
diction, for the vindication of the peace and dig-
nity of the church, by reforming, ordering, and
correcting the ecclesiastical state and persons, and
all manner of errors, heresies, schisms, abuses,
offenses, contempts, and enormities. 3 Bl. Comm.
67. It was erected by St. 1 Eliz. c. 1, and abolish-
ed by 16 Car. I, c. 11. 1 Holdsw. Hist. E. L. 375.

## COURT OF HONOR

A court having jurisdiction
to hear and redress injuries or affronts to a man's
honor or personal dignity, of a nature not cogniza-
ble by the ordinary courts of law, or encroach-
ments upon his rights in respect to heraldry, coat-
armor, right of precedence, and the like. It was
one of the functions of the Court of Chivalry (q.
v.) in England to sit and act as a court of honor.
3 Bl. Comm. 104.
The name is also given in some European countries to a
tribunal of army officers (more or less distinctly recognized
by law as a "court") convened for the purpose of inquir-
ing into complaints affecting the honor of brother officers
and punishing derelictions from the code of honor and
deciding on the causes and occasions for fighting duels, in
which officers are concerned, and the manner of conduct-
ing them.

## COURT OF HUSTINGS

In English law. The
county court of London, held before the mayor,
recorder, and sheriff, but of which the recorder,
is, in effect, the sole judge. No actions can be
brought in this court that are merely personal.
3 Steph.Comm. 293, n.; 449, note 1; 3 Bla.Comm.
80, n.; Madox, Hist. Exch. c. 20; Co. 2d Inst.
327. Since the abolition of all real and mixed ac-
tions except ejectment, the jurisdiction of this
court has fallen into comparative desuetude.

whether it be proper to resort to extreme meas-
ures against a person charged before a court-
martial. 2 Steph.Comm. 590; 1 Coler.Bla.Comm.

the complaints of private soldiers. Moz. & W.
Diet.; Simmons, Cts.Mart. § 341.
In American law. Formerly, a court consti-
tuted by authority of the articles of war, invested
with the power to examine into the nature of any
transaction of, or accusation or imputation
against, any officer or soldier, when demanded by
him. Rev.St. § 1342, arts. 115, 116. Repealed by
Act June 4, 1920, c. 227, § 4, 41 Stat. 812.
They were not strictly courts, having no power to try
and determine guilt or innocence. They were rather
agencies created by statute to investigate facts and report
thereon. They could not compel the attendance of wit-
nesses nor require them to testify. Davis, Mil. Law 220.

## COURT OF JUSTICE SEAT

In English law.
The principal of the forest courts. Called also
Court of the Chief Justice in Eyre (q. v.).'
COURT OF JUSTICIARY. A Scotch court of
general criminal jurisdiction of all offenses com-

volving small amounts. An appeal lies to the
house of lords.

## COURT OF KING'S BENCH

In English law.
The supreme court of common law in the king-
dom, now merged in the high court of justice
under the judicature act of 1873, § 16.
It was one of the successors of the curia regis and
received its name, it is said, because the king formerly sat
in it in person. During the reign of a queen it was called
the Queen's Bench, and during Cromwell's Protectorate it
was called the Upper Bench.

## COURT OF LAW

In a wide sense, any duly con-
stituted tribunal administering the laws of the
state or nation; in a narrower sense, a court pro-
. ceeding according to the course of the common
law and governed by its rules and principles, as
contrasted with a "court of equity."
COURT OF LODEMANAGE. An ancient court
of the Cinque Ports, having jurisdiction in mari-
time matters, and particularly over pilots (lode-

inal offenses.

## COURT OF MARSHALSEA

In English law, the
court or seat of the marshal. A court originally
held before the steward and marshal of the king's
house, instituted to administer justice between the
king's domestic servants. It had jurisdiction of
all trespasses committed within the verge of the

royal household; and of all debts and contracts,
when both parties were of that establishment.
It was abolished by 12 & 13 Viet. c. 101, § 13.
Mozley & Whitley.

## COURT OF NISI PRIUS

In American law.
Though this term is frequently used as a general
designation of any court exercising general, orig..
inal jurisdiction in civil cases, (being used inter-
changeably with "trial-court,") it belonged as a
legal title only to a court which formerly existed
in the city and county of Philadelphia, and which
was presided over by one of the judges of the su-
preme court of Pennsylvania. This court was
abolished by the constitution of 1874. See Courts
of Assize and Nisi Prius.

## COURT OF ORDINARY

In some of the United
States (e. g., Georgia) the name given to the pro-
bate or surrogate's court, or the court having the
usual jurisdiction in respect to the proving of
wills and the administration of decedents' estates.
Veach v. Rice, 131 U.S. 293, 9 S.Ct. 730, 33 L.Ed.
163. Such a court formerly existed in New Jer-
sey, South Carolina, and Texas. 2 Kent 409.

## COURT OF ORPHANS

In English law. The
court of the lord mayor and aldermen of London,
which has the care of those orphans whose parent
died in London and was free of the city. It is
now said to be fallen into disuse. 2 Steph. Comm.
313; Pull. Cust. Lond. 196, Orphans' Court.
In American law. In Pennsylvania (and per-

court" is applied to that species of tribunal which
is elsewhere known as the "probate court" or
"surrogate's court."
COURT OF OYER AND TERMINER. In English
law. A court for the trial of cases of treason
and felony. The commissioners of assise and
nisi prius are judges selected by the king and ap-
pointed and authorized under the great seal, in-
cluding usually two of the judges at Westminster,
and sent out twice a year into most of the coun-
ties of England, for the trial (with a jury of the
both civil and criminal. They sit by virtue of
several commissions, each of which, in reality,
constitutes them a separate and distinct court.
The commission of oyer and terminer gives them
authority for- the trial of treasons and felonies;
that of general gaol delivery empowers them to
try every prisoner then in gaol for ,whatever of-
fense; so that, altogether, they possess full crim-
inal jurisdiction.
In American law. This name is generally used
(sometimes, with additions) as the title, or part
of the title, of a state court of criminal jurisdic-
tion, or of the criminal branch of a court of gen-
eral jurisdiction, being commonly applied to such
courts as may try felonies, or the higher grades
of crime. Such courts exist in Delaware and
Pennsylvania. They were abolished in New York
and New Jersey in 1895.
COURT OF OYER AND TERMiNER AND
ERAL GAOL (or JAIL) DELIVERY, In Amer-
ican law. A court of criminal juriftd.iCtiOn in the
state of Pennsylvania. It is held ta the same time

317, note. See Court of the Steward and Mar-
shal.

## COURT OF PASSAGE

An inferior court, pos-
sessing a very ancient jurisdiction over causes
of action arising within the borough of Liverpool.
It appears to have been also called the "Borough.
Court of Liverpool." It has the same jurisdic-
tion in admiralty matters as the Lancashire coun-
ty court. Rosc. Adm. 75.

## COURT OF PECULIARS

A spiritual court in
England, being a branch of, and annexed to, the
Court of Arches. It has a jurisdiction over all
those parishes dispersed through the province of
Canterbury, in the midst of other dioceses, which
are exempt from the ordinary's jurisdiction, and
subject to the metropolitan only. All ecclesiastic-
al causes arising within these peculiar or exempt
jurisdictions are originally cognizable by this
court, from which an appeal lies to the Court of
Arches. 3 Steph. Comm. 431; 4 Reeve, Eng. Law,
104. Most of such courts have been abolished by
legislation. 1 Holdsw. Hist. Eng. Law 352. See,
also, Arches Court.

## COURT OF PIEPOUDRE

(Also spelled Pipow-
der, Pie Powder, Py-Powder, Piedpoudre, etc.)
The lowest (and most expeditious) of the courts
of justice known to the older law of England. It
is supposed (by Cowell and Blount) to have been
so called from the dusty feet of the suitors. For
another conjecture as to the origin of the name,
see Co. 4th Inst. 472. It was a court of record in-
steward, and had jurisdiction to administer jus-
tice for all commercial injuries and minor of-
fenses done in that same fair or market, (not a
preceding one.) Inderwick, King's Peace 105.
An appeal lay to the courts at Westminster. This
court long ago fell into disuse. 3 Bl. Comm. 32;
Barrington, Stat. 337; 3 Steph. Comm. 317, n.;
Skene, de verb. sig. Pede pulverosus; Bracton 334;
22 L.Q.R. 244; 1 Holdsw. Hist. E. L. 309. See,
however, Odgers, C. L. 1021,
COURT OF PLEAS. A court of the county pala-
tine of Durham, having a local common-law juris-
diction. It was abolished by the judicature act,
which transferred its jurisdiction to the high
court. Jud.Act 1873, § 16; 3 Bl.Comm. 79.

## COURT OF POLICIES OF ASSURANCE

A
court established by statute 43 Eliz. c. 12, to de-
termine in a summary way all causes between
merchants, concerning policies of insurance,
Crabb, Eng. Law, 503. The court was formally
abolished by stat. 26 & 27 Vict. c. 125. 3 Bl.Comm,
74; 3 Steph. Comm. 317, n.

## COURT OF PRIVATE LAND CLAIMS

A fed-
eral court created by act of Congress in 1891 (26
Stat. 854), to hear and determine claims by pri-
vate parties to lands within the public domain,
where such claims originated under Spanish or
Mexican grants, and had not already been con-
firmed by Congress or otherwise adjudicated.
The existence and authority of this court were
to cease and determine at the end of the year
COURT OF PROBATE. In English law. The
name of a court established in 1857, under the
probate act of that year, (20 & 21 Viet, c. 77,) to
be held in London, to which court was transfer-
red the testamentary jurisdiction of the ecclesi-
astical courts. 2 Steph. Comm. 192. By the judi-
cature acts, this court is merged in the high court
of justice.
In American law. A court having jurisdic-
tion over the probate of wills, the grant of admin-
istration, and the supervision of the management
and settlement of the estates of decedents, includ-
ing the collection of assets, the allowance of
claims, and the distribution of the estate. In
some states the probate courts also have juris-
diction of the estates of minors, including the ap
pointment of guardians and the settlement of
their accounts, and of the estates of lunatics, habi-
tual drunkards, and spendthrifts. Pons v. Pons,
132 La. 370, 61 So. 406, 407. And in some states
these courts possess a limited jurisdiction in civil,
and criminal cases. They are also called in some
jurisdictions "orphans' courts" and "surrogate's
courts."

## COURT OF PYPOWDER, PY-POWDER, or PY- POWDERS

See Court of Piepoudre.,

## COURT OF QUARTER SESSIONS OF THE PEACE

In American law. A court of criminal
jurisdiction in the state of Pennsylvania, having
tain functions of an administrative nature. There
is one such court in each county of the state. Its
sessions are, in general, held at the same time
and by the same judges as the court of oyer and
terminer and general jail delivery. Const.Pa.
art. 5, § 1; 17 P.S. §§ 331, 361.

## COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH

See Court of
King's Bench.

## COURT OF RECORD

See Court, supra.

## COURT OF REGARD

In English law. One of
the forest courts, in England, held every third
year, for the lawing or expeditation of dogs, to
prevent them from running after deer. It is now
obsolete. 3 Steph. Comm. 440; 3 Bl. Comm. 71,
COURT OF SESSION. The name of the highest
court of civil jurisdiction in Scotland. It was
composed of fifteen judges, now of thirteen. It
sits in two divisions. The lord president and three
ordinary lords form the first division; the lord
justice clerk and three other ordinary lords form
the second division. There are five permanent
lords ordinary attached equally to both divisions;
the last appointed of whom officiates on the bills,
i. e., petitions preferred to the court during the
session, and performs the other duties of junior
lord ordinary. The chambers of the parliament
house in which the first and second divisions hold
their sittings are called the "inner house;" those
in which the lords ordinary sit as single judges to
hear motions and causes are collectively called
the "outer house." The nomination and appoint-
ment of the judges is in the crown. Wharton.

## COURT OF SESSIONS

Courts of criminal ju-
risdiction existing in California, New York, and
one or two other of the United States.

## COURT OF SHEPWAY

A court held before the
lord warden of the Cinque Ports. A writ of er-
ror lay from the mayor and jurats of each port
to the lord warden in this court, and thence to the
queen's bench. The civil jurisdiction of the Cin-
que Ports is abolished by 18 & 19 Vict. c. 48.

## COURT OF SPECIAL SESSIONS

A generic
term, applicable to those courts which have no
stated terms and are not continuous, but which are
organized only for the trial of each particular case
and become functus officio when judgment is ren-
dered therein. People v. Wagner, 45 N.Y.S.2d
314, 316.

## COURT OF STANNARIES

In English law. A
court established in Devonshire and Cornwall, for
the administration of justice among the miners
and tinners, that they might not be drawn away
from their business to attend suits in distant
courts. The stannary court is a court of record,
with a special jurisdiction. 3 Bl. Comm. 79.

## COURT OF STAR CHAMBER

This was an Eng-
lish court of very ancient origin, but new-modeled.
by St. 3 Hen. VII. c. 1, and 21 Hen. VIII. c. 20, con-
sisting of divers lords, spiritual and temporal, be-
ing privy councillors, together with two judges of
the courts of common law, without the interven-
tion of any jury. The jurisdiction extended legal-
ly over riots, perjury, misbehavior of sheriffs, and
other misdemeanors contrary to the laws of the
land; yet it was afterwards stretched to the as-
serting of all proclamations and orders of state,
to the vindicating of illegal commissions and
grants of monopolies; holding for honorable that
which it pleased, and for just that which it pro-
fited, and becoming both a court of law to deter-
mine civil rights and a court of revenue to enrich
the treasury. It was finally abolished by St. 16
Car. I, c. 10, to the general satisfaction of the
whole nation. Brown.

## COURT OF SURVEY

A court for the hearing
of appeals by owners or masters of ships, from
orders for the detention of unsafe ships, made by
the English board of trade, under the merchant
shipping act, 1876, § 6.
COURT OF SWEINMOTE (spelled, also, Swain-
mote, Swain-gemote; Saxon, swang, an attend-
ant, a freeholder, and mote or gemote, a meeting).
One of the old forest courts, held before the ver-
derers, as judges, by the steward, thrice in every
year,—the sweins or freeholders within the forest
composing the jury. This court had jurisdiction
to inquire into grievances and oppressions com-
mitted by the officers of the forest, and also to re-
ceive and try presentments certified from the
court of attachments, certifying the cause, in turn,.
under the seals of the jury, in case of conviction,
to the court of justice seat for the rendition of
judgment. Cowell; 3 Bla. Corn. 71, 72; 3 Steph.
Corn. 317, n. See Inderwick, King's Peace 150;
Forest Laws.
COURT OF THE CHIEF JUSTICE IN EYRE.
The highest of the courts of the forest, held every
three years, by the chief justice, to inquire of pur-
prestures or encroachments, assarts, or cultiva-
tion of forest land, claims to franchises, parks,
warrens, and vineyards in the forest, as well as
claims of the hundred, claims to the goods of fel-
ons found in the forest, and any other civil ques-
tions that might arise within the forest limits.
But it had no criminal jurisdiction, except of of-
fenses against the forest laws. It was called also
the court of justice seat. Inderwick, King's Peace.
Since the Restoration the forest laws have fallen
into disuse. The office was abolished in 1817.
COURT OF THE CLERK OF THE MARKET.
An English court of inferior jurisdiction held in
every fair or market for the punishment of mis-
demeanors committed therein. The jurisdiction
over weights and measures formerly exercised
was taken away by stat. 5 & 6 Will. IV. c. 637
9 M. & W. 747. 4 Steph. Comm. 323.

## COURT OF THE CORONER

In English law. A
court of record, to inquire, when any one dies in
prison, or comes to a violent or sudden death, by
what manner he came to his end. 4 Steph. Comm.
323; 4 Bl. Comm. 274. Now generally known as
an inquest. See Coroner.

## COURT OF THE COUNTIES PALATINE

In
English law. A species of private court which
formerly appertained to the counties palatine of
Lancaster and Durham. 1 Holdsw. Hist. E. L. 47;
1 Steph. Hist. C. L. 138; Coke, 4 Inst. 239; 1
Harg. L. Tr. 378.

## COURT OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER

A.
court of special jurisdiction, held before the chan-
cellor of the duchy or his deputy, concerning all
matters of equity relating to lands holden of the
king in right of the duchy of Lancaster. 3 Bl.
Comm. 78.

## COURT OF THE EARL MARSHAL

In the reign
of William the Conqueror the marshal was next
in rank to the constable, in command of the army.
When the constable's office ceased, his duties de-
volved upon the earl marshal. The military
Court of the Constable came to be known as the
Marshal's Court, or, in its modern form, Court-
Martial. Aside from its criminal jurisdiction, it
had much to do with questions relating to fiefs
and military tenures, though not to property
rights involved therein. Davis, Mil. Laws of U. S.
14. See Hale, Hist. C. L. 36; Grose, Mil. Antiq.
See Court of Chivalry; Courts-Martial; Constable
of England.

## COURT OF THE LORD HIGH ADMIRAL

In
the earlier part of the 14th century, the Admiral
possessed a disciplinary jurisdiction over his fleet.
After 1340 it is reasonable to suppose that the
Admiral could hold an independent court and ad-
minister justice in piracy and other maritime
cases. There were at first several admirals and
several courts. From the early 15th century
there was one Lord High Admiral and one Court
of Admiralty. 1 Holdsw. Hist. E. L. 313.

## COURT OF THE LORD HIGH STEWARD

In
English law. A court instituted for the trial, dur-
ing the recess of parliament, of peers indicted for
treason or felony, or for misprision of either.
This court is not a permanent body, but is creat-
ed in modern times, when occasion requires, and
for the time being, only; and the lord high stew
ard, so constituted, with such of the temporal
lords as may take the proper oath, and act, con-
stitute the court.
All peers who have a right to sit and vote in Parliament
must be summoned. They are the sole judges of fact, and
the majority, which must consist of twelve at least,
decides. The Lord High Steward has a vote, and is judge
of all matters of law.

## COURT OF THE LORD HIGH STEWARD OF THE UNIVERSITIES

In English law. A court
constituted for the trial of scholars or privileged
persons connected with the university at Oxford
or Cambridge who are indicted for treason, felony,
or mayhem. 3 Bla. Comm. 83; 4 id. 277; 1 Steph.
Comm. 67; 3 id. 341; 4 id. 261.

## COURT OF THE OFFICIAL PRINCIPAL

This
court, the Court of the "Official Principal" of the
Archbishop of Canterbury, is more commonly
called the Arches Court, or Court of the Arches.
See Arches Court.
COURT OF THE STEWARD AND MARSHAL.
A high court, formerly held in England by the
steward and marshal of the king's household, hav-
ing jurisdiction of all actions against the king's
peace within the bounds of the household for
twelve miles, which circuit was called the "verge."
Crabb, Eng. Law, 185. It had also jurisdiction
of actions of debt and covenant, where both the
parties were of the household. 2 Reeve, Eng.Law,
235, 247. This court was created by Charles I.,
and abolished in 1849. It was held in the bor-
ough of Southwark, and was called also the "pal-
ace court," having jurisdiction of all personal ac-
tions arising within twelve miles of the royal pal-
ace of Whitehall, exclusive of London.

## COURT OF THE STEWARD OF THE KING'S HOUSEHOLD

In English law. A court which
had jurisdiction of all cases of treason, misprision
of treason, murder, manslaughter, bloodshed, and
other malicious strikings whereby blood is shed,
occurring in or within the limits of any of the pal-
aces or houses of the king, or any other house
where the royal person is abiding. It was created
by statute 33 Hen. VIII, c. 12, but long ago fell
into disuse. 4 Bl. Comm. 276, 277, and notes.

## COURT OF WARDS AND LIVERIES

A court
of record, established in England in the reign of
Henry VIII. For the survey and management of
the valuable fruits of tenure, a court of record was
created by St. 32 Hen. VIII. c. 46, called the "Court
of the King's Wards." To this was annexed, by
St. 33 Hen. VIII, c. 22, the "Court of Liveries;" so
that it then became the "Court of Wards and Liv-
eries." 4 Reeve, Eng. Law, 258. This court was
not only for the management of "wards," prop-
erly so called, but also of idiots and natural fools
in the king's custody, and for licenses to be grant-
ed to the king's widows to marry, and fines to be
made for marrying without his license. Id. 259.
It was abolished by St. 12 Car. II. c. 24. Crabb,
Eng. Law, 468; 4 Reeve, Hist. E. L. 259; Crabb,
Hist. E. L. 468; 1 Steph. Com. 183; 4 id. 40; 2
Bla. Corn. 68; 3 id. 258.

## COURT ROLLS

The rolls of a manor, contain-
ing all acts relating thereto. While belonging to
the lord of the manor, they are not in the nature
of public books for the benefit of the tenant.

## COURTS OF APPEALS

A system of courts of
the United States (one in each circuit) created by
act of congress, composed of three or more judges
(provision being made also for the allotment of
the justices of the supreme court among the cir-
cuits), and having appellate jurisdiction as defin-
ed by statute. 28 U.S.C.A. §§ 41-48, 1291-1294.
Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia was held to
be Circuit Court of Appeals, Swift & Co. v. U. S., App.D.C.,
276 U. S. 311, 48 S.Ct. 311, 313, 72 L. Ed. 587.

## COURTS OF ASSIZE AND NISI PRIUS

Courts
in England composed of two or more commis-
sioners, called "judges of assize," (or of "assize
and nisi prius,") who are twice in every year
sent by the king's special commission, on circuits
all round the kingdom, to try, by a jury of the
respective counties, the truth of such matters of
fact as are there under dispute in the courts of
Westminster Hall. 3 Steph. Comm. 421, 422; 3
Bi. Comm. 57; 2 Odger, Corn. Law, 985.

## COURTS OF CINQUE PORTS

In English law.
Courts of limited local jurisdiction formerly held
before the mayor and jurats (aldermen) of the
Cinque Ports. Their jurisdiction was not affected
by the Judicature Act of 1873. 1 Holdsw. Hist.
E. L. 305; 3 Bla. Comm. 79; 2 Steph. Comm. 499.

## COURTS OF THE FOREST

Courts held for the
enforcement of the forest laws. Inderwick,
King's Peace. See Forest Courts.

## COURTS OF THE FRANCHISES

Jurisdictions
in the early Norman period which rested upon
royal grants—often assumed. Edward I., in 1274,
sent out commissioners to enquire by what war-
rant different landowners were exercising their
Jura regalia. There were many varieties of lesser
franchises. Some of these franchises were recog-
nized as existing by the County Courts Acts, 1846–
1888. 1 Holdsw. Hist. E. L. 61.

## COURTS OF PRINCIPALITY OF WALES

A.
species of private courts of a limited though ex-
tensive jurisdiction, which, upon the thorough
reduction of that principality and the settling of
its polity in the reign of Henry VIII, were erect-
ed all over the country. These courts, however,
have been abolished by 1 Wm. IV. c. 70; the prin-
cipality being now divided into two circuits, which
the judges visit in the same manner as they do
the circuits in England, for the purpose of dis-
posing of those causes which are ready for trial.
Brown.

## COURTS OF REQUEST

Inferior courts, in Eng-
land, having local jurisdiction in claims for small
debts, established in various parts of the kingdom
by special acts of parliament. They were abol-
ished in 1846, and the modern county courts (q.
v.) took their place. 3 Steph. Comm. 283, 449;
1 Holdsw. H. E. L. 208; Bac. Abridg.; Select Cases
in the Court of Requests (Selden Society, Publ.
vol. 12).
COURTS OF THE UNITED STATES comprise
the following: The senate of the United States,
sitting as a court of impeachment; the supreme
court; the courts of appeals; the district courts;
the court of claims; the court of customs and
patent appeals; the customs court; the tax court
of the United States; and provisional courts;
courts of territories and outlying possessions.
COURTS OF THE UNIVERSITIES of Oxford and
Cambridge have jurisdiction in all personal ac-
tions to which any member or servant of the re-
spective university is a party, provided that the
cause of action arose within the liberties of the
university, and that the member or servant was
resident in the university when it arose, and when
the action was brought. 3 Steph.Comm. 299; St.
25 & 26 Vict. c. 26, § 12, St. 19 & 20 Vict. c. 17.
Each university court also has a criminal juris-
diction in all offenses committed by its members.
4 Steph. Comm. 325.

## COURTS OF WESTMINSTER HALL

The su-
perior courts, both of law and equity, were for
centuries fixed at Westminster, an ancient palace
of the monarchs of England. Formerly, all the
superior courts were held before the king's cap-
ital justiciary of England, in the aula regis, or
such of his palaces wherein his royal person re-
sided, and removed with his household from one
end of the kingdom to another. This was found
to occasion great inconvenience to the suitors to
remedy which it was made an article of the great
charter of liberties, both of King John and King
Henry III., that "common pleas should no longer
follow the king's court, but be held in some cer-
tain place," in consequence of which they have
ever since been held (a few necessary removals
in times of the plague excepted) in the palace of
Westminster only. The courts of equity also sit.
at Westminster, nominally, during term time, al-
though, actually, only during the first day of
term, for they generally sit in courts provided
for the purpose in, or in the neighborhood of, Lin-
coln's Inn. Brown.

## COURTESY

See Curtesy.

## COURTYARD

A corrupted form of "curtilage,"
signifying a space of land about a dwelling house,
which not only might be inclosed, but within
which appurtenant buildings and structures might
be erected. In re Lafayette Ave. in City of New
York, 118 Misc.Rep. 161, 193 N.Y.S. 802, 804.

## COUSIN

Kindred in the fourth degree, being the
issue (male or female) of the brother or sister of
one's father or mother. Harris v. Harris, 97 N.
J.Eq. 190, 127 A. 108, 109; In re Hering's Estate,
137 Misc. 867, 244 N.Y.S. 138.
Those who descend from the brother or sister or the
father of the person spoken of are called "paternal cous-
ins ;" "maternal cousins" are those who are descended
from the brothers or sisters of the mother. Cousins-ger-
man are first cousins. Sanderson v. Bayley, 4 Myl. & C. 59.
In . English writs, commissions, and other formal instru-
ments issued by the crown, the word signifies any peer of
the degree of an earl. The appellation is as ancient as the
reign of Henry IV., who, being related or allied to every
earl then in the kingdom, acknowledged that connection in
all his letters and public acts ; from which the use has
descended to his successors, though the reason has long ago
failed. Mozley & Whitley.
First cousins. Cousins-german; the children
of, one's uncle or aunt. Sanderson v. Bayley, 4
Mylne & C. 59.
Second cousins. Persons who are related to
each other by descending from the same great-
grandfather or great-grandmother. The children
of one's first cousins are his second cousins.
These are sometimes called "first cousins once re-
moved." Slade v. Fooks, 9 Sim. 387; Corpora-
tion of Bridgnorth v. Collins, 15 Sim. 541.
Quarter cousin. Properly, a cousin in the fourth
degree; but the term has come to express any
remote degree of relationship, and even to bear
an ironical signification in which it denotes a
very trifling degree of intimacy and regard.
Often corrupted into "cater" cousin.

## COUSINAGE

See Cosinage.

## COUSTOM

(Fr. Coutum.) Custom; duty; toll;
tribute. 1 Bl. Comm. 314.

## COUSTOUMIER

(Otherwise spelled "Coustu-
mier" or "Coutumier.") In old French law. A
collection of customs, unwritten laws, and forms
of procedure. Two such volumes are of especial
importance in juridical history, viz., the Grand
Coustumier de Normandie, and the Coutumier de
France or Grand Coutumier.

## COUTHUTLAUGH

A person who willingly and
knowingly received an outlaw, and cherished or
concealed him; for which offense he underwent
the same punishment as the outlaw himself.
Bract. 128b ; Spelman.

## COUVERTURE

In French law. The deposit
("margin") made by the client in the hands of the
broker, either of a sum of money or of securities,
in order to guaranty the broker for the payment of
the securities which he purchases for the client.
Arg.Fr.Merc.Law, 555.

## COVENABLE

A French word signifying con-
venient or suitable; as covenably endowed. An-
ciently written "convenable." Termes de la Ley.
COVENANT.
Practice
The name of a common-law form of action ex
contractu, which lies for the recovery of damages
for breach of a covenant, or contract under seal.
Stickney v. Stickney, 21 N.H. 68; Utilities Produc-
tion Corporation v. Southwestern Natural Gas Co.,
Del., 1 Terry 401, 11 A.2d 275, 276.
Law of Contracts
An agreement, convention, or promise of two or
more parties, by deed in writing, signed, sealed,
and delivered, by which either of the parties
pledges himself to the other that something is
either done or shall be done, or stipulates for the
truth of certain facts. Commonwealth v. Robin.
son, 1 Watts, Pa., 160; Kent v. Edmondston, 49
N.C. 529; Schram v. Coyne, C.C.A.Mich., 127 F.2d
205, 209; Sabin v. Hamilton, 2 Ark. 485, 490 (see,
however, the later case of Dyer v. Gill, 32 Ark.
410, pointing out that by virtue of statute in Ar-
kansas, the distinction between sealed and un-
sealed instruments, with reference to contracts
between individuals, has been abolished).
An agreement between two or more parties, reduced to
writing and executed by a sealing and delivery thereof,
whereby some of the parties named therein engage, or
one of them engages, with the other, or others, or some of
them, therein also named, that some act hath or hath not
already been done, or for the performance or non-perform-
ance of some specified duty. De Bolle v. Insurance Co., 4
Whart., Pa., 71, 33 Am.Dec. 38.
In common parlance, any agreement, whether
under seal or not. 15 C.J. 1209; 7 R.C.L. 1084;
Jenkins v. John Taylor Dry Goods Co., 352 Mo.
660, 179 S.W.2d 54, 58.
In effect, this has become the legal meaning in many
states, in which private seals have been abolished by stat-
ute. For a number of these state statutes, see 66 L.R.A.
686, 687. In those states it is commonly held that the affix-
ing of a seal, when unnecessary to the validity of the
instrument, has no effect, and may be disregarded. 24
R.C.L. 689. "Seals are a relic of that period when men, as
a rule, could not write," and a covenant may "be created
in this state [Georgia] by a writing not under seal."
Atlanta, K. & N. Ry. Co. v. McKinney, 124 Ga. 929, 53 S.E.
701, 703, 6 L.R.A.,N.S., 436.
Classification
Covenants may be classified according to several
distinct principles of division. According as one or
other of these is adopted, they are:
Express or implied. The former being those
which are created by the express words of the
parties to the deed declaratory of their intention,
while implied covenants are those which are in-
ferred by the law from certain words in a deed
which imply (though they do not express) them.
Express covenants are also called covenants "in
deed," as distinguished from covenants "in law."
McDonough v. Martin, 88 Ga. 675, 16 S.E. 59, 18 L.
R.A. 343; Garstang v. Davenport, 90 Iowa 359, 57
N.W. 876.
Dependent, concurrent, and independent. Cove-
nants are either dependent, concurrent, or mutual
and independent. The first depends on the prior
performance of some act or condition, and, until
the condition is performed, the other party is
not liable to an action on his covenant. In the
second, mutual acts are to be performed at the
same time; and if one party is ready, and offers
to perform his part, and the other neglects or
refuses to perform his, he who is ready and offers
has fulfilled his engagement, and may maintain
an action for the default of the other, though it
is not certain that either is obliged to do the first
act. The third sort is where either party may re-
cover damages from the other for the injuries
he may have received by a breach of the cove-
nants in his favor; and it is no excuse for the
defendant to allege a breach of the covenants on
the part of the plaintiff. Bailey v. White, 3 Ala.
330; Gray v. Smith, C.C.Cal., 76 F. 534; Lowery v.
May, 213 Ala. 66, 104 So. 5, 8; Roberts v. Steel-
man, C.C.A.N.J., 1 F.2d 180, 182..
Mutual and independent covenants are such as do not go
to the whole consideration on both sides, but only to a
part, and where separate actions lie for breaches on either
side to recover damages for the injury sustained by breach.
Lowery v. May, 213 Ala. 66, 104 So. 5, 8; Big Run Coal Co.
v. Employers' Indemnity Co., 163 Ky. 596, 174 S.W. 25, 26.
Covenants are dependent where performance by one par-
ty is conditioned on and subject to performance by the
other, and in such case the party who seeks performance
must show performance or a tender or readiness to per-
form on his part; but covenants are independent when
actual performance of one is not dependent on another, and
where, in consequence, the remedy of both sides is by
action. Roberts v. Steelman, C.C.A.N.J., 1 F.2d 180, 182.
Principal and auxiliary. The former being those
which relate directly to the principal matter of the
contract entered into between the parties; while
auxiliary covenants are those which do not re-
late directly to the principal matter of contract
between the parties, but to something connected
with it.
Inherent and collateral. The former being suc
as immediately affect the particular propert
while the latter affect some property collatera
thereto or some matter collateral to the grant o
lease. Shep.Touch. 161.
A covenant inherent is one which is conversant about th
land, and knit to the estate in the land; as, that the thin
demised shall be quietly enjoyed, shall be kept in repair
or shall not be aliened. A covenant collateral is one whic
is conversant about some collateral thing that doth noth
ing at all, or not so immediately, concern the thing grant
ed; as to pay a sum of money in gross, etc.
Joint or several. The former bind both or al
the covenantors together; the latter bind each o
them separately. A covenant may be both join
and several at the same time, as regards the cove
nantors; but, as regards the covenantees, the
cannot be joint and several for one and the sam
cause, (5 Coke, 19a,) but must be either joint o
several only. Brown. See Capen v. Barrows,
Gray, Mass., 379; In re Slingsby, 5 Coke, 18b.
Covenants are usually joint or several according as th
interests of the covenantees are such; but the words of th
covenant, where they are unambiguous, will decide
although, where they are ambiguous the nature of t
interests as being joint or several is left to decide.
General or specific. The former relate to lan
generally and place the covenantee in the positio
of a specialty creditor only; the latter relate t
particular lands and give the covenantee a lie
thereon. Brown.
Executed or executory. The former being suc
as relate to an act already performed; while th
latter are those whose performance is to be f
ture. Shep.Touch. 161.
Affirmative or negative. The former bein
those in which the party binds himself to the e
istence of a present state of facts as represente
or to the future performance of some act; whil
the latter are those in which the covenanto
obliges himself not to do or perform some act.
Declaratory or obligatory. The former bei
those which serve to limit or direct uses; whil
the latter are those which are binding on the part
himself. 1 Sid. 27; 1 Keb. 337.
Real and personal. A real covenant is one whic
binds the heirs of the covenantor and passes t
assignees or purchasers; a covenant the oblig
tion of which is so connected with the realty th
he who has the latter is either entitled to the ben
fit of it or is liable to perform it; a covena
which has for its object something annexed t
or inherent in, or connected with, land or othe
real property, and runs with the land, so th
the grantee of the land is invested with it an
may sue upon it for a breach happening in h
time. 4 Kent, Comm. 470; 2 Bl.Comm. 304; Cha
man v. Holmes, 10 N.J.Law, 20; Skinner v. Mitc
ell, 5 Kan.App. 366, 48 P. 450; Oil Co. v. Hinto
159 Ind. 398, 64 N.E. 224; Davis v. Lyman, 6 Con
In the old books, a covenant real is also defined to
a covenant by which a man binds himself to pass a thi
real, as lands or tenements. Termes de la Ley; 3 B
Comm. 156; Shep.Touch. 161. A personal covenant, on th
•
real estate of the covenantor, only binds himself and his
,
personal representatives in respect to assets. 4 Kent,
Comm. 470; Carter v. Denman, 23 N.J.Law, 270; Hadley
v. Bernero, 97 Mo.App. 314, 71 S.W. 451. The phrase may
also mean a covenant which is personal to the covenantor,
that is, one which he must perform in person, and cannot
procure another person to perform for him. De Sanno v.
Earle, 273 Pa. 265, 117 A. 200, 202; Pearson v. Richards,
106 Or. 78, 211 P. 167, 171. "Real covenants" relate to
realty and have for their main object some benefit thereto,
inuring to benefit of and becoming binding on subsequent
grantees, while "personal covenants" do not run with land.
Bank of Hoxie v. Meriwether, 166 Ark. 39, 265 S.W. 642,
645. Very considerable confusion exists among the author-
ities in the use of the term real covenants. The definition
of Blackstone which determines the character of covenants
from the insertion or noninsertion of the word "heir" by
the covenantor, is pretty generally rejected.
Transitive or intransitive. The former being
those personal covenants the duty of performing
which passes over to the representatives of the
covenantor; while the latter are those the duty
of performing which is limited to the covenantee
himself, and does not pass over to his representa-
tive. Bac.Abr.Cov.
e Disjunctive covenants. Those which are for the
performance of one or more of several things at
the election of the covenantor or covenantee, as
the case may be. Platt, Coy. 21.
Absolute or conditional. An absolute covenant
is one which is not qualified or limited by any con-
dition.
Other Compound and Descriptive Terms
- Continuing covenant. One which indicates or
necessarily implies the doing of stipulated acts
successively or as often as the occasion may re-
quire; as, a covenant to pay rent by installments,
-
to keep the premises in repair or insured, to culti-
vate land, etc. McGlynn v. Moore, 25 Cal. 395.
Full covenants. As this term is used in Ameri-
can law, it includes the following: The covenants
for seisin, for right to convey, against incum-
g
brances, for quiet enjoyment, sometimes for fur-
ther assurance, and almost always of warranty,
this last often taking the place of the covenant for
quiet enjoyment, and indeed in many states being
the only covenant in practical use. Rawle, Coy.
for Title, § 21.
-
Mutual covenants. A mutual covenant is one
t
where either party may recover damages from the
-
other for the injury he may have received from a
t
breach of the covenants in his favor. Bailey v.
,
White, 3 Ala. 330.
t
Separate covenant. A several covenant; one
which binds the several covenantors each for him-
s
self, but not jointly.

-
Usual covenants. An agreement on the part of
,
a seller of real property to give the usual cove-
.
nants binds him to insert in the grant covenants of
"seisin," "quiet enjoyment," "further assurance,"
e "general warranty," and "against incumbrances."
g
Wilson v. Wood, 17 N.J.Eq. 216, 88 Am.Dec. 231;
.
Drake v. Barton, 18 Minn. 467, Gil. 414.
where the agreement is silent as to the particular cove-
nants to be inserted in the lease, and provides merely for
the lease containing "usual covenants," or, which is the
same thing, in an open agreement without any reference
to the covenants, and there are no special circumstances
justifying the introduction of other covenants, the follow-
ing are the only ones which either party can insist upon,
namely; Covenants by the lessee (1) to pay rent; (2)
to pay taxes, except such as are expressly payable by the
landlord; (3) to keep and deliver up the premises in
repair; and (4) to allow the lessor to enter and view the
state of repair; and the usual qualified covenant by the
lessor for quiet enjoyment by the lessee. 7 Ch.Div. 561.
Specific Covenants
Covenants against incumbrances. A covenant
that there are no incumbrances on the land con-
veyed; a stipulation against all rights to or in-
terests in the land which may subsist in third
persons to the diminution of the value of the es-
tate granted. Bank v. Parisette, 68 Ohio St. 450,
67 N.E. 896; Shearer v. Ranger, 22 Pick., Mass:,
447; Matzger v. Arcade Building & Realty Co.,
102 Wash. 423, 173 P. 47.
Covenant for further assurance. An undertak-
ing, in the form of a covenant, on the part of the
vendor of real estate to do such further acts for
the purpose of perfecting the purchaser's title
as the latter may reasonably require. This cove-
nant is deemed of great importance, since it re-
lates both to the vendor's title of and to the in-
strument of conveyance to the vendee, and op-
erates as well to secure the performance of all
acts necessary for supplying any defect in the
former as to remove all objections to the sufficien-
cy and security of the latter. Platt, Cov.; Rawle,
Coy. §§ 98, 99. See Sugd.Vend. 500; Armstrong v.
Darby, 26 Mo. 520.
Covenant for quiet enjoyment. An assurance
against the consequences of a defective title, and
of any disturbances thereupon. Platt, Cov. 312;

tor, and binding him for the completeness, se-
curity, and continuance of the title transferred to
the grantee. They comprise "covenants for seisin,
for right to convey, against incumbrances, or quiet
enjoyment, sometimes for further assurance, and
almost always of warranty." Rawle, Cov. § 21.
Covenants in gross. Such as do not run with
the land.
Covenant not to sue. A covenant by one who
had a right of action at the time of making it
against another person, by which he agrees not to
sue to enforce such right of action. Pacific States
Lumber Co. v. Bargar, C.C.A.Or., 10 F.2d 335, 337;
McDonald v. Goddard Grocery Co., 184 Mo.App.
432, 171 S.W. 650, 651,
employed, particularly in the New England states,
and in deeds of extinguishment of ground rents in
Pennsylvania, that neither the vendor, nor his
heirs, nor any other person, etc., shall claim any
title in the premises conveyed. Rawle, Coy. § 22.

capacity and title to convey the estate which he
by his deed undertakes to convey.
Covenant of seisin. An assurance to the pur-
chaser that the grantor has the very estate in
quantity and quality which he purports to con-
vey. 11 East, 641; Rawle, Coy. § 58; Burton v.
Price, 105 Fla. 544, 141 So. 728, 729.
It is said that the covenant of seisin is not now in use
in England, being embraced in that of a right to convey;
but it is used in several of the United States. 2 Washb.
Heal Prop. *648.
Covenant of warranty. An assurance by the
grantor of an estate that the grantee shall enjoy
the same without interruption by virtue of para-
mount title. King v. Kilbride, 58 Conn. 109, 19
A. 519; Blair v. Morris, 212 Ala. 91, 101 So. 745,
746; Biwer v. Martin, 294 Ill. 488, 128 N.E. 518,
Covenant running with land. A covenant which
goes with the land, as being annexed to the es-
tate, and which cannot be separated from the
land, and transferred without it. 4 Kent, Comm.
472, note.
A covenant is said to run with the land, when not only
the original parties or their representatives, but each suc-
cessive owner of the land, will be entitled to its benefit, or
be liable (as the case may be) to its obligation. 1 Steph.
Comm. 455. Or, in other words, it is so called when either
the liability to perform it or the right to take advantage
cf it passes to the assignee of the land. Tillotson v.
Prichard, 60 Vt. 94, 14 A. 302, 6 Am.St.Rep. 95; Spencer's
Case, 3 Coke, 31. One which touches and concerns the
land itself, so that its benefit or obligation passes with
the ownership. Local Federal Savings Loan Ass'n of
Oklahoma City v. Eckroat, 186 Okl. 660, 100 P.2d 261, 262.
Covenant running with title. A covenant which
goes with the title. Stipulation in a lease granting

Covenant to convey. A covenant by which the
convenantor agrees to convey to the covenantee a
certain estate, under certain circumstances.
Covenant to renew. An executory contract,

with the terms specified in the renewal clause,
if any, or, if none, on giving notice, prior to termi-
nation of the lease, of his desire to renew, where-
upon the contract becomes executed as to him.
Freiheit v. Broch, 98 Conn. 166, 118 A. 828, 830.
Covenant to stand seised. A conveyance adapted
to the case where a person seised of land in pos-
session, reversion, or vested remainder, proposes
to convey it to his wife, child, or kinsman. In its
terms it consists of a covenant by him, in consid-
seised of the land to the use of the intended trans-
feree. Before the statute of uses this would mere-
ly have raised a use in favor of the convenantee;
but by that act this use is converted into the legal
estate, and the covenant therefore operates as a
conveyance of the land to the covenantee. It is
now almost obsolete. 1 Steph.Comm. 532; Wil-
liams, Seis. 145; French v. French, 3 N.H. 261;
Jackson v. Swart, 20 Johns., N.Y., 85.

## COVENANTS PERFORMED

In Pennsylvania
practice. This is the name of a plea to the action
of covenant whereby the defendant, upon informal
notice to the plaintiff, may give anything in evi-
dence which he might have pleaded. With the
addition of the words "absque hoc" it amounts to
a denial of the allegations of the declaration; and
the further addition of "with leave," etc., imports
an equitable defense, arising out of special cir-
cumstances, which the defendant means to offer in
evidence. Zents v. Legnard, 70 Pa. 192; Stewart
v. Bedell, 79 Pa. 336.

it will do that voluntarily which it cannot be compelled

Strictly, it is a bill by which a creditor seeks to satisfy
his debt out of some equitable estate of the defendant,
which is not liable to levy and sale under an execution at
law. But there is another sort of a creditors' bill, very
nearly allied to the former, by means of which a party
seeks to remove a fraudulent conveyance out of the way of
his execution. But a naked bill to set aside a fraudulent
deed, which seeks no discovery of any property, chose in
action, or other thing alleged to belong to the defendant,
and which ought to be subjected to the payment of the
judgment, is not a creditors' bill. Newman v. Willetts, 52
Ill. 98; Yates v. Council, 137 Miss. 381, 102 So. 176, 177.

ery of property with directions to turn it into
money on the other. 8 Taunt. 499; 2 Smith, Lead.

ing to such debt, as a means of discharging it.
King v. King, 9 N.J.Eq. 44. Credits given by two
persons mutually; i. e., each giving credit to the
other. It is a more extensive phrase than "mu-
tual debts." Thus, the sum credited by one may
be due at once, that by the other payable in fu-

The term in its general and comprehensive sense, is syn-
onymous with "adultery" ; but in its more limited and
technical signification it may be defined as adultery in the
aspect of a tort. Turner v. Heavrin, 182 Ky. 65, 206 S.W.
23, 4 A.L.R. 562.

## CRIME

A positive or negative act in violation
of penal law; an offense against the State. Wil-
kins v. U. S., C.C.A.Pa., 96 F. 837, 37 C.C.A. 588;
are synonymous terms; though in common usage
"crime" is made to denote such offenses as are of
a deeper and more atrocious dye. 4 Bl.Comm. 5;
People v. Schiaffino, 73. Cal.App. 357, 238 P. 725;
Guetling v. State, 199 Ind. 630, 158 N.E. 593, 594;
McIntyre v. Commonwealth, 154 Ky. 149, 156 S.
W. 1058, 1059; Commonwealth v. Smith, 266 Pa.
511, 109 A. 786, 788, 9 A.L.R. 922; Ex parte Brady,
116 Ohio St. 512, 157 N.E. 69, 70; An act com-
mitted or omitted in violation of a public law.
City of Mobile v. McCown Oil Co., 226 Ala. 688,
148 So. 402, 405. Crimes are those wrongs which
the government notices as injurious to the pub-
lic, and punishes in what is called a "criminal
proceeding," in its own name. 1 Bish.Crim.Law,
§ 43; In re Jacoby, 74 Ohio App. 147, 57 N.E.2d
932, 934, 935. A crime may be defined to be any
act • done in violation of those duties which an
individual owes to the community, and for the
breach of which the law has provided that the
offender shall make satisfaction to the public.
Bell. A crime or public offense is an act com-
mitted or omitted in violation of a law forbidding
or commanding it, and to which is annexed, upon
conviction, either of the following punishments:
(1) Death; (2) imprisonment; (3) fine; (4) re-
moval from office; or (5) disqualification to hold
and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit in
this state. Pen.Code Cal. § 15. "Crime" is strict-
ly a violation of law either human or divine; in
present usage the term is commonly applied to
grave offenses against the laws of the state. Van
Riper v. Constitutional Government League, 1
Wash.2d 635, 96 P.2d 588, 591, 125 A.L.R. 1100.
A crime or misdemeanor shall consist in a viola-
tion of a public law, in the commission of which
there shall be a union or joint operation of act
and intention, or criminal negligence. Code Ga.
1882, § 4292, Pen.Code 1910, § 31.
Synonyms
According to Blackstone, the word "crime" de-
notes such offenses as are of a deeper and more
atrocious dye, while smaller faults and omissions
of less consequence are called "misdemeanors."
But the better use appears to be to make crime
a term of broad and general import, including
both felonies and misdemeanors, and hence cov-
ering all infractions of the criminal law. In this
sense it is not a technical phrase, strictly speak-
ing, (as "felony" and "misdemeanor" are,) but a
convenient general term. In this sense, also, "of-
fense" or "public offense" should be used as syn-
onymous with it.
The distinction between a crime and a tort or
civil injury is that the former is a breach and
violation of the public right and of duties due to
the whole community considered as such, and
in its social and aggregate capacity; whereas the
latter is an infringement or privation of the civil
rights of individuals merely. Brown.
A crime, as opposed to a civil injury, is the
violation of a right, considered in reference to the
evil tendency of such violation, as regards the
community at large. 4 Steph.Comm. 4.
Capital crime. See Capital, adj.
Common law crimes
Such crimes as are punishable by the force of
the common law, as distinguished from crimes
created by statute. Wilkins v. U. S., C.C.A.Pa.,
96 F. 837, 37 C.C.A. 588; In re Greene, C.C.Ohio, 52
F. 111. These decisions (and many others) hold
that there are no common-law crimes against
the United States.
Constructive crime
See Constructive Crime.
Continuous crime
One consisting of a continuous series of acts,
which endures after the period of consummation,
as, the offense of carrying concealed weapons. In
the case of instantaneous crimes, the statute of
limitations begins to run with the consummation,
while in the case of continuous crimes it only
begins with the cessation of the criminal conduct
or act. U. S. v. Owen, D.C.Or., 32 F. 537.
Crime against nature
The offense of buggery or sodomy. State v.
Vicknair, 52 La.Ann. 1921, 28 So. 273; Ausman v.
Veal, 10 Ind. 355, 71 Am.Dec. 331. The strict com-
mon-law meaning has been greatly enlarged by
statute. Borden v. State, 3G Okl.Cr. 69, 252 P.
446, 447; State v. Murry, 136 La. 253, 66 So. 963,
964; State v. Long, 133 La. 580, 63 So. 180; Fraz-
ier v. Grob, 194 Mo.App. 405, 183 S.W. 1083, 1084;
State v. Griffin, 175 N.C. 767, 94 S.E. 678, 679. See
Bestiality; Sodomy.
At common law the term "crime against nature"
embraced both sodomy and "bestiality", defined as a con-
nection between a human being and a brute of the opposite
sex. State v. Poole, 59 Ariz. 44, 122 P.2d 415, 416. Within
the statute it is the perverted act of uniting the mouth of
one participant with the sexual organ of the other, with a
view of gratifying the sexual desire, and a mere kiss or
lick of the private organ, even though lewdly done, is not
a "copulation" within the statute. People v. Angier, 44
Cal.App.2d 417, 112 P.2d 659, 660.
Crime against the other (husband or wife)
As used in 22 Okl.St.Ann. 702, providing that
neither husband nor wife shall be a witness
against the other except in a prosecution for a
"crime committed against the other," the phrase
denotes a public offense by husband or wife that
is a direct violation of the rights of the other.
Hunter v. State, 10 Okl.Cr. 119, 134 P. 1134, 1136,
L.R.A. 1915A, 564. It does not make the wife a
competent witness in a prosecution against the
husband for incest. Lacey v. State, 27 Okl.Cr. 42,
224 P. 994, 995.
Murder by wife of husband's child, O'Loughlin v. Peo-
ple, 90 Colo. 368, 10 P.2d 543, 546. Rape against stepdaugh-
ter. State v. Goff, 64 S.D. 80, 264 N.W. 665, 666.
Crimes mala in se
"Crimes mala in se" embrace acts immoral or
wrong in themselves, such as burglary, larceny,
man v. State ex rel. Carver, 119 Fla. 653, 161 So.
89, 90.
Crimes mala prohibita
"Crimes mala prohibita" embrace things pro-
hibited by statute as infringing on others' rights,
though no moral turpitude may attach, and con-
stituting crimes only because they are so prohib-
ited. Coleman v. State ex rel. Carver, 119 Fla.
653, 161 So. 89, 90.
High crimes
High crimes and misdemeanors are such im-
moral and unlawful acts as are nearly allied and
equal in guilt to felony, yet, owing to some tech-
nical circumstance, do not fall within the defini-
tion of "felony." State v. Knapp, 6 Conn. 417, 16
Am.Dec. 68. They are the more serious or ag-
gravated misdemeanors; those more nearly allied
and equal in guilt to felony, but which do not fall
within its definition. Firmara v. Gardner, 86
Conn. 434, 85 A. 670, 672.
Infamous crime
A crime which entails infamy upon one who
has committed it. Butler v. Wentworth, 84 Me.
25, 24 A. 456, 17 L.R.A. 764. The term "infamous"
e., without fame or good report—was applied
at common law to certain crimes, upon the con-
viction of which a person became incompetent to
testify as a witness, upon the theory that a per-
son would not commit so heinous a crime unless
he was so depraved as to be unworthy of credit.
These crimes are treason, felony, and the crimen
_Nisi. Abbott. A crime punishable by imprison-
ment in the state prison or penitentiary, with or
without hard labor, is an infamous crime, within
the provision of the fifth amendment of the con-
stitution that "no person shall be held to answer
for a capital or otherwise infamous crime unless
on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury."
Mackin v. U. S., 117 U.S. 348, 6 S.Ct. 777, 29 L.
Ed. 909; Brede v. Powers, 263 U.S. 4, 44 S.Ct. 8,
68 L.Ed. 132. It is not the character of the crime
but the nature of the punishment which renders
the crime "infamous." Weeks v. United States,
C.C.A.N.Y., 216 F. 292, 298, L.R.A. 1915B, 651. But
see Drazen v. New Haven Taxicab Co., 95 Conn.
500, 111 A. 861, 864. Whether an offense is in-
famous depends on the punishment which may be
imposed therefor, not on the punishment which
was imposed. United States v. Moreland, 258 U.S.
433, 42 S.Ct. 368, 370, 66 L.Ed. 700; De Jianne v.
U. S., C.C.A.N.J., 282 F. 737, 740; Le Clair v. White,
117 Me. 335, 104 A. 516, 517. Under the constitu-
tion of Rhode Island, a crime, to be "infamous,"
must come within the "crimen falsi," such as forg-
ery, perjury, subornation of perjury, offenses af-
fecting the public administration of justice, or
such as would affect civil or political rights, dis-
qualifying or rendering a person incompetent to
be a witness or juror. State v. Bussay, 38 R.I.
454, 96 A. 337, 339. By the Revised Statutes of
New York the term "infamous crime," when used
in any statute, is directed to be construed as in-
cluding every offense punishable with death or
by imprisonment in a state prison, and no other.
Quasi crimes
This term embraces all offenses not crimes or
misdemeanors, but that are in the nature of
crimes,—a class of offenses against the public
which have not been declared crimes, but wrongs
against the general or local public which it is
proper should be repressed or punished by for-
feitures and penalties. This would embrace all
qui tarn actions and forfeitures imposed for the
neglect or violation of a public duty. A quasi
crime would not embrace an indictable offense,
whatever might be its grade, but simply forfeit-
ures for a wrong done to the public, whether vol-
untary or involuntary, where a penalty is given,
whether recoverable by criminal or civil process.
Wiggins v. Chicago, 68 Ill. 375. Also, offenses for
which some person other than the actual per-
petrator is responsible, the perpetrator being pre-
sumed to act by command of the responsible par-
ty. Sometimes, injuries which have been unin-
tentionally caused. Torts. McCaleb v. Fox Film
Corporation, C.C.A.La., 299 F. 48, 50.

nation of a class of offenses, including all such

and measures, counterfeiting seals, and other fraudulent
and deceitful practices. Dig. 48, 10; Hallifax, Civil Law,
b. 3, c. 12, nn. 56-59.
In Scotch law. It has been defined: "A fraudulent imi-
tation or suppression of truth, to the prejudice of
another." Ersk.Inst. 4, 4, 66.

N.W. 215, 216. Such products of the soil as, are

labor, as cereals, vegetables, grass maturing for
harvest or harvested, etc., but not grass on lands
Co., 76 W.Va. 649, 86 S.E. 564, 567. In its more
general signification, means all products of the
soil that are grown and raised annually and gath-
ered during a single season. In this sense the
term includes fructus industriales and fructus na-
turales. The word is also used, however, in a
more restricted sense, as synonymous with fruc-
tus industriales or emblements. Etymology of
word "crop" appears to be from the Saxon "crop"
or "cropp," which signified a cluster of ears of
corn or grapes; another derivation is from the
Welch "cropiad," which meant a fathering or tak-
ing hold of. It is from this derivation that the
word has been held to mean only products after
they have been severed from the soil. At times
a distinction has been drawn between fructus in-
dustriales and fructus naturales. Kennedy v.
Spalding, 143 Kan. 76, 53 P.2d 804, 806; Miethke
v. Pierce County, 173 Wash. 381, 23 P.2d 405; Wed-

Denning, 128 Okl. 145, 261 P. 929, 930.
The difference between a tenant and a cropper
is: A tenant has an estate in the land for the
term, and, consequently, he has a right of prop-
erty in the crops. Until division, the right of
property and of possession in the whole is the
tenant's. A cropper has no estate in the land;
and, although he has in some sense the possession
of the crop, it is the possession of a servant only,
and is, in law, that of the landlord, who must
divide off to the cropper his share. Harrison v.
Ricks, 71 N.C. 7; O'Brien v. Webb, D.C.Cal., 279
F. 117, 120; Cook-Reynolds Co. v. Wilson, 67

fixion; St. Anthony's cross, which is made in the
form of a T; and the Greek cross, +, which is
made by the intersection at right angles of lines
at their center point. Hunt v. Campbell, 19 Ariz.
254, 169 P. 596, 610.
As an adjective, the word is applied to various
demands and proceedings which are connected in
subject-matter, but opposite or contradictory in
purpose or object.

side to the other, as to cross a stream. People
As to cross "Appeal," "Bill," "Complaint," "Re-
mainder," "Rules," see those titles.

ing out of the same transaction which is there
in controversy, whether it be a contract or tort.

some affirmative relief concerning matters in is-
sue, to obtain full relief for all parties and a com-
plete determination of all controversies arising out
of matters alleged in original petition, and to have
affirmative relief against either plaintiff or code-
fendant in the nature of an original petition. Farr
v. Detroit Trust Co., C.C.A.Mich., 116 F.2d 807,
CROSS-DEMAND. Where a person against
whom a demand is made by another, in his turn
makes a demand against that other, these mutual
demands are called "cross-demands." A set-off is
a familiar example. Musselman v. Galligher, 32
Iowa, 383.

## CROSS-ERRORS

Errors being assigned by the
respondent in a writ of error, the errors assigned
on both sides are called "cross-errors."

broader sense, the term includes embankments
constructed as necessary approaches to a railroad
track, St. Louis, I. M. & S. Ry. Co. v. Smith, 118

tion of the court of criminal appeal.

times so termed, the crown being always the prose-

of king's bench. The king's attorney in this court
is called "master of the crown office." 4 Bl.Comm.

licitor for the crown in preparing the prosecution.
In Ireland there are officers called "crown solici-
tors" attached to each circuit, whose duty it is to
get up every case for the crown in criminal prose-
cutions. They are paid by salaries. There is no
such system in England, where prosecutions are
conducted by solicitors appointed by the parish,
or other persons bound over to prosecute by the
magistrates on each committal; but in Scotland
the still better plan exists of a crown prosecutor
(called the "procurator-fiscal," and being a subor-
dinate of the lord-advocate) in every county, who
prepares every criminal prosecution. Wharton.

The intentional and malicious inflic-

and barbarous treatment," or "cruel and inhuman
treatment," as to the meaning of which, and of
"cruelty" in this sense, see Rudnick v. Rudnick,
288 Mass. 256, 192 N.E. 501; Martin v. Martin, 154
Pa.Super. 313, 35 A.2d 546, 548; Price v. Price, 181

A.L.R. 488.
For "Extreme and Repeated Cruelty," see that
title.
As between husband and wife. Those acts which affect
the life, the health, or even the comfort, of the party
aggrieved and give a reasonable apprehension of bodily
hurt, are called "cruelty." What merely wounds the feel-
ings Is seldom admitted to be cruelty, unless the act be
accompanied with bodily injury, either actual or menaced.
Mere austerity of temper, petulance of manners, rudeness
of language, a want of civil attention and accommodation,
even occasional sallies of passion, will not amount to legal
cruelty; a fortiori, the denial of little indulgences and par-
ticular accommodations, which the delicacy of the world
is apt to number among its necessaries, is not cruelty. The
negative descriptions of cruelty are perhaps the best, under
the infinite variety of cases that may occur, by showing
what is not cruelty. Evans v. Evans, 1 Hagg.Const. 35;
Westmeath v. Westmeath, 4 Eng.Ecc. 238, 311, 312.
Cruelty includes both willfulness and malicious temper
of mind with which an act is done, as well as a high degree
of pain inflicted. Acts merely accidental, though they
inflict great pain, are not "cruel," in the sense of the word
as used in statutes against cruelty. Comm. v. McClellan,
101 Mass. 34.
Cruelty to Animals
The infliction of physical pain, suffering, or
death upon an animal, when not necessary for
purposes of training or discipline or (in the case
of death) to procure food or to release the animal
from incurable suffering, but done wantonly, for
mere sport, for the indulgence of a cruel and vin-
dictive temper, or with reckless indifference to its
pain. State v. Porter, 112 N.C. 887, 16 S.E. 915;
State v. Bosworth, 54 Conn. 1, 4 A. 248; McKinne
v. State, 81 Ga. 164, 9 S.E. 1091; Waters v. People,
23 Colo. 33, 46 P. 112, 33 L.R.A. 836,

## CRUISE

A voyage undertaken for a given pur-
pose; a voyage for the purpose of making cap-
tures jure belli. The Brutus, 2 Gall. 538, Fed.
Cas.No.2,060.
A voyage or expedition in quest of vessels or
fleets of the enemy which may be expected to sail
in any particular track at a certain season of the
year. The region in which these cruises are per-
formed is usually termed the "rendezvous," or

CUCKING–STOOL. An engine of correction for
common scolds, which in the Saxon language is
said to signify the scolding-stool, though now it
is frequently corrupted into ducking-stool, because
the judgment was that, when the woman was
placed therein, she should be plunged in the water
for her punishment. It was also variously called
a "trebucket," "tumbrel," or "castigatory." 3 Inst.
219; 4 Bl.Comm. 169; Brown. James v. Comm.,
12 Serg. & R., Pa., 220.

## CUCKOLD

A man whose wife is unfaithful;
the husband of an adulteress. It is explained that
the word alludes to the habit of the female cuck-
old, which lays her eggs in the nests of other

whom her husband had in his lifetime aliened her
lands. Fitzh.N.B. 193. It was a method of estab-
lishing the fact of death, being a trial with wit-
nesses, but without a jury. The object of the writ
was to avoid a judgment obtained against the hus-
band by confession or default. It is obsolete in
England by force of 32 Hen. VIII, c. 28, § 6. See
6 Co. 8, 9. As to its use in Pennsylvania, see 3

## CULAGIUM

In old records. The laying up a
ship in a dock, in order to be repaired. Cowell;
Blount.

## CULPA

Lat. A term of the civil law, meaning
fault, neglect, or negligence. There are three de-
grees of culpa,—lata culpa, gross fault or neglect;
levis culpa, ordinary fault or neglect; levissima
culpa, slight fault or neglect,—and the definitions
of these degrees are precisely the same as those
in our law. Story, Bailm. § 18. This term is to
be distinguished from dolus, which means fraud,
guile, or deceit.

## CULPA CARET QUI SCIT SED PROHIBERE NON POTEST

He is clear of blame who knows,
but cannot prevent. Dig. 50, 17, 50.

## CULPA EST IMMISCERE SE REL AD SE NON PERTINENTI

2 Inst. 208. It is a fault for any

## CULPA LATA DOLO ZEQUIPARATUR

negligence is held equivalent to intentional wrong.
CULPA TENET [TENEAT] SUOS AUCTORES.
Misconduct binds [should bind] its own authors.
It is a never-failing axiom that every one is ac-
countable only for his own delicts. Ersk.Inst. 4,
1, 14.

## CULPABILIS

Lat. In old English law. Guilty.
Culpabilis de intrusione,—guilty of intrusion. Fle-
ta, lib. 4, c. 30, § 11. Non culpabilis, (abbreviated
to non cul.) In criminal procedure, the plea of
"not guilty." See Culprit.

## CULPABLE

Blamable; censurable; involving
the breach of a legal duty or the commission of
a fault. The term is not necessarily equivalent to
"criminal," for, in present use, and notwithstand-
ing its derivation, it implies that the act or conduct
spoken of is reprehensible or wrong but not that
it involves malice or a guilty purpose. "Culpable"
in fact connotes fault rather than guilt. Railway
Co. v. Clayberg, 107 Ill. 651; Cain v. State, 55 Ga.
App. 376, 190 S.E. 371, 374.
As to culpable "Homicide," "Ignorance," "Neg-
lect," and "Negligence," "Wantonness," see those
titles.
It also means that which is deserving of moral blame.

Com'r, 197 Miss. 387, 21 So.2d 25, 28.

## CULPA NENA PAR ESTO. DEENA AD MEN- SURAM DELICTI STATUENDA EST

Let the
punishment be proportioned to the crime. Punish-
ment is to be measured by the extent of the of-
fense.

## CULPRIT

A person who is indicted for a crimi-
nal offense, but not yet convicted. It is not, how-
ever, a technical term of the law; and in its ver-
nacular usage it seems to imply only a light de-
gree of censure or moral reprobation.
Blackstone believes it an abbreviation of the
old forms of arraignment, whereby, on the pris-
oner's pleading not guilty, the clerk would re-
spond, "culpabilis, prit," e., he is guilty and the
crown is ready. It was (he says) the viva voce
replication, by the clerk, on behalf of the crown,
to the prisoner's plea of non culpabilis; prit being
a technical word, anciently in use in the formula
of joining issue. 4 Bl.Comm. 339.
But a more plausible explanation is that given
by Donaldson, (cited Whart.Lex.,) as follows:
The clerk asks the prisoner, "Are you guilty, or
not guilty?" Prisoner "Not guilty." Clerk, "Qu'il
paroit, [may it prove so.] How will you be tried?"
Prisoner, "By God and my country." These words
being hurried over, came to sound, "culprit, how
will you be tried?" The ordinary derivation is
from culpa.

## CULRACH

In old Scotch law. A species of
pledge or cautioner, (Scottice back borgh,) used
in cases of the replevin of persons from one man's

## CULTIVATE

reap, manage and improve in husbandry. Miller v.
Richey, Tex.Civ.App., 173 S.W.2d 490, 493.

## CULTIVATED

A field on which a crop of wheat
is growing is a cultivated field, although not a
stroke of labor may have been done in it since the
seed was put in the ground, and it is a cultivated
field after the crop is removed. It is, strictly, a
cultivated piece of ground. Combs v. Rockingham
County Com'rs, 170 N.C. 87, 86 S.E. 963, 964; An-
gus Cattle Co. v. McLeod, 98 Neb. 108, 152 N.W.

mento annexo (of the goods not [already] admin-
Often abbreviated d. b. n. c. t. a. 2 Bl. Comm. 503,
CUMULATIVE. Additional; heaping up; in-
creasing; forming an aggregate. The word sig-
nifies that two things are to be added together,
instead of one being a repetition or in substitu-
tion of the other. People v. Superior Court, 10

## CUMULATIVE EVIDENCE

Additional or cor-
roborative evidence to the same point. That which
goes to prove what has already been established
by other evidence. Glidden v. Dunlap, 28 Me.
383; Parker v. Hardy, 24 Pick., Mass., 248; Wal-
ler v. Graves, 20 Conn. 310; Roe v. Kalb, 37 Ga.
459; Purcell Envelope Co. v. United States, 48
Ct.C1. 66, 73.
All evidence material to the issue, after any such evi-
dence has been given, is in a certain sense cumulative;
that is, is added to what has been given before. It tends to
sustain the issue. But cumulative evidence, in legal
phrase, means evidence from the same or a new witness,
simply repeating, in substance and effect, or adding to,
what has been before testified to. Parshall v. Klinck, 43
Barb., N.Y., 212. Evidence is not cumulative merely
because it tends to establish the same ultimate or prin-
cipally controverted fact. Cumulative evidence is addi-
tional evidence of the same kind to the same point. Able
v. Frazier, 43 Iowa, 177; Harlan v. Texas Fuel & Supply
Co., Tex.Civ.App., 160 S.W. 1142, 1146.
Cumulative Offense
One which can be committed only by a repeti-
tion of acts of the same kind but committed on
different days. The offense of being a "common
seller" of intoxicating liquors is an example.
Wells v. Corn., 12 Gray., Mass., 328.
Cumulative Remedy
A remedy created by statute in addition to one
which still remains in force. Railway Co. v. Chi-
cago, 148 Ill. 141, 35 N.E. 881; State v. Barboglio,
63 Utah, 432, 226 P. 904, 907; Philip Levy & Co. v.
Davis, 115 Va. 814, 80 S.E. 791, 794; Wulff-Hansen
& Co. v. Silvers, Cal.App., 120 P.2d 677, 680.
Cumulative Voting
A system of voting, by which the elector, hav-
ing a number of votes equal to the number of of-
ficers to be chosen, is allowed to concentrate the
whole number of his votes upon one person, or
to distribute them as he may see fit. For exam-
ple, if ten directors of a corporation are to be
elected, then, under this system, the voter may
cast ten votes for one person, or five votes for
each of two persons, etc. It is intended to secure
representation of a minority. Bridgers v. Sta-
ton, 150 N.C. 216, 63 S.E. 892; Chicago Macaroni
Mfg. Co. v. Boggiano, 202 Ill. 312, 67 N.E. 17;

## CURFEW

An institution supposed to have been
introduced into England by order of William the
Conqueror, which consisted in the ringing of a
bell or bells at eight o'clock at night, at which
signal the people were required to extinguish all
lights in their dwellings, and to put out or rake
up their fires, and retire to rest, and all companies
to disperse. The word is probably derived from.
the French couvre feu, to cover the fire. The cur-
few is spoken of in 1 Social England 373, as hav-
ing been ordained by William I, in order to pre-
vent nightly gatherings of the people of England.
But the custom is evidently older than the Nor-
man; for we find an order of King Alfred that
the inhabitants of Oxford should at the ringing
of that bell cover up their fires and go to bed.
And there is evidence that the same practice pre-
vailed at this period in France, Normandy, Spain,
and probably in most of the other countries of
Europe. Henry, Hist. of Britain, vol. 3, 567. It
was doubtless intended as a precaution against
fires, which were very frequent and destructive
when most houses were built of wood. It ap-
pears to have met with so much opposition that
in 1103 we find Henry I, repealing the enactment
of his father on the subject; and Blackstone says
that, though it is mentioned a century afterwards,
it is rather spoken of as a time of night than as
a still subsisting custom. Shakespeare frequently
refers to it in the same sense.

law to hold it. Gilman v. Williams, 7 Wis. 334, 76
Am.Dec. 219; McFarland Carriage Co. v. Solanes,

It results from a long series of actions, constantly

mon consent. Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Reverman, 243 Ky.
702, 49 S.W.2d 558, 560.

consent of our ancestors. Termes de la Ley; Cowell;
Bract.fol. 2. Portuguese Beneficial Ass'n v. Xavier, 59 R.I.

if particular to this or that place, it is then properly cus-
tom. 3 Salk. 112.
Customs result from a long series of actions constantly
repeated, which have, by such repetition, and by unin-
terrupted acquiescence, acquired the force of a tacit and
common consent. Civil Code La..art. 3.
It differs from prescription, which is personal and is
annexed to the person of the owner of a particular estate;
while the other is local, and relates to a particular district.
An instance of the latter occurs where the question is upon
the manner of conducting a particular branch of trade at a
certain place; of the former, where a certain person and
his ancestors, or those whose estates he has, have been
entitled to a certain advantage or privilege, as to have
common of pasture in a certain close, or the like. The
distinction has been thus expressed : "While prescription
is the making of a right, custom is the making of a law."
Lawson, Usages & Cust. 15, note 2.
Classification
Customs are general, local or particular. Gen-
eral customs are such as prevail throughout a
country and become the law of that country, and
their existence is to be determined by the court.
Bodfish v. Fox, 23 Me. 95,. 39 Am.Dec. 611. Or as
applied to usages of trade and business, a general
custom is one that is followed in all cases by all
persons in the same business in the same terri-
tory, and which has been so long established that
persons sought to be charged thereby, and all
others living in the vicinity, may be presumed to
have known of it and to have acted upon it as
they had occasion. Sturges v. Buckley, 32 Conn.
267; Railroad Co. v. Harrington, 192 Ill. 9, 61
N.E. 622. Local customs are such as prevail only
in some particular district or locality, or in some
city, county, or town. Clough v. Wing, 2 Ariz. 371,
17 P. 457. Particular customs are nearly the same,
being such as affect only the inhabitants of some
particular district. 1 Bl.Comm. 74.
Custom of Merchants
A system of customs or rules relative to bills of
exchange, partnership, and other mercantile mat-
ters, and which, under the name of the "lex merca-
toria," or "law merchant," has been ingrafted in-
to and made a part of, the common law. 1 BL
Comm. 75; 1 Steph.Comm. 54; 2 Burrows, 1226,
Custom of York
A custom of intestacy in the province of York
similar to that of London. Abolished by 19 & 20
Vict. c. 94.
Customs and Services
Annexed to the tenure of lands are those which
the tenants thereof owe unto their lords, and
which, if withheld, the lord might anciently have
resorted to "a writ of customs and services" to
compel them. Cowell. But at the present day he
would merely proceed to eject the tenant as upon
a forfeiture, or claim damages for the subtrac-
tion. Brown.
Customs of London
Certain particular customs, peculiar to that
city, with regard to trade, apprentices, 'Widows,
orphans and a variety of other matters; con-
trary to the general law of the land, but con-
firmed by act of parliament. 1 Bl.Comm. 75,
Special Custom
A particular or local custom; one which, in
respect to the sphere of its observance, does not
extend throughout the entire state or country, but
is confined to some particular district or locality.

## CY-PRES

As near as [possible]. The rule of

party is carried out as near as may be, when it
would be impossible or illegal to give it literal
effect. Thus, where a testator attempts to create
a perpetuity, the court will endeavor, instead of
making the devise entirely void, to explain the
will in such a way as to carry out the testator's
general intention as far as the rule against per-
petuities will allow. So in the case of bequests
to charitable uses; and particularly where the
language used is so vague or uncertain that the
testator's design must be sought by construction.

CZAR. (Also written zar, tsar, tzar, etc.) The
title of the former emperors of Russia, derived
from the old Slavonic cesar, king or emperor,
which, although long held to be derived from the
Roman title Caesar, is almost certainly of Tartar
origin. 8 Encyc. Americana, 378. The Slavonic
word ultimately represents the Latin Caesar, but
came, according to Miklosich, through the medium
of a Germanic language in which the word had
the general sense "emperor." 2 New English
Dict. (Oxford, 1893), page 1308.
In the beginning of the 10th century the Bulgarian
prince Symeon assumed this title, which remained at-
tached to the Bulgarian crown. In 1346 it was adopted by
Stephen Duschan, king of Serbia. Among the Russians
the Byzantine emperors were so called, as were also the
khans of the Mongols that ruled in Russia. Ivan III, grand
prince of Moscow, held the title, and Ivan IV, the Terrible,
in 1547, caused himself to be crowned as czar. In 1721 the
Senate and clergy conferred on Peter I, in the name of the
nation, the title Emperor of Russia, for which in Russia
the Latin word imperator Is used. 8 Encyc.Americana,
378. Peter the Great introduced the title imperator, "em-
peror," and the official style then became "Emperor of all
the Russias, Tsar of Poland, and Grand Duke of Finland" ;
but the Russian popular appellation continued to be tsar
(the preferable modern spelling). 2 New English Diet.
1308. The last tsar was Nicholas II, who abdicated on
March 15, 1917, and was later executed.

## CZAREVITCH

(Also spelled czarewich, tsare-
vitch, and, after the Polish, czarowitz, czarowitch,
etc. 2 New English Dict. 1308.) A son of the
Russian czar and czarina. Originally a title.
Webster, Dict. The word was used as a title
during the time of Peter I and his son, Alexis,
after whose death imperial princes were called
grand dukes. 6 New Internatl. Encyc. 420.

## CZAREVNA, TS AREVNA

A daughter of the
Russian czar. Originally a title. Webster, Dict.
As a title, however, the word has been superseded,
since the time of Paul I (1754-1801), by that of
grand duchess. New Internatl. Encyc. 420; 2
New English Diet. 1308. See Czarevitch; Cesarev-
na.

## CZARINA

The title of former empresses of
Russia.

## CZARITZA, TSARITSA

The Russian title for
which czarina is in ordinary English use. 2 New
