## YEAR

The period in which the revolution of the
earth round the sun, and the accompanying
changes in the order of nature, are completed.
Generally, when a statute speaks of a year, twelve
calendar, and not lunar, months are intended.
Cro.Jac. 166. The year is either astronomical, ec-
clesiastical, or regnal, beginning on the 1st of
January, or 25th of March, or the day of the sov-
ereign's accession. Wharton.
The civil year differs from the astronomical, the
latter being composed of three hundred and sixty-
five days, five hours, forty-eight minutes, forty-
six seconds and a fraction, while the former con-
sists sometimes of three hundred and sixty-five
days, and at others, in leap-years, of three hundred
and sixty-six days.
When the period of a "year" is named, a calen-
dar year is generally intended, but the subject-mat-
ter or context of statute or contract in which the
term is found or to which it relates may alter its
meaning. J. L. Hammett Co. v. Alfred Peates Co.,
105 N.E. 370, 217 Mass. 520, L.R.A.1915A, 334;
United States Trust Co. v. Commissioner of Cor-
porations and Taxation, 299 Mass. 296, 13 N.E.2d
6, 299 Mass. 296.
Natural Year
In old English law. That period of time in
which the sun was supposed to revolve in its orbit,
consisting of 365 days and one-fourth of a day, or
six hours. Bract. fol. 359b.
Year and Day
This period was fixed for many purposes in law.
Thus, in the case of an estray, if the owner did
not claim it within that time, it became the prop-
erty of the lord. So the owners of wreck must
claim it within a year and a day. Death must
follow upon wounding within a year and a day
if the wounding is to be indicted as murder. Also,
a year and a day were given for prosecuting or
avoiding certain legal acts; e. g., for bringing
actions after entry, for making claim for avoiding
a fine, etc. Brown.
Year Books
Books of reports of cases in a regular series
from the reign of the English King Edward I.,
inclusive, to the time of Henry VIII., which were
taken by the prothonotaries or chief scribes of the
courts, at the expense of the crown, and published
annually; whence their name, "Year Books."
Brown.
Year, Day, and Waste
In English law. An ancient prerogative of the
king, whereby he was entitled to the profits, for
a year and a day, of the lands of persons attainted
of petty treason or felony, together with the right
of wasting the tenements, afterwards restoring
the property to the lord of the fee. Abrogated
by St. 54 Geo. III., c. 145. Wharton.
See An, Jour, et Waste.
Year of Our Lord
In England the time of an offense may be al-
leged as that of the sovereign's reign, or as that
of the year of our Lord. The former is the usual
mode. Hence there "year" alone might not indi-
cate the time intended, but as we have no other
era, therefore, any particular year must mean that
year in our era. Com. v. Doran, 14 Gray (Mass.)
38. The abbreviation A. D. may be omitted; and
the word year is not fatal; State v. Bartlett, 47
Me. 393; contra, Com. v. McLoon, 5 Gray (Mass.)
92, 66 Am.Dec. 354.
Year to Year, Tenancy from
This estate arises either expressly, as when land
is let from year to year; or by a general parol
demise, without any determinate interest, but re-
serving the payment of an annual rent; or im-
pliedly, as when property is occupied generally
under a rent payable yearly, half-yearly, or quar-
terly; or when a tenant holds over, after the ex-
piration of his term, without having entered into
any new contract, and pays rent, (before which
he is tenant on sufferance.) Wharton. See, also,
Tenant, subtitle Tenant from Year to Year.

See Estate for Years.

## YEAR OF MOURNING

The Roman "annus luc-
tus" (q. v.).
The reason for the widow's year of mourning has been
stated as follows: "But if a man dies, and his widow
soon after marries again, and a child is born within
such a time as by the course of nature it might have been
the child of either husband, in this case he is said to be
more than ordinarily legitimate; for he may, when he
arrives at years of discretion, choose which of the fathers
he pleases. To prevent this, the civil law ordained that
no widow should marry for one year, and the same con-
stitution was probably transmitted to our ancestors from
the Romans, during their stay in Britain, for we find it
established under the Saxon and Danish governments."
1 Bl. Comm. 456 (quoted from Browne's Abr., p. 151
[Gavit's Ed., p. 198]).
