Abandonment in law depends upon concurrence of inten-
tion to abandon and some overt act or failure to act which
carries implication that owner neither claims nor retains
920, 922.
"Abandonment" includes both the intention to abandon
and the external act by which the intention is carried into
effect. In determining whether one has abandoned his
property or rights, the intention is the first and para-
mount object of inquiry, for there can be no abandon-
ment without the intention to abandon. Boatman v. An-
dre, 44 Wyo. 352, 12 P.2d 370, 373. Generally, "abandon-
ment" can arise from a single act or from a series of acts.
Holly Hill Lumber Co. v. Grooms, 16 S.E.2d 816, 821, 198
S.C. 118.
Time is not an essential element of "abandonment,"
although the lapse of time may be evidence of an inten-
tion to abandon, and where it is accompanied by acts man-
ifesting such an intention, it may be considered in deter-
mining whether there has been an abandonment. Ullman
ex rel. Eramo v. Payne, 127 Conn. 239, 16 A.2d 286, 287.
Mere nonuser is not necessarily an abandonment. Har-
nett v. Dickinson, 93 Md. 258. 48 A. 838 (home); Welsh v.
Taylor, 131 N.Y. 450, 31 N.E. 896, 18 L.R.A. 535: Phillis v.
Gross, 32 S.D. 438. 143 N.W. 373, 378 (contract for deed).
See, however, Corkran, Hill & Co. v. A. H. Kuhlemann Co.,
136 Md. 525, 111 A. 471, 474 (trademark). Distinguished
from neglect: City of Vallezo v. Burrill, 64 Cal.App. 399,
221 P. 676 (pipe line).
"Abandonment" differs from surrender in that surrender
requires an agreement, Noble v. Sturm, 210 Mich. 462,
178 N.W. 99, 103; and from forfeiture, in that forfeiture
may be against the intention of the party alleged to have
forfeited, Gila Water Co. v. Green, 29 Ariz. 304, 241 P. 307,
In the Civil and French Law it is the act by
which a debtor surrenders his property for the
benefit of his creditors; Merlin, Repert. See
Abandonment for Torts.

Mineral Leases
"Abandonment" consists of an actual act of re
linquishment, accompanied with the intent an
purpose permanently to give up a claim and righ
of property. A distinction exists between "aban
donment" and "surrender" which is the relinquish
ment of a thing or a property right thereto t
another, which is not an essential element o
elements of "abandonment" and those of estoppel.
- Neither formal surrender of oil and gas lease nor
release is necessary to effectuate "abandonment."

App., 276 S.W. 936, 938. Voluntary, intentional

is not sufficient. Crane v. French, 39 Cal.App.2d 642, 104
P.2d 53, 60. And one co-owner's abandoning his interest
is not an "abandonment" of entire claim. Crane v.
French, 39 Ca1.App.2d 642, 104 P.2d 53, 60.
Motions
Motion not called to court's attention until final
hearing, Williams v. Smith, 149 Fla. 735, 6 So.2d
853, 854. Grounds not insisted on, Meador v. Now-
ell, 67 Ga.App. 564, 21 S.E.2d 312, 314; not argued
in brief, In re Horton's Estate, 154 Kan. 269, 118 P.
2d 527, 531. Rulings not urged on appeal, Spears v.
Brown Paper Mill Co., La.App., 9 So.2d 332, 334.
Admitting sufficiency of evidence to sustain ver-
dict, Copeland v. State, 66 Ga.App. 142, 17 S.E.2d
288, 289. But service of answer after making of
motion to strike out portions of a complaint was
not an "abandonment" of the motion. Russo v.
Signode Steel Strapping Co., Sup., 37 N.Y.S.2d
Office
Abandonment of a public office is a species of
resignation, but differs from resignation in that
resignation is a formal relinquishment, while
abandonment is a voluntary relinquishment
through nonuser. State v. Harmon, 115 Me. 268,
98 A. 804, 805.
It is not wholly a matter of intention, but may result
from the complete abandonment of duties of such a con-
tinuance that the law will infer a relinquishment. Wilk-
inson v. City of Birmingham, 193 Ala. 139, 68 So. 999, 1002.
It must be total, and under such circumstances as clearly
to indicate an absolute relinquishment; and whether an
officer has abandoned an office depends on his overt acts
rather than his declared intention. Parks v. Ash, 168 Ga.
868, 149 S.E. 207, 209. It implies nonuser, but nonuser does
not, of itself constitute abandonment. The failure to per
form the duties pertaining to the office must be with actual
or imputed intention on the part of the officer to abandon
and relinquish the office. The intention may be inferred
from the acts and conduct of the party, and is a question
of fact. Abandonment may result from an acquiescence
by the officer in his wrongful removal or discharge, but,
as in other cases of abandonment, the question of inten-
tion is involved. McCall v. Cull, 51 Ariz. 237, 75 P.2d 696,
Temporary absence is not ordinarily sufficient to consti-
tute an "abandonment of office". State v. Green, 206 Ark.
361, 175 S.W.2d 575, 577. Responding to mandatory call
for military service in emergency conditions, Caudel v.
Prewitt, 296 Ky. 848, 178 S.W.2d 22, 25. And failure of
former officers to assert right while decision of eligibility
of elected successors was pending, was not an "abandon-
ment" creating vacancy. State v. Levy Court of New Cas-
tle County, Del., 3 W.W.Harr. 554, 140 A. 642, 645.
Oil Wells
Where owner ceased working on well to work
elsewhere to procure money to do further work on
well, well was not abandoned. Jones v. Jos.
Greenspon's Son Pipe Corporation, 313 Ill.App.
651, 40 N.E.2d 561.
Patents
There may be an abandonment of a patent,
where the inventor dedicates it to the public use;
and this may be shown by his failure to sue in-
fringers, sell licenses, or otherwise make efforts
to realize a personal advantage from his patent.
Ransom v. New York, 4 Blatchf. 157, 20 Fed.Cas.
Pleadings
The filing of a second amended complaint which
was complete in itself and which did not reserve
to itself any part of the original complaint or
first amended complaint constituted an "abandon-
ment" of the two former complaints. Seely v.
Gilbert, 16 Wash.2d 611, 134 P.2d 710, 712. Cross-
complainant by failing to take proper steps in
trial court to have judgment that was silent on
issues tendered by cross-complaint and answer
thereto corrected did not thereby "abandon" cross-
complaint. Brown v. National Life Ins. Co. of
Washington County, Vt., 112 Ind.App. 684, 46 N.E.
2d 246, 249.
Prescriptive Rights
Non-use alone is insufficient. Burkman v. City
of New Lisbon, 246 Wis. 547, 19 N.W.2d 311, 313;
Smelcer v. Rippetoe, 24 Tenn.App. 516, 147 S.W.2d
109, 113, 114.
Privileges
Witness before grand jury who answered ques-
and thereupon asserted his privilege, did not
"abandon" right to claim the privilege. United
States v. Weisman, C.C.A.N.Y., 111 F.2d 260, 261.
Property
"Abandoned property" in a legal sense is that to
which owner has relinquished all right, title, claim,
and possession, with intention of not reclaiming it
or resuming its ownership, possession or enjoy-
ment. Jackson v. Steinberg, Or., 200 P.2d 376,
377, 378.
There must be concurrence of act and intent, that is, the
act of leaving the premises or property vacant, so that it
may be appropriated by the next comer, and the intention
of not returning. Cohn v. San Pedro, L. A. & S. L. R. Co.,
103 Cal.App. 496, 284 P. 1051, 1052. Relinquishment of all
title, possession, or claim; a virtual intentional throwing
away of property. Ex parte Szczygiel, Sup., 51 N.Y.S.2d
699, 702. Actual relinquishment, gas in pipe was not aban-
doned. Hein v. Shell Oil Co., 315 Ill.App. 297, 42 N.E.2d
949, 952. Nor was a sewing machine and phonograph left
with landlady as security. Dickens v. Singer Sewing
Mach. Co., 140 So. 296, 298, 19 La.App. 735.
Property for Special Purposes
Moving of church to erect drilling rig held not
"abandonment of use for church purposes." Aban-
donment meant to wholly discontinue church use,
and additional use was not sufficient. Skipper v.
Davis, Tex.Civ.App., 59 S.W.2d 454, 457.
Merger of churches was not. Bridgeport-City Trust Co.
v. Bridgeport Hospital, 120 Conn. 27, 179 A. 92, 94. Nor
where intention was that nonconforming use as a fraterni-
ty house would be resumed. State ex rel. Morehouse v.
Hunt, 235 Wis. 358, 291 N.W. 745, 751, 752. Nor mere
cessation of a nonconforming use in zoned area for a rea-
sonable period. Beyer v. Mayor and Council of Baltimore
City, Md., 34 A.2d 765, 768, 769. Nor a discontinuance of
a garage during war while owner served in army and on
return postponed repossession for garage purposes due to
city's using building. State v. Murray, 195 Wis. 657, 219
N.W. 271, 272. But removal of manufacturing equipment
from manufacturing plant, was. Francisco v. City of Co-
lumbus, Ohio App., 31 N.E.2d 236, 243. And also disposing
of all machinery, taking down smokestack and using prop-
erty for storage purposes, notwithstanding vague intention
of resuming slaughter house business. Beyer v. Mayor and
City Council of Baltimore City, 182 Md. 444, 34 A.2d 765,
768, 769.
Dedicated use must wholly fail. Kirchen v. Remenga,
291 Mich. 94, 288 N.W. 344, 350, 351. Erection of buildings
on park lands without objection of adjoining owners was
not sufficient. Kirchen v. Remenga, 291 Mich. 94, 288 N.W.
344, 350, 351. Nor city's permitting a citizen's rock garden
on small portion of street improvement tract. Kendrick
V. City of St. Paul, 213 Minn. 283, 6 N.W.2d 449, 451. Nor
diverting parkway to roadway. Ford v. City of Detroit,
273 Mich. 449, 263 N.W. 425, 426. Nor tearing down school
building for salvaging material for erection of a waiting
station for school children. McCullough v. Swifton Consol.
School Dist., 202 Ark. 1074, 155 S.W.2d 353. Nor temporary
disuse of school when land was offered for sale, later
rescinded. Bernard v. Bowen, 214 N.C. 121, 198 S.E. 584.
Railroad Property
"Abandon" means to relinquish or give up with
intent of never again resuming or claiming one's
rights or interests in, to give up absolutely, to for-
sake entirely, to renounce utterly, to relinquish all
connection with or concern in. Capital Transit Co.
v. Hazen, 93 F.2d 250, 251, 68 App.D.C. 91. Aban-
donment did not mean a partial disuse with an in-
tention to complete station on a contingency, but
out intention of resuming. Wheeling & L. E. Ry.
Co. v. Pittsburgh & W. V. Ry. Co., C.C.A.Ohio, 33
F.2d WO, 392. And to constitute an "abandon-
ment" of right of way, there must be not only an
actual relinquishment of the property, but an in-
tention to abandon it. Abens v. Chicago, B. & Q.
R. Co., 388 Ill. 261, 57 N.E.2d 883, 887.
Nonuser is a fact in determining it, but, though contin-
ued for years, is not conclusive. Arlington Realty Co. v.
Keller, 105 N.J.Eq. 196, 147 A. 437, 438. Plowing up ser-
vient estate is not enough. Les v. Alibozek, 269 Mass. 153.
168 N.E. 919, 922, 66 A.L.R. 1094. Nor proposal to deliver
and receive freight by motortrucks. New York Dock Ry.
v Pennsylvania R. Co., D.C.Pa., 1 F.Supp. 20, 21. But
failure to maintain and use that part of railroad on land
conveyed constituted "abandonment." Atlantic Coast Line
R. Co. v. Sweat, 177 Ga. 698, 171 S.E. 123, 129.
Remedies
Election of one of two inconsistent remedies,
Lumber Mutual Casualty Ins. Co. of New York v.
Friedman, 176 Misc. 703, 28 N.Y.S.2d 506, 509.
Rights in General
The relinquishment of a right. It implies some
act of relinquishment done by the owner without
regard to any future possession by himself, or by
any other person, but with an intention to aban-
don. Dyer v. Sanford, 9 Mete., Mass., 395, 43 Am.
Dec. 399.
It Is properly confined to incorporeal hereditaments,
since legal rights once vested must be divested according to
law. But equitable rights may be abandoned. Great Falls
Co. v. Worster, 15 N.H. 412; Cox v. Colossal Cavern Co.,
210 Ky. 612, 276 S.W. 540; Inhabitants of School Dist. No.
4 v. Benson, 31 Me. 381, 52 Am. Dec. 618.

S.S. Co., 148 F. 185, 78 C.C.A. 319.
In France and other countries it is the surrender to a
person having a claim arising out of a contract made with
the master. American Transp. Co. v. Moore, 5 Mich. 368.
Taxing Power
Delegation of taxing power by legislature to
city was not "abandonment of taxing power".
Mouledoux V. Maestri, 197 La. 525, 2 So.2d 11, 16.
Trade-marks and Trade Names
There must be not only nonuser, but also an
intent to abandon. Rockowitz Corset & Brassiere
Corporation v. Madame X Co., 248 N.Y. 272, 162 N.
E. 76, 78; Manz v. Philadelphia Brewing Co., D.C.
Pa., 37 F.Supp. 79, 81. To give up use of trade-
marks permanently. Neva-Wet Corporation of
America v. Never Wet Processing Corporation,
277 N.Y. 163, 13 N.E.2d 755, 761.
Disuse not sufficient in itself. Sherwood Co. v. Sherwood
Distilling Co., 177 Md. 455, 9 A.2d 842, 845. Nor using
owner's name. Bunte Bros. v. Standard Chocolates, D.C.
Mass., 45 F.Supp. 478, 480. However, nonuser with ex-
tensive use by another is sufficient. Sherwood Co. v. Sher-
wood Distilling Co., 177 Md. 455, 9 A.2d 842, 845. But not
where receiver continuously operated trade-mark licensee's
property. American Dirigold Corporation v. Dirigold Met-

for emergency cases, did not establish an "aban-
donment of trust". Noble v. First Nat. Bank of
Anniston, 241 Ala. 85, 1 So.2d 289, 291.
Water Rights
"'Abandonment," as applied to water rights may
be defined to be an intentional relinquishment
of a known right. It is not based on a time ele-
ment, and mere nonuser will not establish "aban-
donment" for any less time," at least, than statu-
tory period, controlling element in "abandonment"
being matter of intent. Hammond v. Johnson, 94
Utah 20, 66 P.2d 894, 899. To desert or forsake
right. The intent and an actual relinquishment
must concur. Central Trust Co. v. Culver, 23 Colo.
App. 317, 129 P. 253, 254. Concurrence of relin-
quishment of possession, and intent not to resume
it for beneficial use. Neither alone is sufficient.
Osnes Livestock Co. v. Warren, 103 Mont. 284, 62
P.2d 206, 211.
Not using water when there was no water in creek be-
cause of another user's obstruction of flow and appropria-
tion of all the water did not constitute. New Mexico Prod-
ucts Co. v. New Mexico Power Co., 42 N.M. 311, 77 P.2d
634, 641. Nor did milling company's permitting water's
use by upper irrigators. Hutchinson v. Stricklin, 146 Or.
285, 28 P.2d 225, 230. Nor permitting upper appropriators
to erect dam and store water. Irion v. Hyde, Mont., 81 P.
2d 353, 356. Nor change of place of use of decreed water
right. Harris v. Chapman, 51 Idaho 283, 5 P.2d 733, 737. Nor
failure to use all water to which entitled. Horse Creek
Conservation Dist. v. Lincoln Land Co., 54 Wyo. 320, 92
P.2d 572, 577. Use of only enough water to water stock.
because supply was insufficient to irrigate land. Federal
Land Bank v. Morris, 112 Mont. 445, 116 P.2d 1007, 1010.
But right to use a particular quantity of water may be
abandoned by failure to apply such water to a beneficial
use for an unreasonable period of time. Cundy v. Weber,
68 S.D. 214, 300 N.W. 17, 22.
Wife
Abandonment justifying divorce is a voluntary,
unjustified, and final separation of one of married
parties from the other, accompanied by an inten-
tion to terminate the marital relation, or an un-
justified refusal to resume suspended cohabita-
tion, as where husband left his wife because his
children by former marriage could not live peace-
ably with second wife. Schwartz v. Schwartz,
158 Md. 80, 148 A. 259, 263.
Refusal by husband of request by sick wife without
means of support, to return to home held "abandonment"
as respects disorderly conduct. People v. Schenkel, 252
N.Y.S. 415, 418, 140 Misc. 843. Contra where separation
agreement existed. People v. Gross, 291 N.Y.S. 597, 601,
161 Misc. 514. Where parties separated by agreement, and
husband, in lieu of periodic payments for wife's support,
made conveyance constituting valuable consideration, held
not "abandonment" as respects husband's statutory right
against wife's will. In re McCann's Estate, 281 N.Y.S. 445,
155 Misc. 763; or even if wife was justified in leaving hus-
band on account of his cruel treatment, there must be a
desertion without consent. In re Stolz' Estate, 260 N.Y.S.
906, 145 Misc. 799. But while there can be no "desertion"
for divorce where parties are apart by consent, yet there
may be an "abandonment" as respects separate mainte-
nance, although the separation originated and continued
15 N.J.Misc. 117. And as respects maintenance, husband's
conduct rendering wife's condition unendurable constitutes
"abandonment." Carder v. Carder, 227 Mo.App. 1005, 60
S.W.2d 706. Cruel treatment, Fallon v. Fallon, 111 N.J.
Eq. 512, 162 A. 406, 408. Husband's refusal of wife's
request to resume living with her, Clark v. Clark, 176 A.
81, 83, 13 N.J.Misc. 49; or refusal to receive wife at his
residence, is an "abandonment" of her. Hockaday v.
Hockaday, 182 La. 88, 161 So. 164. But not a husband's
removal from wife's home after wife had instituted sep-
aration action, Kenneson v. Kenneson, 36 N.Y.S.2d 676, 685,
178 Misc. 832; or where husband moved out on command
of wife's father. Anonymous v. Anonymous, 24 N.Y.S.2d 613,
618. Mere failure to support wife is not an abandonment
within Divorce Act. Biddle v. Biddle, 104 N.J.Eq. 313, 145
A. 639, 640; but failing to provide wife with necessities,
etc., is. Cooper v. Cooper, 176 Md. 695, 4 A.2d 714, 716.
And convict sentenced for life did not abandon wife. In
re Lindewall's Will, 18 N.Y.S.2d 281, 284, 259 App. Div. 196.

## ABANDONMENT FOR TORTS

In the civil law.
The relinquishment of a slave or animal who had
committed a trespass to the person injured, in dis-
charge of the owner's liability for such trespass or
injury. Just. Inst. 4, 8, 9. A similar right exists
in Louisiana. Fitzgerald v. Ferguson, 11 La.Ann.
ABANDUN, ABANDUM, or ABANDONUM. Any-
thing sequestered, proscribed, or abandoned.
Abandon, i. e., in bannum res missa, a thing ban
ned or denounced as forfeited or lost, whence to
abandon, desert, or forsake, as lost and gone
Cunningham; Cowell.

## ABARNARE

Lat. To discover and disclose to a
magistrate any secret crime. Leges Canuti, cap
ABATABLE NUISANCE. A nuisance which i
practically susceptible of being suppressed, or ex-
tinguished, or rendered harmless, and whose con
tinued existence is not authorized under the law
Fort Worth & Denver City Ry. Co. v. Muncy, Tex.
Civ.App., 31 S.W.2d 491, 494.

## ABATAMENTUM

L. Lat. In old English law
An abatement of freehold; an entry upon land
by way of interposition between the death of th
ancestor and the entry of the heir. Co. Litt. 277a;
Yel. 151.

## ABATARE

To abate. Yel. 151.

## ABATE

To throw down, to beat down, destroy
quash. 3 Shars. Bla. Com. 168; Klamath Lum
ber Co. v. Bamber, 142 P. 359, 74 Or. 287. , To d
away with or nullify or lessen or diminish, In r
Stevens' Estate, Cal.App., 150 P.2d 530, 534; t
bring entirely down or demolish, to put an end to
to do away with, to nullify, to make void, Spark
Milling Co. v. Powell, 283 Ky. 669, 143 S.W.2d 75,
See, also, Abatement; Abatement and Revival
ABATEMENT. A reduction, a decrease, or
diminution. The Vestris, D.C.N.Y., 53 F.2d 847
A judgment afforded a defense by way of abatement
Contracts
A reduction made by the creditor for the
prompt payment of a debt due by the payor or
debtor. Wesk. Ins. 7.
Debts
In equity, when equitable assets are insufficient
to satisfy fully all the creditors, their debts must
abate in proportion, and they must be content with
a dividend, for cequitas est quasi cequalitas.
Freehold
The unlawful entry upon and keeping posses-
sion of an estate by a stranger, after the death
of the ancestor and before the heir or devisee
takes possession. Such an entry is technically
called an "abatement," and the stranger an "aba-
tor." It is, in fact, a figurative expression, de-
noting that the rightful possession or freehold of
the heir or devisee is overthrown by the unlawful
intervention of a stranger. Abatement differs
from intrusion, in that it is always to the preju-
dice of the heir or immediate devisee, whereas the
latter is to the prejudice of the reversioner or
remainder-man; and disseisin differs from them
both, for to disseise is to put forcibly or fraudu-
lently a person seised of the freehold out of pos-
session. Brown v. Burdick, 25 Ohio St. 268. By
the ancient laws of Normandy, this term was
used to signify the act of one who, having an ap-
parent right of possession to an estate, took pos-
session of it immediately after the death of the
actual possessor, before the heir entered. (How-
ard, Anciennes Lois des Francais, tome 1, p. 539.)
Legacies
A proportional diminution or reduction of the
pecuniary legacies, when the funds or assets out
of which such legacies are payable are not suffi-
cient to pay them in full. Ward, Leg. p. 369, c. 6,
§ 7; 1 Story, Eq. Jur. § 555; 2 Bl. Comm. 512, 513;
In re 'Hawgood's Estate, 37 S.D. 565, 159 N.W.
117, 123. Legacy accepted in lieu of dower. In re
Hartman's Estate, 233 Iowa 405, 9 N.W.2d 359, 362.
Nuisance
The removal of a nuisance. 3 Bla. Comm. 5.
See Nuisance.
Taxes and Duties
A drawback or rebate allowed in certain cases
on the duties due on imported goods, in considera-
tion of their deterioration or damage suffered
during importation, or while in store. A diminu-
tion or decrease in the amount of tax imposed
upon any person. Rogers v. Gookin, 198 Mass.
434, 85 N.E. 405 (real estate taxes); Central Na-
tional Bank v. City of Lynn, 156 N.E. 42 (Shares
in national banks) 259 Mass. 1.
As applied to taxation, it presupposes error or mistake
in assessment. Gulf States Steel Co. v. U. S., C.C.A.Ala.,
56 F.2d 43, 46.
Abatement of taxes relieves property of its share of the
burdens of taxation after the assessment has been made
ABATEMENT AND REVIVAL
Actions at Law
As used in reference to actions at law, word
abate means that action is utterly dead and can-
not be revived except by commencing a new ac-
tion. First Nat. Bank v. Board of Sup'rs of Harri-
son County, 221 Iowa 348, 264 N.W. 281, 106 A.L.R.
The overthrow of an action caused by the de-
fendant's pleading some matter of fact tending to
impeach the correctness of the writ or declaration,
which defeats the action for the present, but does
not debar the plaintiff from recommencing it in a
better way. 3 Bla. Comm. 301; 1 Chit. Pl. (6th
Lond. Ed.) 446; Guild v. Richardson, 6 Pick.
(Mass.) 370; Wirtele v. Grand Lodge A. 0. U. W.,
111 Neb. 302, 196 N.W. 510. See Plea in Abate-
ment.
To put a final end to suit, Dodge v. Superior Court in
and for Los Angeles County, 139 Cal.App. 178, 33 P.2d 695,
696; overthrow of pending action apart from cause of
action, Burnand v. Irigoyen, 56 Cal.App.2d 624, 133 P.2d
3, 6.
On plaintiff's death, Piukkula v. Pillsbury Astoria
Flouring Mills Co., 150 Or. 304, 44 P.2d 162, 99 A.L.R. 259.
Mere lapse of time between the death of a party and the
taking of necessary steps to continue the action by or
against the heir or personal representative does not work
an abatement, Whaley v. Slater, 202 S.C. 182, 24 S.E.2d
266, 267.
Cause of Action
Destruction of cause of action. In re Thomas-
son, Mo., 159 S.W.2d 626, 628.
Chancery Practice
It differs from an abatement at law in this:
that in the latter the action is entirely dead and
cannot be revived; but in the former the right to
proceed is merely suspended, and may be revived;
F. A. Mfg. Co. v. Hayden & Clemons, C.C.A.Mass.,
273 F. 374; Mutual Ben. Health & Accident Ass'n
v. Teal, D.C.S.C., 34 F.Supp. 714, 716.
In England, declinatory pleas to the jurisdiction and
dilatory to the persons were (prior to the judicature act)
sometimes, by analogy to common law, termed "pleas In
abatement."
Declinatory and dilatory pleas, see Story, Eq. Pl. § 708.

App. 100, 15 S.E.2d 464, 465.

88, 1 P. 317. Where a statute provides for a recognizance
"to abide the judgment of the court," one conditioned "to
await the action of the court" is not sufficient; Wilson v.
State, 7 Tex.App. 38. Defendant does not "abide the
judgment" until costs of appeal are paid. Ex parte Til-
lery, 22 Ala.App. 193, 114 So. 15. And see State v. Greg-
ory, 205 Iowa, 707, 216 N.W. 17, 19.

ymous with conform to. Getz v. Johnston, 145 Md. 426, 125
A. 689, 691.
To abide order respecting seized property, means to per-
form, obey, conform to. Cantor v. Sachs, 18 Del.Ch. 359,

## ABIGEATORES

See Abigeus.

## ABIGEATUS

Lat. In the civil law. The offense
of stealing or driving away cattle. See Abigeus.

## ABIGEI

See Abigeus.

## ABIGERE

Lat. In the civil law. To drive away.
Applied to those who drove away animals with
the intention of stealing them. Applied, also, to
the similar offense of cattle stealing on the borders
between England and Scotland. See Abigeus.
To drive out; to expel by force; to produce
abortion. Dig. 47, 11, 4.

## ABIGEUS

Lat. (P1., abigei, or more rarely
abigeatores.) In the civil law. A stealer of cat-
tle; one who drove or drew away (subtraxit)
cattle from their pastures, as horses or oxen from
the herds, and made booty of them, and who fol-
lowed this as a business or trade.
The term was applied also to those who drove away the
smaller animals, as swine, sheep, and goats. In the latter
case, it depended on the number taken, whether the
offender was fur (a common thief) or abigeus. But the
taking of a single horse or ox seems to have constituted
the crime of abigeatus. And those who frequently did this
were clearly abigei, though they took but an animal or
two at a time. Dig. 47, 14, 3, 2. See Cod. 9, 37; Nov. 22,
c. 15, § 1; 4 Bl.Comm. 239.

## ABILITY

When the word is used instatutes, it
is usually construed as referring to pecuniary
ability, as in the construction of Tenterden's Act
(q. v.) ; 1 M. & W. 101.
Contemplates earning capacity as well as property actu-
ally owned, to support abandoned wife; State v. Witham,
70 Wis. 473, 35 N.W. 934, Contra, Washburn v. Washburn, 9
Cal. 475.
The ability to buy, required in a purchaser as a condi-
ability to meet the required terms of the sale, and does
not mean solvency or ability to respond in damages for a
breach of the contract. Stewart v. Sisk, 29 Ga.App. 17, 114
S.E. 71. See Able to Purchase.
A voter's "ability to read" within meaning of election
statutes is satisfied if he can read in a reasonably intelli-
gent manner sentences composed of words in common use
and of average difficulty, although each word may not be
always accurately pronounced, and "ability to write" is
satisfied if he can by use of alphabetical signs express in a
fairly legible way words of common use and average diffi-
culty, though each word may not be accurately spelled.
Williams v. Hays, 175 Ky. 170, 193 S.W. 1046, 1047. But the
mere ability to write one's name and post office address,
and nothing more, is insufficient. Murrel v. Allen, 180 Ky.
604, 203 S.W. 313, 314.
ABISHERING, or ABISHERSING. Quit of
amercements. It originally signified a forfeiture
or amercement, and is more properly mishering,
mishersing, or miskering, according to Spelman.
It has since been termed a liberty of freedom, be-
cause, wherever this word is used in a grant, the
persons to whom the grant is made have the for-
f•itures and amercements of all others, and are
themselves free from the control of any within
their fee. Termes de la Ley, 7.

## ABJUDICATIO

In old English law. The depriv-
ing of a thing by the judgment of a court; a
putting out of court; the same as forisjudicatio,
forjudgment, forjudger. Co.Litt. 100a, b; Townsh.

Maitl. 62.

A renunciation or abandonment
by or upon oath.
The oath by which any person holding office in England
was formerly obliged to bind himself not to acknowledge
any right in the Pretender to the throne of England; 1
Bla.Com. 368; 13 and 14 W. III, c. 6, repealed by 30 and
31 Vic. c. 59.
It also denotes an oath abjuring certain doctrines of the
church of Rome.

implied. Mead v. Hughes, 15 Ala. 148, 1 Am.Rep. 123.

## ABLE-BODIED

As used in a statute relating to
service in the militia, this term does not imply an
absolute freedom from all physical ailment. It
imports an absence of those palpable and visible
defects which evidently incapacitate the person
from performing the ordinary duties of a soldier.
Darling v. Bowen, 10 Vt. 152. Ability to perform
ordinary labor is not the test. Town of Marl-
borough v. Sisson, 26 Conn. 57.

## ABLE SEAMAN

A grade of merchant seamen.
46 U.S.C.A. § 672.

## ABLE TO EARN

The phrase in the Workmen's
Compensation Act in reference to wages does not
mean the maximum sum earned in any one week,

employee is able to earn covering a sufficient
period of time to determine his earning capacity.
Reeves v. Dietz, 1 La.App. 501, 505. See also, Mt.
Olive & Staunton Coal Co. v. Industrial Commis-
sion, 301 Ill. 521, 134 N.E. 16. Amount one is

usual duties of whatever employment may be under con-
sideration, in the manner that such duties are customarily
performed by the average person engaged in such employ-
ment. Kinyon v. Kinyon, 230 Mo.App. 623, 71 S.W.2d 78,

the necessary funds to close the deal within the time
required. Hersh v. Garau, 218 Cal. 460, 23 P.2d 1022.
Even though part of the money must be obtained on the
purchased property itself. Pellaton v. Brunski, 69 Cal.
App. 301, 231 P. 583, 584. But see Bateman v. Richard,
105 Okl. 272, 232 P. 443, 445; and Reynor v. Mackrill, 181
Iowa 210, 164 N.W. 335, 1 A.L.R. 523, holding that a
person, to be able to purchase, must have the money for
the cash payment, and not merely property on which he
could raise it. See, also, Peters v. Mullins, 211 Ky. 123,
277 S.W. 316, 317. See Financially Able.

Latin word "abolere," meaning to destroy utterly. Applies
particularly to things of a permanent nature, such as
institutions, usages, customs, as the abolition of slavery.

In the Civil, French and German law, abolition is used
nearly synonymously with pardon, remission, grace. Dig.
39, 4, 3, 3. There is, however, this difference : grace is
the generic term; pardon, according to those laws, is the
clemency which the prince extends to a man who has par-
ticipated in a crime, without being a principal or accom-
plice; remission is made in cases of involuntary homicides,
and self-defence. Abolition is used when the crime can-
not be remitted. The prince then may, by letters of aboli-
tion, remit the punishment, but the infamy remains, un-
less letters of abolition have been obtained before sentence.
Encycl. de D'Alembert.

606, 3 Pennewill (Del.) 307. The act of bringing
forth what is yet imperfect. Also the thing pre-
maturely brought forth, or product of an untimely

of procuring a premature delivery; but strictly,
the early delivering is the abortion; causing or

significance, varying with the circumstances and the con-
nection in which it is employed. Burlington Grocery Co.
v. Heaphy's Estate, 98 Vt. 122, 126 A. 525, 528. But its
use does not necessarily render time immaterial, nor make
a contract one terminable at will. Costello v. Siems-Carey
Co., 140 Minn. 208, 167 N.W. 551, 552. In a charter party,
"about to sail" means just ready to sail. [1893] 2 Q.B.

street car, it means "in the act of." Fox v. Denver City
Tramway Co., 57 Colo. 511, 143 P. 278, 280. With relation
to quantity, the term suggests only an estimate of probable
amount. Barkemeyer Grain & Seed Co. v. Hannant, 66
Mont. 120, 213 P. 208, 210. Its import is that the actual
quantity is a near approximation to that mentioned, and
it has the effect of providing against accidental varia-
tions. Norrington v. Wright, 6 S.Ct. 12, 115 U.S. 188, 29
L. Ed. 366. It may be given practically the same effect as
the phrase more or less. Pierce v. Miller, 107 Neb. 851,

estimate of a particular lot or class and not a warranty.

with distance or locality, the term is of relative signifi-
cance, varying with the circumstances. Parker v. Town of

## ABRIDGE

To reduce or contract; usually spoken
of written language.
Copyright Law
To epitomize; to reduce; to contract. It im-
plies preserving the substance, the essence, of a
work, in language suited to such a purpose. In
making extracts there is no condensation of the
author's language, and hence no• abridgment. To
not copying. Between a compilation and an
abridgment there is a clear distinction. A compila-
tion consists of selected extracts from different
authors; an abridgment is a condensation of the
views of one author. Story v. Holcombe, 4 Mc-
Lean, 306, 310, Fed.Cas.No.13,497.
Practice
To shorten a declaration or count by taking
away or severing some of the substance of it.
Brooke, Abr., Com., Dig. Abridgment; 1 Viner,
Abr. 109. See Abridgment.

## ABRIDGMENT

Condensation; contraction. An
epitome or compendium of another and larger
work, wherein the principal ideas of the larger
work are summarily contained.
Abridgments of the law are brief digests of the law,
arranged alphabetically. (1 Steph.Comm. 51.) The term
"digest" has now supplanted that of "abridgment."
Sweet.

## ABRIDGMENT OF DAMAGES

The right of the
court to reduce the damages in certain cases.
Vide Brooke, tit. "Abridgment."
ABROAD. In English chancery law, beyond the
seas.

## ABROGATE

To annul, repeal, or destroy; to
annul or repeal an order or rule issued by a sub-
ordinate authority; to repeal a former law by
legislative act, or by usage.

## ABROGATION

The destruction or annulling of
a former law, by an act of the legislative power,
by constitutional authority, or by usage.
It stands opposed to rogation; and is distinguished from
derogation, which implies the taking away only some part
of a law; from subrogation, which denotes the adding a
clause to it; from dispensation, which only sets it aside in
a particular instance; and from antiquation, which is the
refusing to pass a law. Encyc. Lond. Implied abrogation
takes place when the new law contains provisions which
are positively contrary to former laws, without expressly
abrogating such laws. Bernard v. Vignaud, 10 Mart.O.S.
La. 560; and also when the order of things for which
the law .has been made no longer exists. See Ex parte
Lum Poy, D.C., 23 F.2d 690.

hill, 188 La. 549, 177 So. 663.

## ABSCONDING DEBTOR

One who absconds
from his creditors.
An absconding debtor is one who lives without the state,
or who has intentionally concealed himself from his credi-
tors, or withdrawn himself from the reach of their suits,
with intent to frustrate their just demands. Thus, if a
person departs from his usual residence, or remains absent
therefrom, or conceals himself in his house, so that he can-
but if he departs from the state or from his usual abode,
with the intention of again returning, and without any
fraudulent design, he has not absconded, nor absented
himself, within the intendment of the law. Doughnut
Corporation of America v. Tsakirides, 121 N.J.L. 136, 1
A.2d 467, 469. A party may abscond, and subject himself
to the operation of the attachment law against absconding
debtors, without leaving the limits of the state. Field v.
Adreon, 7 Md. 209. A debtor who is shut up from his
creditors in his own house is an absconding debtor. Ives

posite of appearance at a specified time. Hamil-
ton v. Bernstein, 133 Kan. 229, 299 P. 581.
Absence is of a fivefold kind: (1) A necessary absence,
as in banished or transported persons ; this is entirely nec-
essary. (2) Necessary and voluntary, as upon the account
of the commonwealth, or in the service of the church. (3)
A probable absence, according to the civilians, as that of
students on the score of study. (4) Entirely voluntary, on
account of trade, merchandise, and the like. (5) Absence
cum dolo et culpd, as not appearing to a writ, subpoena,
citation, etc., or to delay or defeat creditors, or avoiding
arrest, either on civil or criminal process. Ayliffe. Non-
appearance to action, not merely that the party was not
present in court vacating judgment. Strine v. Kaufman,
12 Neb. 423, 11 N.W. 867. In usual and natural signifi-
cation, means physical absence. Inhabitants of Lanes-
borough v. Inhabitants of Ludlow, 250 Mass. 99, 145 N.E.

## ABSENT

Being away from; at a distance from;
not in company with.
Paine v. Drew, 44 N.H. 306, where it was held that the
word when used as an adjective referred only to the con-
dition or situation of the person or thing spoken of at
the time of speaking without reference to any prior con-
dition or situation of the same person or thing, but when
used as a verb implies prior presence. It has also been
held to mean "not being in a particular place at the time
referred to," and not to import prior presence. The term
absent defendants does not embrace non-resident defend-
ants but has reference to parties resident in the state, but
temporarily absent therefrom. Wheeler v. Wheeler, 35 Ill.
App. 123. See, however, Selmer v. James Dickinson Farm
Mortg. Co., D.C.I11., 299 F. 651, 658, holding that a foreign
corporation is "absent" from the state, and limitation does
not run in its favor. Commonwealth's attorney is "absent"

## ABSOLUTE LAW

The true and proper law of
nature, immutable in the abstract or in principle,
in theory, but not in application; for very often
the object, the reason, situation, and other cir-
cumstances, may vary its exercise and obligation.
1 Steph.Comm. 21 et seq.

## ABSOLUTELY

Completely; wholly; without
qualification; without reference or relation to, or
dependence upon, any other person, thing, or
event. Thus, absolutely void means utterly void;
Pearsoll v. Chapin, 44 Pa. 9. Absolutely neces-
sary may be used to make the idea of necessity
more emphatic; State v. Tetrick, 34 W.Va. 137, 11
S.E. 1002. An "absolutely necessary repair," with-
in terms of Wisconsin St. 1925, § 85.02, prohibit-
ing parking of vehicles except for making abso-
lutely necessary repairs, includes repair of a

215 N.W. 892, 893, 61 A.L.R. 1155. Independently
or unconditionally, wholly or positively. Collins
"Absolutely void" is that which the law or nature of
things forbids to be enforced at all, and that is "relatively
void" which the law condemns as a wrong to individuals
and refuses to enforce against them. Kyle v. Chaves, 42
N.Mex. 21, 74 P.2d 1030; Scudder v. Hart, 45 N.M. 76, 110
P.2d 536, 541.

109 A. 60, 63.

## ABSOLUTION

In Canon Law, a juridical act
whereby the clergy declare that the sins of such
as are penitent are remitted. Among Protes-
tants it is chiefly used for a sentence by which a
person who stands excommunicated is released or
freed from that punishment. Encyc. Brit.
In the Civil Law a sentence whereby a party
accused is declared innocent of the crime laid to
his charge.
In French Law, the dismissal of an accusa-
tion.
The term acquitment is employed when the accused is
declared not guilty, and absolution when he is recognized
as guilty but the act is not punishable by law or he is
exonerated by some defect of intention or will. Merlin,
Report.

## ABSQUE CONSIDERATIONE CURVE

In old
practice. Without the consideration of the court;
without judgment. Fleta, lib. 2, c. 47, § 13.

## ABSQUE HOC

Without this. These are techni-
cal words of denial, used in pleading at common
law by way of special traverse, to introduce the
negative part of the plea, following the affirma-
tive part or inducement. Martin v. Hammon, 8
Pa. 270. See, also, Traverse.
ABSQUE I1%IPETITIONE VASTI. Without im-
peachment of waste; without accountability for
waste; without liability to suit for waste. A
clause anciently often inserted in leases (as the

Bank of Fort Worth v. Ogden, Tex.Civ.App., 144
S.W.2d 998, 1004.

Taking from with intent to in-
jure or defraud, "wrongful abstraction" is "unau-
thorized and illegal taking or withdrawing of
funds, etc., and appropriation thereof to taker's
benefit." Pacific Coast Adjustment Bureau v.

App. 583, 2 P.2d 218, 219.

right senses. State v. Hayes, 81 Mo. 574, 585.
Anything which is so irrational, unnatural, or in-
convenient that it cannot be supposed to have
been within the intention of men of ordinary in-
telligence and discretion. Black, Interp. Laws,
104; Graves v. Scales, 172 N.C. 915, 90 S.E. 439;
obviously and flatly opposed to the manifest
truth; inconsistent with the plain dictates of
common sense; logically contradictory; nonsen-
sical; ridiculous. Wade v. Empire Dist. Electric
Co., 98 Kan. 366, 158 P. 28, 30.

## ABUNDANS CAUTELA NON NOCET

Abun-
dant or extreme caution does no harm. 11 Co. 6;
Fleta, lib. 1, c. 28, § 1; 6 Wheat. 108. This princi-
ple is generally applied to the construction of
instruments in which superfluous words have been
inserted more clearly to express the intention.

## ABUS DE CONFIANCE

Fraudulently misusing
or spending to anybody's prejudice goods, cash,
bills, documents, or contracts handed over for a
special object. The Washington, D.C.N.Y., 19 F.
Supp. 719, 722.

## ABUSE

Everything which is contrary to good
order established by usage. Merl. Repent. De-
parture from use; immoderate or improper use.
Action that would be necessary in ordinary affairs to,
make one guilty of an "abuse" connotes conduct of a dif-
ferent grade than what is meant when a court is said to
have "abused its discretion." Beck v. Wings Field, Inc.
C.C.A.Pa., 122 F.2d 114, 116.
Civil Law
The destruction of the substance of a thing in
using it. See Abuse, v.
Corporate Franchise or Entity
The abuse or misuse of its franchises by a cor-
poration signifies any positive act in violation of
the charter and in derogation of public right,
willfully done or caused to be done; the use of
rights or franchises as a pretext for wrongs and
injuries to the public. People v. Atlantic Ave. R.
Co., 125 N.Y. 513, 26 N.E. 622.
Discretion
"Abuse of discretion" is synonymous with a fail-
ure to exercise a sound, reasonable, and legal dis-
cretion. Disbarment, Adair v. Pennewill, 153 A.
859, 860, 4 W.W.Harr.(Del.) 390. It is a strict
legal term indicating that appellate court is
simply of opinion that there was commission of
an error of law in the circumstances. Refusing
motion to amend pleadings, Tunstall v. Lerner
Shops, 160 S.C. 557, 159 S.E. 386. Motions to con-
solidate actions, Bishop v. Bishop, 164 S.C. 493,
162 S.E. 756, 757. Vacating judgment, Detroit Fi-
delity & Surety Co. v. Foster, 171 S.C. 121, 169
S.E. 871, 881. And it does not imply intentional
wrong or bad faith, or misconduct, nor any reflec-
tion on the judge but means the clearly erroneous
conclusion and judgment—one is that clearly
against logic and effect of such facts as are pre-
sented in support of the application or against
the reasonable and probable deductions to be
drawn from the facts disclosed upon the hearing;
an improvident exercise of discretion; an error of
law. New trial, State v. Draper, 83 Utah, 115, 27
P.2d 39. Setting aside of decree pro confesso. Ex
parte Jones, 246 Ala. 433, 20 So.2d 859, 862.
A discretion exercised to an end or purpose not justified
by and clearly against reason and evidence. Trimmer v.
State, 142 Okl. 278, 286 P. 783, 786; Seaba v. State, 290 P.
1098, 1101, 144 Okl. 295. Unreasonable departure from
considered precedents and settled judicial custom, con-
stituting error of law. Beck v. Wings Field, Inc., C.C.A.
Pa., 122 F.2d 114, 116, 117. The term is commonly em-
ployed to justify an interference by a higher court with the
exercise of discretionary power by a lower court and is
said by some authorities to imply not merely error of
judgment, but perversity of will, passion, prejudice, par-
tiality, or moral delinquency. The exercise of an honest
judgment, however erroneous it may appear to be, is not
an abuse of discretion. Stroup v. Raymond, 183 Pa. 279, 38
A. 626. Where a court does not exercise a discretion in the
sense of being discreet, circumspect, prudent, and exercis-
ing cautious judgment, it is an abuse of discretion. State
Board of Medical Examiners v. Spears, 79 Colo. 588, 247 P.
563, 565. Difference in judicial opinion is not synonymous
with "abuse of judicial discretion" as respects setting aside
verdict as against evidence. Belock v. State Mut. Fire Ins.
Co., 106 Vt. 435, 175 A. .19, 22.
Distress
The using an animal or chattel distrained,
which makes the distrainer liable as for a con-
version.
Female Child
An injury to the genital organs in an attempt at
carnal knowledge, falling short of actual penetra-
tion. Lee v. State, 246 Ala. 69, 18 So.2d 706, 707.
But, according to other authorities, "abuse" is
here equivalent to ravishment or rape. Palin v.
State, 38 Neb. 862, 57 N.W. 743. Physical abuse.
Montgomery v. State, 28 Ala.App. 442, 186 So.
589, 592.
Process
There is said to be an abuse of process when
an adversary, through the malicious and unfound-
ed use of some regular legal proceeding, obtains
some advantage over his opponent. Wharton.
Employment of process for doing an act clearly
outside authority conveyed by express terms of
writ. Shane v. Gulf Refining Co., 114 Pa.Super.
87, 173 A. 738, 740.
The gist of an action for "abuse of process" is improper
use or perversion of process after it has been issued.
Publix Drug Co. v. Breyer Ice Cream Co., 347 Pa. 346, 32
A.2d 413, 415. Holding of accused incommunicado before
complying with warrant requiring accused to be taken
before magistrate. People v. Crabb, 372 Ill. 347, 24 N.E.2d
46, 49. Warrant of arrest to coerce debtor. In re Wil-
liams, 233 Mo.App. 1174, 128 S.W.2d 1098, 1105. A mali-
cious abuse of legal process occurs where the party em-
ploys it for some unlawful object, not the purpose which
it is intended by the law to effect; in other words, a
perversion of it. Lauzon v. Charroux, 18 R.I. 467, 28 A.
975. Vybiral v. Schildhauer, 265 N.W. 241, 244, 130 Neb.
433; Silverman v. Ufa Eastern Division Distribution, 236
N.Y.S. 18, 20, 135 Misc. 814. Thus, where the purpose of
a prosecution for issuance of a check without funds was
to collect a debt, the prosecution constituted an abuse of
criminal process. Hotel Supply Co. v. Reid, 16 Ala.App.
563, 80 So. 137, 138. Regular and legitimate use of process,
although with a bad intention, is not a malicious "abuse
of process." Priest v. Union Agency, 174 Tenn. 304, 125 S.
W.2d 142, 143. Action for "abuse of process" is distin-
guished from action for "malicious prosecution," in that
action for abuse of process rests upon improper use of reg-
ularly issued process, while "malicious prosecution" has
reference to wrong in issuance of process. Clikos v. Long,
231 Ala. 424, 165 So. 394, 396; McInnis v. Atlantic Inv. Cor-
poration, 137 Or. 648, 4 P.2d 314, 315; Lobel v. Trade Bank
of New York, 229 N.Y.S. 778, 781, 132 Misc. 643.

## ABUSE

To make excessive or improper use
of a thing, or to employ it in a manner contrary
to the natural or legal rules for its use; to make
an extravagant or excessive use, as to abuse one's
authority.
In the civil law, the borrower of a chattel which, in its
nature, cannot be used without consuming it. such as wine
or grain, is said to abuse the thing borrowed if he uses it.
It has been held to include misuse; Erie & North-East R.
Co. v. Casey, 26 Pa. 287; to signify to injure, diminish in
value, or wear away by improper use; id.; to be synon-
ymous with injure; Dawkins v. State, 58 Ala. 376, 29 Am.
Rep. 754.

## ABUSIVE

Tending to deceive; practicing abuse;
prone to ill treat by coarse, insulting words. U.
S. v. Ault, D.C.Wash., 263 F. 800, 810. Using
ill treatment, injurious, improper, hurtful, offen-
sive, reproachful. People on Complaint of Wil-
son v. Sinclair, 149 N.Y.S. 54, 56, 86 Misc. 426.

## ABUT

To reach, to touch. In old law, the ends
were said to abut, the sides to adjoin. Cro. Jac.
184. And see Lawrence v. Killam, 11 Kan. 499,
511; Springfield v. Green, 120 Ill. 269, 11 N.E.
261. To take a new direction; as where a bound-
ing line changes its course. Spelman, Gloss.
Abuttare. To touch at the end; be contiguous;
join at a border or boundary; terminate; to end
at; to border on; to reach or touch with an end.
Assessment of property, Hensler v. City of Ana-
cortes, 140 Wash. 184, 248 P. 406, 407. The term
"abutting" implies a closer proximity than the
term "adjacent." Reversion of vacated park land,
City of Hutchinson v. Danley, 88 Kan. 437, 129
P. 163, 164. "Contiguous" synonymous, both con-
veying idea that lot borders on improvement.
Reynard v. City of Caldwell, 55 Idaho 342, 42
P.2d 292, 296.
No intervening land. Johnson v. Town of Watertown,
131 Conn. 84, 38 A.2d 1, 4. Property at end of street sought
to be vacated. Messinger v. City of Cincinnati, 36 Ohio
App. 337, 173 N.E. 260, 262. Widen street, leaving ftee
access to paved street, property within assessment stat-
utes. Goodman v. City of Birmingham, 223 Ala. 199, 135
So. 336, 337. Though the usual meaning of the word is
that the things spoken of do actually adjoin, "bounding
and abutting" have nc, such inflexible meaning as to re-
quire lots assessed actually to touch the improvement;
Cohen v. Cleveland, 43 Ohio St. 190, 1 N.E. 589.

## ABUTMENTS

The walls of a bridge adjoining
the land which support the end of the roadway
and sustain the arches. The ends of a bridge,
or those parts of it which touch the land. Board

Cro.Jac. 183.

## ABUTTER

One whose property abuts, is contigu-
ous, or joins at a border or boundary, as where
no other land, road, or street intervenes.

## ABUTTING OWNER

An owner of land which
abuts or adjoins. The term usually implies that
the relative parts actually adjoin, but is some-
times loosely used without implying more than
close proximity. See Abut.
Where five-foot strip between property assessed for pav-
ing and street was conveyed to city but not used for street
purposes, property assessed held not "abutting property,"
Davidson v. Salt Lake City, 81 Utah 203, 17 P.2d 234, 237.
Property owners held "abutting property owners," sub-
ject to sewer assessment, notwithstanding street was wid-
ened from 40 to 50 feet when incorporated in state high-
way, and city bought the extra 5 feet on either side. Ca-
rey-Reed Co. v. Sisco, 251 Ky. 22, 64 S.W.2d 430, 433. Rail-
road in street was not "abutting owner". Town of

## AC ETIAM

(Lat. And also.) The introduction
of the statement of the real cause of action, used
in those cases where it was necessary to allege a

## ACCEDAS AD CURIAM

(Lat. That you go to
court.) An original writ out of chancery directed
to the sheriff, for the purpose of removing a re-
plevin suit from a Court Baron or a hundred court
to one of the superior courts of law. It directs

Fitzh. Nat. Brev. 18; Dy. 169; 3 Bl. Comm. 34.

## ACCEDAS AD VICE COMITEM

L. Lat. (You

"accelerated". Elliott v. Brintlinger, 376 III. 147, 33 N.E.
2d 199, 201, 133 A.L.R. 1364. The word is also used in ref-
erence to contracts for payment of money in what is usual-
ly called an "acceleration clause" by which the time for
payment of the debt is hastened or advanced because of
breach of some condition such as failure to pay interest
when due, McCormick v. Daggett, 162 Ark. 16, 257 S.W.

Co., 99 Or. 533, 194 P. 461, 462. Admit and agree
to; accede to or consent to; receive with approval;
adopt; agree to. Rocha v. Hulen, 6 Cal.App.2d

city engineer's reports. City of Morehead v
Blair, 243 Ky. 84, 47 S.W.2d 741, 742. Means
something more than to receive, meaning t
adopt, to agree to carry out provisions. Assigne
of lease, Pickier v. Mershon, 212 Iowa, 447, 236
N.W. 382, 385; Central State Bank v. Herrick
214 Iowa 379, 240 N.W. 242, 246. Renewal healt
and accident policy premiums, Prescott v. Mutua

## ACCEPTANCE

The taking and receiving o
anything in good part, and as it were a taci
agreement to a preceding act, which might hav
been defeated or avoided if such acceptance ha
not been made. Brooke, Abr. The act of a per
son to whom a thing is offered or tendered by an
other, whereby he receives the thing with the in
tention of retaining it, such intention being evi
denced by a sufficient act. JEtna Inv. Corporatio
v. Chandler Landscape & Floral Co., 227 Mo.App
17, 50 S.W.2d 195, 197.
The exercise of power conferred by an offer b
performance of some act. In re Larney's Estate

due. 4 East 72; Hunt v. Security State Bank, 9
Or. 362, 179 P. 248, 251.
The act by which the person on whom a bill of exchang
is drawn (called the "drawee") assents to the request o
the drawer to pay it, or, in other words, engages, or make
himself liable, to pay it when due. Bell-Wayland Co. v
Bank of Sugden, 95 Okl. 67, 218 P. 705. It may be by par
or in writing, and either general or special, absolute o
conditional; and it may be impliedly, as well as expressly
given. 3 Kent, Comm. 83, 85; Story, Bills, §§ 238, 251
Telegram directing drawer to draw draft. Hoffer v. Eas
land Nat. Bank, Tex.Civ.App., 169 S.W.2d 275, 278. Cer
tification at request of the payee or holder. Welch v. Ban
of Manhattan Co., 35 N.Y.S.2d 894, 895, 264 App.Div. 906
But the usual and regular mode of acceptance is by th
drawee's writing across the face of the bill the word "ac
cepted," and subscribing his name; after which he i
termed the acceptor. Story, Bills, § 243.
Contracts
Compliance by offeree with terms and condi
tions of offer would constitute an "acceptance"
Davis & Clanton v. C. I. T. Corporation, 190 S.C
151, 2 S.E.2d 382, 383.
Qualifications or conditions make a "counteroffer," n
an "acceptance." Cohn v. Penn Beverage Co., 313 Pa
349, 169 A. 768, 769. Bullock v. McKeon, 104 Cal.App. 72
285 P. 392, 395.

curs when insurer agrees to accept application
and to issue policy. Acacia Mut. Life Ass'n v.
Berry, 54 Ariz. 208, 94 P.2d 770, 772. Delay or in-
action on the part of an insurer cannot constitute
an "acceptance". French American Banking Cor-
poration v. Fireman's Fund Ins. Co., D.C.N.Y., 43
F.Supp. 494, 498. More than mere mental resolu-
tion or determination on part of insurer to accept
application. Must be communicated to applicant.
Limbaugh v. Monarch Life Ins. Co., Springfield,
Mass., Mo.App., 84 S.W.2d 208, 212.
Marine Insurance
The acceptance of an abandonment by the un-
derwriter is his assent, either express or to be
implied from the surrounding circumstances, to
the sufficiency and regularity of the abandonment.
Rap. & Law.
Sales
An acceptance implies, not only tha physical
fact of receiving the goods, but also the intention
of retaining them. Illinois Fuel Co. v. Mobile
& 0. R. Co., 319 Mo. 899, 8 S.W.2d 834, 841.
Retaining and using goods. Ohio Electric Co. v. Wis-
consin-Minnesota Light & Power Co., 161 Wis. 632, 155 N.
W. 112, 113. Pressure tanks, Dunck Tank Works v. Suther-
land, 236 Wis. 83, 294 N.W. 510, 513. Coal stokers used
for 15 months before request for removal, United States
v. Lux Laundry Co., C.C.A.Ind., 118 F.2d 848, 849. Where
goods are expressly rejected, receipt does not mean accept-
ance. State Board of Administration v. Roquemore, 218
Ala. 120, 117 So. 757, 760. The acceptance of goods sold
under a contract which would be void by the statute of
frauds without delivery and acceptance involves something
more than the act of the vendor in the delivery. It re-
quires that the vendee should also act, and that his act
should be of such a nature as to indicate that he receives
and accepts the goods delivered as his property. He must
receive and retain the articles delivered, intending there-
by to assume the title to them, to constitute the acceptance
l mentioned in the statute. Rodgers v. Phillips, 40 N.Y.
524. See, also, Snow v. Warner, 10 Mete. (Mass.) 132, 43
Am. Dec. 417. There must be some unequivocal act, with
intent to take possession as owner. Vacuum Ash & Soot
- Conveyor Co. v. Huyler's, 101 N.J.Law, 147, 127 A. 203, 204.
Title and possession must be in unrestricted control of buy-
er so as not to permit of recall or rescission. Mellen Pro-
duce Co. v. Fink, 225 Wis. 90, 273 N.W. 538. Mere words
are insvfficient to establish "delivery and receipt." Mellen
Produce Co. v. Fink, 225 Wis. 90, 273 N.W. 538, 542.
The following are the principal varieties of acceptances :
Absolute. An express and positive agreement to pay the
bill according to its tenor.
Conditional. An engagement to pay the bill on the hap-
pening of a condition. Todd v. Bank of Kentucky, 3 Bush,
(Ky.) 628. A "conditional acceptance" is in effect a state-
ment that the offeree is willing to enter into a bargain
differing in some respects from that proposed in the origi-
nal offer. The conditional acceptance is, therefore, itself a
counter offer. Hoskins v. Michener, 33 Idaho, 681, 197 P.
t 724. Morris F. Fox & Co. v. Lisman, 208 Wis. 1, 237 N.W.
267, 271. Worley v. Holding Corporation, 348 Ill. 420, 181
N.E. 307, 309.
Express. An undertaking in direct and express terms to
pay the bill; an absolute acceptance.
Implied. An undertaking to pay the bill inferred from
acts of the drawee of a character which fairly warrant such
an inference. In case of a bilateral contract, "acceptance"
of an offer need not be expressed, but may be shown by
proposed bargain. Prescott v. Mutual Ben. Health and Ac-
cident Ass' n, 133 Fla. 510, 183 So. 311, 315, 119 A.L.R. 525.
Frederick Raff Co. v. Murphy, 110 Conn. 234, 147 A. 709,
711. Tenant for several months continued to occupy store-
room and paid rentals, C. R. Anthony Co. v. Stroud, 189
Oki. 104, 114 P.2d 177, 178. Landlord's reletting leased
premises after default in rent, In re Lear Shoe Co., Sup.,
22 N.Y.S.2d 778, 782. Taking possession, exercise of owner-
ship and dominion and failure to complain to seller, Bell
v. Main, D.C.Pa., 49 F.Supp. 689, 692.
Partial. An acceptance varying from the tenor of the
bill. An acceptance to pay part of the amount for which
the bill is drawn, 1 Strange 214, or to pay at a different
time, 14 Jur. 806; Hatcher v. Stolworth, 25 Miss. 376;
or at a different place, 4 M. & S. 462, would be partial.
For some examples of what do and what do not constitute
conditional acceptances, see Heaverin v. Donnell, 7 Smedes
& M. (Miss.) 245, 45 Am.Dec. 302; Campbell v. Pettengill, 7
Greenl. (Me.) 126, 20 Am.Dec. 349; Ensign v. Clark Bros.
Cutlery Co., 195 Mo.App. 584, 193 S. W. 961, 962. Provi-
sions respecting cutting of timber etc. on optioned land, did
not destroy the "acceptance". Bastian v. United States, C.
C.A.Ohio, 118 F.2d 777, 779. Would be in named place for
purpose of entering into option, Ackerman v. Carpenter,
113 Vt. 77, 29 A.2d 922, 925. Counter proposition to option.
Tholl Oil Co. v. Miller, 197 La. 976, 3 So.2d 97, 98. Con-
ditional, qualified acceptance, Moore Bros. v. Kirkpatrick,
Tex.Civ.App., 172 S.W.2d 135, 137.
Qualified. One either conditional or partial, and which
introduces a variation in the sum, time, mode, or place of
payment.
Supra protest. An acceptance by a third person, after
protest of the bill for non-acceptance by the drawee, to
save the honor of the drawer or some particular indorser.
A. general acceptance is an absolute acceptance precisely
in conformity with the tenor of the bill itself, and not
qualified by any statement, condition, or change. Todd v.
Bank of Kentucky, 3 Bush (Ky.) 628. A special acceptance
is the qualified acceptance of a bill of exchange, as where
it is accepted as payable at a particular place "and not
elsewhere." Rowe v. Young, 2 Brod. & B. 180. See Trade
Acceptance.

## ACCEPTANCE AU BESOIN

Fr, In French
law. Acceptance in case of need; an acceptance
by one on whom a bill is drawn au besoin, that is,
in case of refusal or failure of the drawee to ac-
cept. Story, Bills, §§ 65, 254, 255.
ACCEPTARE,
Civil Law
Lat. To accept; to assent; to assent to a prom-
ise made by another. Gro. de J. B. lib. 2, c. 11,
§ 14.
Pleading
To accept. Acceptavit, he accepted. 2 Strange,
817. Non acceptavit, he did not accept. 4 Man. &
G. 7.

## ACCEPTEUR PAR INTERVENTION

In French
law. Acceptor of a bill for honor.

## ACCEPTILATION

In the civil and Scotch law.
A release made by a creditor to his debtor of his
debt, without receiving any consideration. Ayl.
Pand. tit. 26, p. 570. It is a species of donation,
but not subject to the forms of the latter, and is
valid unless in fraud of creditors. Merl. Repert.
The verbal extinction of a verbal contract, with
a declaration that the debt has been paid when it
has not; or the acceptance of something merely
imaginary in satisfaction of a verbal contract.

## ACCEPTOR

The person who accepts a bill of
exchange, (generally the drawee,) or who engages
to be primarily responsible for its payment. Nis-
senbaum v. State, 38 Ga.App. 253, 143 S.E. 776, 777.

## ACCEPTOR SUPRA PROTEST

One who ac-
cepts a bill which has been protested, for the hon-
or of the drawer or any one of the indorsers.

## ACCESS

Approach; or the means, power, or
opportunity of approaching. Sometimes import-
ing the occurrence of sexual intercourse, Jackson
v. Jackson, 182 Okl. 74, 76 P.2d 1062, 1066; other-
wise as importing opportunity of communication
for that purpose as between husband and wife.
In real property law, the term "access" denotes the
right vested in the owner of land which adjoins a road or
other highway to go and return from his own land to the
highway without obstruction. Cobb v. Commissioners of
Lincoln Park, 202 Ill. 427, 67 N.E. 5, G, 8. "Access" to
property does not necessarily carry with it possession.
People v. Brenneauer, 166 N.Y.S. 801, 806, 101 Misc. 156.
A deed, however, which conveys land and "also the right
of access to the adjoining park and use of spring on same,"
may be deemed to convey not merely the right to pass
through the park in order to reach the spring, but to con-
vey a right of entry into the pail( as a park and by im-
plication, the right to the use and enjoyment of the park.
Goetz v. Knoxville Power & Light Co., 154 Tenn. 545, 290
S. W. 409, 414.
The right of "access" as applied to a private wharf on
public lands merely means that there may not be built an
obstruction separating the lands from the navigable high-
way. City of Oakland v. Hogan, 41 Cal.App.2d 333, 106 P.
2d 987, 995.
The right of "access to public records" includes not
only a legal right of access but a reasonable opportunity to
avail oneself of the same. American Surety Co. of New
York v. Sandberg, D.C.Wash., 225 F. 150, 155.
Canon Law
The right to some benefice at some future time.

## ACCESS (EASEMENT OF)

An "easement of ac-
cess" is the right which an abutting owner has of
ingress to and egress from his premises, in addi-
tion to the public easement in the street. State
Highway Board v. Baxter, 167 Ga. 124, 144 S.E.
796, 800; Lang v. Smith, 113 Pa.Super. 559, 173
A. 682, 683. "Access to an underground sewer"
means more than a right to open the surface to
make repairs, and implies the right of connection
by branches. Heyman v. Biggs, 150 N.Y.S. 246,
247, 164 App.Div. 430.

## ACCESSARY

See Accessory.

## ACCESSIO

In Roman law. An increase or ad-
dition; that which lies next to a thing, and is
supplementary and necessary to the principal
thing; that which arises or is produced from the
principal thing; an "accessory obligation" (q. v.).
Calvinus, Lex. Jurid.
One of the modes of acquiring property, being
the extension of ownership over that which grows
from, or is united to, an article which one already
possesses. Mather v. Chapman, 40 Conn. 382,
397, 16 Am.Rep. 46.
Accessio includes both accession and accretion
The right to all which one's own property produces,
whether that property be movable or immovable; and the
right to that which is united to it by accession, either na-
turally or artificially. 2 Kent, 360; 2 Bl.Comm. 404;
Franklin Service Stations v. Sterling Motor Truck Co. of
N. E., 50 R. I. 336, 147 A. 754, 755.
Riparian owners' right to abandoned river beds and
rights of alluvion by accretion and reliction, Manry v.
Robison, 122 Tex. 213, 56 S.W.2d 438, 443, 444.
A principle derived from the civil law, by which the
owner of property becomes entitled to all which it pro-
duces, and to all that is added or united to it, either natu-
rally or artificially, (that is, by the labor or skill of anoth-
er.) even where such addition extends to a change of form
or materials; and by which, on the other hand, the pos-
sessor of property becomes entitled to it, as against the
original owner, where the addition made to it by his skill
and labor is of greater value than the property itself, or
where the change effected in its form is so great as to
render it impossible to restore it to its original shape.
Twin City Motor Co. v. Rouzer Motor Co., 197 N.C. 371, 148
S.E. 461, 463. In Blackwood Tire & Vulcanizing Co. v.
Auto Storage Co., 133 Tenn. 515, 182 S. W. 576, L.R.A.1916E,
254, Ann.Cas.1917C, 1168, this principle was applied in favor
of the conditional seller who, on nonpayment, retook the
automobile sold, together with tire casings which the buy-
er had fitted thereto. Valley Chevrolet Co. v. 0. S. Stapley
Co., 50 Ariz. 417, 72 P.2d 945.
International Law
The absolute or conditional acceptance by one
or several states of a treaty already concluded be-
tween other sovereignties. Merl. Rêpert. It may
be of two kinds: First, the formal entrance of a
third state into a treaty so that such state be-
comes a party to it; and this can only be with
the consent of the original parties. Second, a
state may accede to a treaty between other states
solely for the purpose of guarantee, in which case,
though a party, it is affected by the treaty only as
a guarantor. 1 Oppenheim, Int.L. sec. 532. See
Adhesion.
Also, the commencement or inauguration of a
sovereign's reign.

## ACCESSION, DEED OF

In Scotch law. A deed
executed by the creditors of a bankrupt or insol-
vent debtor, by which they approve of a trust giv-
en by their debtor for the general behoof, and
bind themselves to concur in the plans proposed
for extricating his affairs. Bell, Diet.
ACCESSORIUM NON DUCIT, SED SEQUITUR
SUUM PRINCIPALE, Co. Litt. 152a, 389a. That
which is the accessory or incident does not lead,
but follows, its principal.

## ACCESSORIUS SEQUITUR NATURAM SUI PRINCIPALIS

An accessary follows the nature
of his principal. 3 Inst. 139. One who is acces-
sary to a crime cannot be guilty of a higher de-
gree of crime than his principal.

## ACCESSORY

Anything which is joined to anoth-
er thing as an ornament, or to render it more
perfect, or which accompanies it, or is connected
with it, as an incident, or as subordinate to it, or
which belongs to or with it; for example, the
Adjunct or accompaniment. Louis Werner Saw
Mill Co. v. White, 205 La. 242, 17 So.2d 264, 270.
A sale of land carried with it the standing timber as an
"accessory." Woollums v. Hewitt, 142 La. 597, 77 So. 295,
Automobile Accessories
Articles primarily adapted for use in motor ve-
hicles, under revenue acts. Universal Battery Co.
v. U. S., Ct.C1., 50 S.Ct. 422, 423, 281 U.S. 580, 74
L.Ed. 1051.
Criminal Law
Contributing to or aiding in the commission of
a crime. One who, without being present at the
commission of a felonious offense, becomes guilty
of such offense, not as a chief actor, but as a par-
ticipator, as by command, advice, instigation, or
concealment; either before or after the fact or
commission; a particeps criminis. 4 Bl.Comm.
35; Cowell.
One who is not the chief actor in the offense, nor pres-
ent at its perfornlance. but in some way concerned therein,
either before or after the act committed. State v. Thomas,
136 A. 475, 477, 105 Conn. 757. One who aids and abets
another. People v. Smith, 260 N.W. 911, 271 Mich. 553.
Commands or counsels another. United States v. Peoni,
C.C.A.N.Y., 100 F.2d 401, 402.
An "accessory" to a crime is always an "accomplice."
People v. Ah Gee, 37 Cal.App. 1, 174 P. 371, 373. In certain
crimes, there can be no accessories; all who are concerned
are principals. These are (according to many authorities)
treason, and all offenses below the degree of felony: 4
Bla.Comm. 35; Com. v. McAtee, 8 Dana (Ky.) 28; Wil-
liams v. State, 12 Smedes & M. (Miss.) 58.
Accessory Before the Fact
One who, being absent at the time a crime is
committed, yet assists, procures, counsels, incites,
induces, encourages, engages, or commands anoth-
er to commit it. 4 Steph, Comm. 90, note n.
People v. Owen, 241 Mich. 111, 216 N.W. 434.
United States v. Pritchard, D.C.S.C., 55 F.Supp.
201, .203; rape, Clayton v. State, 244 Ala. 10, 13
So.2d 420, 422.
Murder, Wells v. State, 94 Ga. 70, 20 S.E.2d 580,
582. Distilling, State v. Lackmann, Mo., 12 S.W.
2d 424, 425.
Accessory During the Fact
One who stands by without interfering or giv-
ing such help as may be in his power to prevent
the commission of a criminal offense. Farrell v.
People, 8 Colo.App. 524, 46 P. 841.
Accessory After the Fact
One who, having full knowledge that a crime
has been committed, conceals it from the magis-
trate, and harbors, assists, or protects the person
charged with, or convicted of, the crime. Ver-
non's Ann.C.C.P. art. 53.
All persons who, after the commission of any
felony, conceal or aid the offender, with knowl-
edge that he has committed a felony, and with in-
tent that he may avoid or escape from arrest,
trial, conviction, or punishment, are accessories.
An accessory after the fact is a person who, knowing a
felony to have been committed by another, receives, re-
lieves, comforts or assists the felon, in order to enable him
to escape from punishment, or the like. Buck v. Common-
wealth, 116 Va. 1031, 83 S.E. 390, 393. Knowledge, or de-
nial of knowledge, of perpetration of crime, or silence
does not make one an "accessory after the fact." Com-
monwealth v. Giacobbe, 341 Pa. 187, 19 A.2d 71, 75. Cantu
v. State, 135 S.W.2d 705, 710, 141 Tex.Cr.R. 99. But af-
firmative action by false testimony or otherwise usable by
accused to escape punishment constitutes one "accessory"
as to his testimony. Fisher v. State, 34 S.W.2d 293, 294,
117 Tex.Cr.R. 552; false statements to sheriff relative to
defendant's connection with homicide in order to evade
arrest, Littles v. State, 111 Tex.Cr.R. 500, 14 S.W.2d 853,
Aiders and Abettors Distinguished
The concept of an "accessory before the fact"
presupposes a prearrangement to do the criminal
act, and to constitute one an "alder and abettor"
he must be on the ground and by his presence
aid, encourage or incite the principal. Morel v.
United States, C.C.A.Ohio, 127 F.2d 827, 830, 831.
Principal Distinguished
"Principal in the second degree," as distin-
guished from "accessory before the fact," is one
who aids in commission of felony by being either
actually or constructively present, aiding, and
abetting commission of felony, when perpetrated.
Neumann v. State, 116 Fla. 98, 156 So. 237, 239.

## ACCESSORY ACTION

In Scotch practice. An
action which is subservient or auxiliary to anoth-
er. Of this kind are actions of "proving the ten-
or," by which lost deeds are restored; and actions
of "transumpts," by which copies of principal
deeds are certified. Bell, Dict.

## ACCESSORY CONTRACT

In the civil law. A
contract which is incident or auxiliary to another
or principal contract; such as the engagement of
a surety. Poth. Obl. pt. 1, c. 1, § 1, art. 2.
A principal contract is one entered into by both parties
,on their own accounts, or in the several qualities they as-
sume. An accessory contract is made for assuring the per-
formance of a prior contract, either by the same parties or
by others; such as suretyship, mortgage, and pledge.
Blaisdell v. Coe, 83 N.H. 167, 139 A. 758, 65 A.L.R. 626.
ACCESSORY OBLIGATION.
Civil Law
An obligation which is incident to another or
principal obligation; the obligation of a surety.
Poth. Obl. pt. 2, c. 1, § 6.
Scotch Law
Obligations to antecedent or primary obliga-
tions, such as obligations to pay interest, etc.
Ersk. Inst. lib. 3, tit. 3, § 60.
See, further, Obligation.

## ACCESSORY TO ADULTERY

Implies more
than connivance, which is merely knowledge with
consent. A conniver abstains from interference;
cures the adultery. 20 & 21 Vict. c. 85, §§ 29, 31.

## ACCIDENT

The word "accident" is derived
from the Latin verb "accidere" signifying "fall
upon, befall, happen, chance." In an etymological
sense anything that happens may be said to be
an accident and in this sense, the word has been
defined as befalling; a change; a happening; an
incident; an occurrence or event. In its most
commonly accepted meaning, or in its ordinary or
popular sense, the word may be defined as mean-
ing a fortuitous circumstance, event, or happen-
ing, an event happening without any human
agency, or if happening wholly or partly through
human agency, an event which under the circum-
stances is unusual and unexpected by the person
to whom it happens; an unusual, fortuitous, un-
expected, unforeseen or unlooked for event, hap-
pening or occurrence; an unusual or unexpected
result attending the operation or performance of
a usual or necessary act or event; chance or
contingency; fortune; mishap; some sudden and
unexpected event taking place without expectation,
upon the instant, rather than something which
continues, progresses or develops; something
happening by chance; something unforeseen, un-
expected, unusual, extraordinary or phenominal,
taking place not according to the usual course of
things or events, out of the range of ordinary
calculations; that which exists or occurs abnor-
mally, or an uncommon occurrence; the word
may be employed as denoting a calamity, casual-
ty, catastrophe, disaster, an undesirable or unfor-
tunate happening; any unexpected personal in-
jury resulting from any unlooked for mishap or
occurrence; any unpleasant or unfortunate oc-
currence, that causes injury, loss, suffering or
death; some untoward occurrence aside from the
usual course of events. Adams v. Metropolitan
Life Ins. Co., 136 Pa.Super. 454, 7 A.2d 544, 547;
without known or assignable cause, Ramsay v.

ed by the use of that kind and degree of care necessary to
the exigency and in the circumstances in which he was

fenstein v. Union Traction Co., 112 Kan. 770, 212 P. 1097,

tive the idea of negligence on the part of the person whose
physical act caused the occurrence. Campbell v. Jones, 73

tract called mandatum, by which the owner of the proper-
ty gives the master power to dispose of it; and the con-
tract of partnership, in virtue of which the profits are to be
divided between them. One party runs the risk of losing
his capital; the other, his labor. If the sale produces no
more than first cost, the owner takes all the proceeds. It
is only the profits which are to be divided. Emerig.Mar.

sideration. William D. Seymour & Co. v. Castell,
160 La. 371, 107 So. 143, 145.
"While a party's intent may be to aid a maker of note
by lending his credit, if he seeks to accomplish thereby
legitimate objects of his own, and not simply to aid maker,
the act is not for 'accommodation.' " Bazer v. Grimmett,

crime charged, either by being present and aiding or abet-
ting in it, or having advised and encouraged it, though
absent from place when it was committed, though mere
presence, acquiescence, or silence, in the absence of a duty
to act, is not enough, no matter how reprehensible it may
be, to constitute one an accomplice. State v. Arnold, 84
Mont. 348. 275 P. 757, 760; presence unnecessary. King
v. State. 135 Tex.Cr.11. 378, 120 S.W.2d 590, 592. Knowl-

As specifically applied to witnesses for the state and the

omission either before, at the time of, or after the com-

191 Wash. 477, 71 P.2d 559, 564. An agreement to

ing and the party injured, in view of the original obliga-
tion. Barbarich v. Chicago, M., St. P. & P. Ry. Co., 92
Mont. 1, 9 P.2d 797, 799.
It may arise both where the demand itself is unliqui-
dated or in dispute, and where the amount and nature of
the demand is undisputed, and it is agreed to give and take
less than the demand. J. F. Morgan Paving Co. v. Carroll,
211 Ala. 121, 99 So. 640, 641.
"Payment," as distinguished from accord, means full
satisfaction. State v. Tyler County State Bank, Tex.Com.
App., 277 S. W. 625, 627, 42 A.L.R. 1347.
See Accord and Satisfaction; Compromise and
Settlement.

## ACCORD

In practice. To agree or concur,
as one judge with another. "I accord." Eyre,
C. J., 12 Mod. 7. "The rest accorded." 7 Mod.

## ACCORD AND SATISFACTION

An agreement
between two persons, one of whom has a right of
action against the other, that the latter should do
or give, and the former accept, something in sat-
isfaction of the right of action different from, and
usually less than, what might be legally enforced.
When the agreement is executed, and satisfaction
has been made, it is called "accord and satisfac-
tion." Rogers v. Spokane, 9 Wash. 168, 37 P. 300.
It is discharge of contract, or of disputed claim arising
either from contract or from tort, by substitution of agree-
ment between parties in satisfaction of such contract or
disputed claim and execution of the agreement. Nelson v.
Chicago Mill & Lumber Corporation, C.C.A.Ark., 76 F.2d
17, 100 A.L.R. 87.
"Accord and satisfaction" results where there is assent
to acceptance of payment in compromise of dispute, or in
extinguishment of liability uncertain in amount, or where
payment, coupled with condition whereby use of money
will be wrongful if condition is ignored, is accepted. Hud-
son v. Yonkers Fruit Co., 258 N.Y. 168, 179 N.E. 373.
Regardless of whether claim is liquidated or unliquidated.
May Bros. v. Doggett, 155 Miss. 849, 124 So. 476, 478.

v. New York Life Ins. Co., 307 Mich. 125, 11 N.W.2d 830,

value of policies. Greenberg v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.,
379 Ill. 421, 41 N.E.2d 495, 497, 140 A.L.R. 775.
See, also, Sierra & San Francisco Power Co. v. Uni-
versal Electric & Gas Co., 197 Cal. 376, 241 P. 76, 80.
More recently, a broader application of the doctrine has
been made, where one promise or agreement is set up in
satisfaction of another. Continental Nat. Bank v. Mc-
Geoch, 92 Wis. 286, 66 N.W. 606.
An "accord and satisfaction arises" where parties, by a
subsequent agreement, have satisfied the former one, and
the latter agreement has been executed. The execution
of a new agreement may itself amount to a satisfaction,
where it is so expressly agreed by the parties ; and with-
out such agreement, if the new promise is founded on a
new consideration, in which case the taking of the new
consideration amounts to the satisfaction of the former
contract.
A dispute or controversy is not an essential element of
some forms of accord and satisfaction, as an accord and
satisfaction of a liquidated claim by the giving and accept-
ance of a smaller sum and some additional consideration,
such as new security, payment of the debt before due,
payment by a third person, or where property or personal
services are accepted from an insolvent debtor in satis-
faction. Burgamy v. Holton, 165 Ga. 384, 141 S.E. 42, 47.
"Composition settlement" contemplates agreement not
only between debtor and creditors, but also among credi-
tors, whereas "accord and satisfaction" is agreement
between debtor and single creditor. Russell v. Douget,
La.App., 171 So. 501, 502.
"Novation" is a species of "accord and satisfaction".
Munn v. Town of Drakesville, 226 Iowa 1040, 285 N.W. 644,
See Acceptance; Composition; Compromise;
Novation.

## ACCORDANCE

cord; conformity. Webster, Dict.; City and
County of San Francisco v. Boyd, 22 Cal.2d 685,
140 P.2d 666, 668.
An act done .in accordance with a purpose once formed
is not necessarily an act done in pursuance of such pur-
pose, for the purpose may have been abandoned before the
act was done. State v. Robinson, 20 W.Va. 713, 742. A
charter providing that a city's power of taxation shall be

## ACCOUNT

A detailed statement of the mutual
demands in the nature of debt and credit between
parties, arising out of contracts or some fiduciary
relation. Portsmouth v. Donaldson, 32 Pa. 202, 72
Am.Dec. 782.
A statement in writing, of debts and credits, or
of receipts and payments; a list of items of debts
and credits, with their respective dates. Rens-
selaer Glass Factory v. Reid, 5 Cow., N.Y., 593.
An "account" is defined as a statement of pecuniary
transactions; a record or course of business dealings
between parties ; a list or statement of monetary transac-
tions, such as payments, losses, sales, debits, credits, etc.,
in most cases showing a balance or result of comparison
between items of an opposite nature; and is not held to
include a liability for unliquidated damages resulting
from the breach of an entire contract, expressing only
an entire consideration. Harnischfeger Sales Corporation
v. Pickering Lumber Co., C.C.A.Mo., 97 F.2d 692, 695.
The word is sometimes used to denote the balance, or
the right of action for the balance, appearing due upon a
statement of dealings ; as where one speaks of an assign-
ment of accounts ; but there is a broad distinction between
an account and the mere balance of an account, resembling
the distinction in logic between the premises of an argu-
ment and the conclusions drawn therefrom. A balance is
but the conclusion or result of the debit and credit sides
of an account. It implies mutual dealings, and the exist-
ence of debt and credit, without which there could be no
balance. McWilliams v. Allan, 45 Mo. 574.
A generic term, difficult to define, having various mean-
ings, depending somewhat upon the surrounding circum-
stances and the connection in which it is used. Wolcott
& Lincoln v. Butler, 155 Kan. 105, 122 P.2d 720, 722, 141
A. L. R. 356.

open for adjustment and set-off, which distinguish-
es it from an account stated. Mandeville v. Wil-
son, 5 Cranch 15, 3 L.Ed. 23.
Current
An open or running or unsettled account be-
tween two parties; the antithesis of an account
stated. See Watson v. Gillespie, 200 N.Y.S. 191,
198, 205 App.Div. 613; Caffarelli Bros. v. Lyons
Bros. Co., Tex.Civ.App., 199 S.W. 685, 686; Con-

a voluntary settlement in which the settlor had a
life-interest.
Mutual
Accounts comprising mutual credits between
the parties; or an existing credit on one side
which constitutes a ground for credit on the other,
or where there is an understanding that mutual

between the parties. McConnell v. Arkansas Cof-
fin Co., 172 Ark. 87, 287 S.W. 1007.
Open
An account which has not been finally settled
or closed, but is still running or open to future ad-
justment or liquidation. Open account, in legal
as well as in ordinary language, means an indebt-
edness subject to future adjustment, and which
may be reduced or modified by proof. James v.
Lederer-Strauss & Co., 32 Wyo. 377, 233 P. 137,
An open account can become an account stated only by
the debtor's admission of liability, or failure to deny lia-
bility for a reasonable time after receipt of account.

Ariz. 394, 226 P. 206, 208. An account stated is not ordi-
narily recognized in Virginia and West Virginia, except
as between merchant and merchant, and principal and
agent, with mutual accounts. Price Hill Colliery Co. v.
Pinkney, 96 W.Va. 74, 122 S.E. 434, 436. This was also a
common count in a declaration upon a contract under
which the plaintiff might prove an absolute acknowledg-
ment by the defendant of a liquidated demand of a fixed
amount, which implies a promise to pay on request. It
might be joined with any other count for a money demand.
The acknowledgment or admission must have been made
to the plaintiff or his agent. Wharton.
ACCOUNT, or ACCOUNT RENDER. In prac-
tice. "Account," sometimes called "account ren-
der," was a form of action at common law against
a person who by reason of some fiduciary relation
(as guardian, bailiff, receiver, etc.) was bound to
render an account to another, but refused to do so.
Portsmouth v. Donaldson, 32 Pa. 202, 72 Am.Dec.
782; Peoples Finance & Thrift Co. of Visalia v.
Bowman, 137 P.2d 729, 731, .58 Cal.App.2d 729.
"Action of account" is common-law action to compel
person to render account for property or money of another.
Dahlberg v. Fisse, 328 Mo. 213, 40 S.W.2d 606, 609. Equita-
ble in nature. Gaines Bros. Co. v. Gaines, 188 Okl. 300,
108 P.2d 177, 179.
In England, this action early fell into disuse; and as it is
one of the most dilatory and expensive actions known to
the law, and the parties are held to the ancient rules of
pleading, and no discovery can be obtained, it never was
adopted to any great extent in the United States. But in
some states this action was employed, chiefly because there
were no chancery courts in which a bill for an accounting
would lie. The action is peculiar in the fact that two
judgments are rendered, a preliminary judgment that the
defendant do account with the plaintiff (quod computet)
and a final judgment (quod recuperet) after the account-
ing for the balance found due. Field v. Brown, 146 Ind.
293, 45 N.E. 464, 16 Blatchf. 178.

leaves of account book in which they are contained. W. T.

## ACCOUNT COMPUTATIO

The primary idea of
"account computatio", whether in proceedings of
courts of law or equity, is some matter of debt

person entitled thereto. U. S. v. Rehwald, D.C.

Accretion of land is of two kinds : By alluvion, 1. e., by

or by dereliction, as when the sea shrinks below the usual

When an executor or other trustee masses the rents,

S.E. 60, 62.
ACCUSATOR POST RATIONABILE TEMPUS

W. 548.
In its popular sense "accusation" applies to all deroga
tory charges or imputations, whether or not they relate to
a punishable legal offense, and however made, whethe
orally, by newspaper, or otherwise. People v. Braman, 3
Mich. 460. But in legal phraseology, it is limited to suc

Gratt. (Va.) 629.

## ACQUAINTED

Having personal knowledge of.
Kelly v. Calhoun, 95 U.S. 710, 24 L.Ed. 544. Ac-
quaintance expresses less than familiarity; In re
Carpenter's Estate, 94 Cal. 406, 29 P. 1101. It is
"familiar knowledge"; Wyllis v. Haun, 47 Iowa,
614; Chauvin v. Wagner, 18 Mo. 531.
"Acquaintance" expresses less than familiarity; famili-
arity less than intimacy. Acquaintance springs from oc-
casional intercourse, familiarity from daily intercourse,
intimacy from unreserved intercourse; acquaintance, hav-
ing some knowledge, familiarity, from long habit, inti-
macy, by close connection. Atkins Corporation v. Tourny,
6 Ca1.2d 206, 57 P.2d 480, 483. To be "personally
acquainted with," and to "know personally," are equiva-
lent terms; Kelly v. Calhoun, 95 U.S. 710, 24 L.Ed. 544.

estates which they may acquire during the marriage,
either by donations made jointly to them both, or by pur-
chase, or in any other similar way, even though the pur-
chase be only in the name of one of the two, and not of
both. See Community; Conquéts.

## ACQUIESCE

To give an implied consent to a
transaction, to the accrual of a right, or to any
act, by one's mere silence, or without express
assent or acknowledgment., Scott v. Jackson, 89
Cal. 258, 26 P. 898.

## ACQUIESCENCE

Conduct recognizing the ex-
istence of a transaction, and intended, in some
extent at least, to carry the transaction, or permit
it to be carried, into effect; it is some act, not
deliberately intended to ratify a former transac-
tion known to be voidable, but recognizing the
transaction as existing, and intended, in some ex-
tent at least, to carry it into effect, and to obtain
or claim the benefits resulting from it, and thus
differs from "confirmation," which implies a de-
liberate act, intended to renew and ratify a trans-
action known to be voidable. De Boe v. Prentice
Packing & Storage Co., 172 Wash. 514, 20 P.2d
1107, 1110.
Passive compliance or satisfaction ; distinguished from
avowed consent on the one hand, and, on the other, from

ing Co., 142 Kan. 816, 52 P.2d 379, 387. Acquiescence from
which assent: may be reasonably inferred. Frank v. Wilson
& Co., 24 Del.Ch. 237, 9 A.2d 82, 86. Equivalent to assent
inferred from silence with knowledge or from encourage-
ment and presupposes knowledge and assent. Andrew v.
Rivers, 207 Iowa 343, 223 N.W. 102, 105. Imports tacit con-
sent, concurrence, acceptance or assent. Natural Soda
Products Co. v. City of Los Angeles, Cal.App., 132 P.2d
553, 563. A silent appearance of consent. Worcester,
Diet. Darnell v. Bidwell, 115 Me. 227, 98 A. 743, 745, 5 A.L.
R. 1320. Failure to make any objections. Scott v. Jackson,
89 Cal. 258, 26 P. 898. Submission to an act of which one
had knowledge. See Pence v. Langdon, 99 U.S. 578, 25
L.Ed. 420. It imports full knowledge. Rabe v. Dunlap,
51 N.J.Eq. 40, 25 A. 959. Knowledge without objection.
Indiana Harbor Belt R. Co. v. Jones, 220 Ind. 139, 41
N.E.2d 361, 363.
It is to be distinguished from avowed consent, on the
one hand, and from open discontent or opposition, on the
other.
It arises where a person who knows that he is entitled
to impeach a transaction or enforce a right neglects to do
so for such a length of time that, under the circumstances
of the case, the other party may fairly infer that he has
waived or abandoned his right. Norfolk & W. R. Co. v.
Perdue, 40 W.Va. 442, 21 S.E. 755.
Acquiescence and laches are cognate but not equivalent
terms. The former is a submission to, or resting satisfied
with, an existing state of things, while laches implies a
neglect to do that which the party ought to do for his own
benefit or protection. Hence laches may be evidence of
acquiescence. Laches Imports a merely passive assent,
while acquiescence implies active assent. In re Wilbur's
Estate, 334 Pa. 45, 5 A.2d 325, 331. "Acquiescence" relates
to inaction during performance of an act while "inches"
relates to delay after act is done. Bay Newfoundland Co.
v. Wilson & Co., 24 Del.Ch. 30, 4 A.2d 668, 671, 673. "Acqui-
escence" is synonymous with "abandonment" ; Sclawr v.
City of St. Paul, 132 Minn. 238, 156 N.W. 283, 284, and is
distinguished from "admission" ; Saunders v. Busch-
Everett Co., 138 La. 1049, 71 So. 153, 154; and from "ratifi-
cation" and "estoppel in pais" ; Marion Say. Bank v.
Leahy, 200 Iowa 220, 204 N.W. 456, 458; but see Murray v.
Smith, 152 N.Y:S. 102, 108, 166 App.Div. 528; differs from
"confirmation", in that confirmation implies a deliberate
act, intended to renew and ratify a transaction known to
be voidable, Bauer v. Dotterer, 202 Ark. 1055, 155 S.W.2d
54, 57. A form of "equitable estoppel", Schmitt v. Wright,
317 Ill.App. 384, 46 N.E.2d 184, 192.
See Admission; Confession; Ratification,
ACQUIESCENCE, ESTOPPEL BY. Acquiescence
is a species of estoppel. Bankers' Trust Co. v.
Rood, 211 Iowa, 289, 233 N.W. 794, 802, 73 A.L.R.
An estoppel arises where party aware of his rights sees
other party acting upon mistaken notion of his rights.
Minear v. Keith Furnace Co., Iowa, 239 N.W. 584, 587.
Injury accruing from one's acquiescence in another's action
to his prejudice creates "estoppel". Lebold v. Inland
Steel Co., C.C.A.I11., 125 F.2d 369, 375; Passive conduct on
the part of one who has knowledge of the facts may be
basis of estoppel. Winslow v. Burns, 47 N.M. 29, 132 P.2d
1048, 1050.
It must appear that party to be estopped was bound in
equity and good conscience to speak and that party claim-
ing estoppel relied upon acquiescence and was misled
thereby to change his position to his prejudice. Sherlock
v. Greaves, 106 Mont. 206, 76 P.2d 87, 91.
Acquiescence in a judgment in order to constitute an
estoppel must be unqualified. Messer v. Henlein, 72 N.D.
63, 4 N.W.2d 587, 589. One who stands by while his
property is sold is "estopped" from setting up title against
purchaser. Meadows v. Hampton Live Stock Commission
Co., 55 Cal.App.2d 634, 131 P.2d 591, 592, 593.
The doctrine is applicable only where there is some ele-
ment of turpitude or neglect. City of Lafayette v. Keen,
113 Ind. App. 552, 48 N.E.2d 63, 70.

thing which may be already in existence, or may be
brought into existence through means employed to acquire
it. Ronnow v. City of Las Vegas, 57 Nev. 332, 65 P.2d 133,
140. Sometimes used in the sense of "procure," Jolly v.
McCoy, 36 Cal.App. 479, 172 P. 618, 619. It does not nec-
essarily mean that title has passed, Godwin v. Tuttle, 70
Or. 424, 141 P. 1120, 1122. Includes taking by devise, U. S.
v. Merriam, 263 U.S. 179. 44 S.Ct. 69, 70 68 L.Ed. 240, 29
A. L. R. 1547.

Hartigan v. City of Los Angeles, 170 Cal. 313,
149 P. 590, 592. Taking with, or against, consent.
Scribner v. Wikstrom, 93 N.H. 17, 34 A.2d 658,
660. Especially a material possession obtained by
any means. Jones v. State, 126 Tex.Cr.R. 469, 72
S.W.2d 260, 263.
Original acquisition is that by which a man secures a
property in a thing which is not at the time he acquires
it, and in its then existing condition, the property of any
other individual. It may result from occupancy; 2 Kent,
289; accession; 2 Kent, 293; intellectual labor—namely,
for inventions, which are secured by patent rights; and
for the authorship of books, maps, and charts, which is
protected by copyrights; 1 Bouv.Inst. 508, n.

## ACQUITMENT

See Absolution,

Contracts
A release, absolution, or discharge from an ob-
ligation, liability, or engagement.
According to Lord Coke, there are three kinds of acquit-
tal, namely : by deed, when the party releases the obliga-
tion; by prescription; by tenure; Co. Litt. 100 a.
Crimes
The legal and formal certification of the inno-
cence of a person who has been charged with
crime; a deliverance or setting free a person
from a charge of guilt.
In a narrow sense, it is the absolution of a party accused
on a trial before a traverse jury. Thomas v. De Graf-
fenreid, 2 Nott & McC. (S. C.) 143. Properly speaking,
however, one is not acquitted by the jury but by the judg-
ment of the court. People v. Rogers, 170 N.Y.S. 86, 87,
102 Misc. 437. And he may be legally acquitted by a judg-
ment rendered otherwise than in pursuance of a verdict,
as where he is discharged by a magistrate because of the
insufficiency of the evidence, or the indictment is dismissed
by the court or a nol. pros. entered. State v. Hart, 90 N.J.
Law 261, 101 A. 278. But. compare State v. Smith, 170 N.C.
742; 87 S.E. 98, 99.
"Nol. pros." not equivalent of "acquittal." Bolton v.
State, 166 Miss. 290, 146 So. 453, 454. The unnecessary dis-
charge of the jury without the consent of the accused after
it has been sworn may constitute an acquittal. Riley v.
Commonwealth, 190 Ky. 204, 227 S. W. 146, 147. Acquittal
discharges from guilt, pardon only from punishment.
Younger v. State, 2 W.Va. 579, 98 Am.Dec. 791.
It may occur even though the question of guilt or inno-
cence has never been submitted to a jury, as where a
defendant, having been held under an indictment or infor-
mation, is discharged because not brought to trial within
the time provided by the Criminal Code. State v. Taylor,
130 Kan. 813, 288 P. 731, 732.
Acquittals in fact are those which take place when the
jury, upon trial, finds a verdict of not guilty.
Acquittals in law are those which take place by mere
operation of law; as where a man has been charged
merely as an assessory, and the principal has been acquit-
ted. 2 Co.Inst. 364. Ccmpare State v. Walton, 186 N.C.
485, 119 S.E. 886, 888.
See Jeopardy; Autrefois Acquit; Convict.

The obligation on the part of a mesne lord to
protect his tenant from any claims, entries or
molestations by lords paramount arising out of
the services due to them by the mesne lord. See
Co.Litt. 100a.
one is freed from an obligation to pay money or
perform a duty. It differs from a release in not
requiring to be under seal. Pothier, Oblig. n. 781.
See Milliken v. Brown, 1 Rawle (Pa.) 391.
This word, though perhaps not strictly speaking synon-
ymous with "receipt," includes it. A receipt is one form
of an acquittance; a discharge is another. A receipt in
full is an acquittance, and a receipt for a part of a demand
or obligation is an acquittance pro tanto. State v. Shel-
ters, 51 Vt. 104, 31 Am.Rep. 679.

## ACQUITTED

Released; absolved; purged of an
accusation; judicially discharged from accusation;
released from debt, etc. Includes both civil and
criminal prosecutions. Dolloway v. Turrill, 26
Wend. (N.Y.) 383, 399. See Acquittal.

## ACRE

A quantity of land containing 160 square
rods of land, in whatever shape. Serg. Land Laws
Pa. 185; Cro.Eliz. 476, 665; 6 Coke 67; Poph. 55;
Co.Litt. 5b.
Originally the word "acre" (acer, aker, or Sax, cecer)
was not used as a measure of land, or to signify any
determinate quantity of land, but to denote any open
ground, (latum quantumvis agrum,) wide champaign, or
field; which is still the meaning of the German acker,
derived probably from the same source, and is preserved
in the names of some places in England, as Castle Acre,
South Acre, etc. Burrill. Originally a strip in the fields
that was ploughed in the forenoon. Maitland, Domesday
and Beyond, 387.

## ACRE FOOT

325,850 gallons, or the amount of
water which will cover one acre one foot in depth.
Rowles v. Hadden, Tex.Civ.App., 210 S.W. 251,
ACRE RIGHT. "The share of a citizen of a New
England town in the common lands. The value
of the acre right was a fixed quantity in each
town, but varied in different towns. A 10-acre lot
or right in a certain town was equivalent to 113
acres of upland and 12 acres of meadow, and a
certain exact proportion was maintained between
the acre right and salable lands." Messages, etc.,
of the Presidents, Richardson, X, 230.
ACREFIGHT, or ACRE. A camp or field fight;
a sort of duel, or judicial combat, anciently fought
by single combatants, English and Scotch, between
the frontiers of the two kingdoms with sword
and lance. Called "campfight," and the com-
batants "champions," from the open "acre" or
field that was the stage of trial. Cowell.

## ACROMIAL PROCESS

A point in the region of
the shoulder about where the arm joins or fits into
the shoulder blade. Muskogee Electric Traction
Co. v. Mueller, 39 Okl. 63, 134 P. 51, 52.

## ACROSS

From side to side. Transverse to the
length of. Hannibal & St. J. R. Co. v. Packet Co.,
8 S.Ct. 874, 125 U.S. 260, 31 L.Ed. 731; but see
Appeal of Bennett's Branch Imp. Co., 65 Pa. 242.
It may mean over, Brown v. Meady, 10 Me. 391,
25 Am.Dec. 248; or "upon and along," Mt. Vernon
Telephone Co. v. Franklin Farmers' Co-op. Tele-
phone Co., 113 Me. 46, 92 A. 934, 935, Ann.Cas.
1917B, 649; or "upon," Jefferson County v. Louis-
ville & I. R. Co., 160 S.W. 502, 504, 155 Ky. 810;
or "within," Quanah, A. & P. Ry. Co. v. Cooper,
Van Deusen, 5 Pick. (Mass.) 163, where a grant of
a right of way across a lot of land was held not
to mean a right to enter at one side, go partly
across and come out at a place on the same side.

State, 9 Ala.App. 33, 63 So. 738.

## ACT

In Scotch practice. To do or perform
judicially; to enter of record. Surety "acted in
the Books of Adjournal." 1 Broun, 4.

## ACT

Denotes affirmative; expression of will,
purpose; carries idea of performance; primarily
that which is done or doing; exercise of power,
or effect of which power exerted is cause; a per-
formance; a deed. Brown v. Standard Casket
Mfg.*Co., 234 Ala. 512, 175 So. 358, 364.
In its most general sense, this noun signifies something
done voluntarily by a person; the exercise of an individ-
ual's power ; an effect produced in the external world by
an exercise of the power of a person objectively, prompted
by intention, and proximately caused by a motion of the
will. Herman v. Pan American Life Ins. Co., 183 La. 1045,
165 So. 195, 200. In a more technical sense, it means some-
thing done voluntarily by a person, aria of such a nature
that certain legal consequences attach to it. Jefferson
Standard Life Ins. Co. v. Myers, Tex.Com.App., 284 S.W.
216, 218. Thus a grantor acknowledges the conveyance to
be his "act and deed," the terms being synonymous. It
May denote something done by an individual, as a private
citizen, or as an officer ; or by a body of men, as a legis-
lature, a council, or a court of justice; including not
merely physical acts, but also decrees, edicts, laws, judg-
ments, resolves, awards, and determinations. Some gen-
eral laws made by the Congress of the United States are
styled joint resolutions, and these have the same force and
effect as those styled acts. But see Decher v. Vaughan, 209
Mich. 565, 177 N.W. 388, 392. Carries idea of performance.
Edmonds v. Shirley, 22 Ala.App. 398, 116 So. 303.
An instrument in writing to verify facts. Web-
ster, Dict.
It is used in this sense of the published acts of assembly,
congress, etc. In a sense approaching this, it has been
held in trials for treason that letters and other written
documents were acts; 1 Fost.Cr.Cas. 198; 2 Stark. 116.
Act indicates the intention. 8 Co. 146b; Broom,
Max. 301.
Civil Law
An act is a writing which states in a legal form
that a thing has been said, done, or agreed. Merl.
Repert.
Acts under private signature are those which have been
'made by private individuals under their hands.
Private acts are those made by private persons as regis-
ters in relation to their receipts and expenditures, sched-
ules, acquittances, and the like.
Public acts are those which have a public authority, and
which have been made before public officers, are author-
ized by a public seal, have been made public by the author-
ity of a magistrate, or which have been extracted and been
properly authenticated from public records.
Legislation
A written law, formally ordained or passed by
the legislative power of a state, called in England
an "act of parliament," and in the United States
an "act of congress," or of the "legislature;" a
statute. People v. Tiphaine, 3 Parker, Cr.R. (N.
Y.) 241; United States v. Smith, 27 Fed.Cas. 1167.
mously with act, People v. City of Buffalo, 161 N.Y.S. 706,
712, 175 App.Div. 218, but incorrectly; Sedgwick County
Com'rs v. Bailey, 13 Kan. 600; a bill being only the draft
or form of the act presented to the legislature but not
enacted; Southwark Bank v. Corn., 26 Pa. 446. "Act"
does not include ordinances or regulations made by local
authorities, or even statutes having only a local applica-
tion; People v. City of Buffalo, 157 N.Y.S. 938, 940, 93
Misc. 275; although sometimes used interchangeably with
"measure" and "law" ; Whittemore v. Terral, 140 Ark.
493, 215 S.W. 686, 687. Generally, the word refers to entire
statute enacted, rather than to a section. Board of Trus-
tees of Firemen's Relief and Pension Fund of City of
Muskogee v. Templeton, 184 Okl. 281, 86 P.2d 1000, 1002.
Acts are either public or private. Public acts (also
called general acts, or general statutes, or statutes at
large) are those which relate to the community generally,
or establish a universal rule for the governance of the
whole body politic. Private acts (formerly called special,
Co. Litt. 126a) are those which relate either to particular
persons (personal acts) or to particular places (local acts),
or which operate only upon specified individuals or their
private concerns. Unity v. Burrage, 103 U.S. 454, 26 L.Ed.
465. Public acts are those which concern the whole com-
munity and of which courts of law are bound to take
judicial notice. Sasser v. Martin, 101 Ga. 447, 29 S.E. 278.
A "special" or "private" act is one operating only on
particular persons and private concerns; a "local act" is
one applicable only to a particular part of the legislative
jurisdiction. Trumper v. School Dist. No. 55 of Mussel-
shell County, 55 Mont., 90, 173 P. 946, 947.
To denote an avowal of criminal acts, or the concession
of the truth of a criminal charge, the word "confession"
seems more appropriate.
Practice
Anything done by a court and reduced to writ-
ing; a decree, judgment, resolve, rule, order, or
other judicial proceeding. In Scotch law, the
orders and decrees of a court, and in French and
German law, all the records and documents in an
action, are called "acts."
Scotch Practice
An abbreviation of actor, (proctor or advocate,
especially for a plaintiff or pursuer,) used in
records. "Act. A. Alt. B." an abbreviation of
Actor, A. Alter, B.; that is, for the pursuer or
plaintiff, A., for the defender, B. 1 Broun, 336,
note.

## ACT BOOK

of a court. 1 Swin. 81.

## ACT IN PAIS

An act done out of court, and not

in the country, that is, according to the old com-
mon law, upon the very spot to be transferred, is
matter in pais. 2 Bl.Comm. 294.

## ACT OF ATTAINDER

ing a person. See Attainder.

## ACT OF BANKRUPTCY

a person liable to be proceeded against as a bank-
rupt, or for which he may be adjudged bankrupt.

## ACT OF GOD

An act occasioned exclusively by
violence of nature without the interference of any
human agency. It means a natural necessity pro-
ceeding from physical causes alone without the
intervention of man. It is an act, event, happen-
ing, or occurrence, a disaster and effect due to
natural causes and inevitable accident, or disaster;
a natural and inevitable necessity which implies
entire exclusion of all human agency which op-
erates without interference or aid from man and
which results from natural causes and is in no
sense attributable to human agency. It is an acci-
dent which could not have been occasioned by
human agency but proceeded from physical causes
alone. Short v. Kerr, 104 Ind.App. 118, 9 N.E.2d
114, 118.
In the civil law, vis major. Any misadventure or cas-
ualty is said to be caused by the "act of God" when it
happens by the direct, immediate, and exclusive operation
of the forces of nature, uncontrolled or uninfluenced by
the power of man and without human intervention, and
is of such a character that it could not have been pre-
vented or escaped from by any amount of foresight or
prudence, or by any reasonable degree of care or dilli-
gence, or by the aid of any appliances which the situation
of the party might reasonably require him to use. Inevit-
able accident, or casualty; any accident produced by any
physical cause which is irresistible, such as lightning,
tempests, perils of the seas, an inundation, or earthquake;
and also the sudden illness or death of persons. People v.

from natural causes, The Empress of France, D.C.N.Y., 49
F.2d 291. Misfortunes and accidents arising from inevita-
ble necessity which human prudence could not foresee or
prevent. Pleasure Beach Park Co. v. Bridgeport Dredge &
Dock Co., 116 Conn. 496, 165 A. 691, 692. Limited, v.
Lehigh Valley R. Co., D.C.N.Y., 254 F. 351, 353, a landside
in the Panama Canal, Gans S. S. Line v. Wilhelmsen, C.C.
A.N.Y., 275 F. 254, 261, and changes in the styles of wear-
ing apparel, Rosenblatt v. Winstanley, Mo.App., 186 S.W.
542, 543, are not "acts of God" ; otherwise, however, as to
a strike, accompanied with violence and intimidation, see
Southern Cotton Oil Co. v. Louisville & N. R. Co., 15
Ga.App. 751, 84 S.E. 198, 199.
The term is sometimes defined as equivalent to inevita-
ble accident; Neal v. Saunderson, 2 Sm. & M. (Miss.) 572,
41 Am.Dec. 609; Central of Georgia Ry. Co. v. Council
Bros., 36 Ga.App. 573, 137 S.E. 569, 570 (see, however, Can-

an aliment for him, or consent to his liberation;
which, if the creditor delay to do for 10 days, the
magistrate is authorized to set the debtor at
liberty. Bell. The term is often used to designate
a general act of parliament, originating with the

proportionately to the defects of the object, not
to cancel the sale; the judex had power, however,
to cancel the sale. Hunter, Rom.Law, 332, 505.

## ACTIO ARBITRARIA

Action depending on the
discretion of the judge. In this, unless defendant
would make amends to plaintiff as dictated by the
judge in his discretion, he was liable to be con-
demned. Hunter, Rom.Law, 825, 987.

## ACTIO BONE FIDEI

(Lat.: An action of good

the depositary has against the depositor, to com-
pel him to fulfil his engagement towards him.
Poth. Du Depot, n. 69.

bailor of a thing for hire may bring against the
bailee, in order to compel him to redeliver the
thing hired.

ing out of, or founded on, contract. 3 Bl.Comm.

## ACTIO EX DELICTO

fault, misconduct, or malfeasance. Inst. 4, 6, 15;
3 Bl.Comm. 117. Ex male ficio is the more com-

old process by which a thief can be pursued and
the goods vindicated. 2 Holdsw.Hist.Eng.L. 202.

## ACTIO HONORARIA

An honorary, or praetorian
action. Dig. 44, 7, 25, 35. Actiones honorarice are
those forms of remedies which were gradually
introduced by the praetors and diles, by virtue
of their equitable powers, in order to prevent the
failure of justice which too often resulted from
the employment of the actiones civiles. These
were found so beneficial in practice that they
eventually supplanted the old remedies, of which
in the time of Justinian hardly a trace remained.
Mackeldey, Civ.L. § 194; 5 Savigny, System.

## ACTIO IN FACTUM

In action adapted to the
particular case, having an analogy to some actio
in jus, the latter being founded on some subsisting
acknowledged law. 1 Spence, Eq.Jur. 212. The
origin of these actions is similar to that of actions
on the case at common law.
Admiralty Law
An action directed against the particular person
who is to be charged with the liability. It is dis-
tinguished from an actio in rem, which is a suit
directed against a specific thing (as a vessel) ir-
respective of the ownership of it, to enforce a
claim or lien upon it, or to obtain, out of the
thing or out of the proceeds of its sale, satisfac-
tion for an injury alleged by the claimant.
Civil Law
An action against the person, founded on a per-
sonal liability; an action seeking redress for the
violation of a jus in personam or right available
against a particular individual.

## ACTIO IN REM

In the civil and common law.
An action for a thing; an action for the recovery
of a thing possessed by another. Inst. 4, 6, 1. An
action for the enforcement of a right (or for
redress for its invasion) which was originally
available against all the world, and not in any
special sense against the individual sued, until he
violated it. See In Rem.

## ACTIO JUDICATI

An action instituted, after
four months had elapsed after the rendition of
judgment, in which the judge issued his warrant
to seize, first, the movables, which were sold
within eight days afterwards; and then the im-
movables, which were delivered in pledge to the
creditors, or put under the care of a curator, and
if, at the end of two months, the debt was not
paid, the land was sold. Dig. 42, 1; Cod. 8, 34.
According to some authorities, if the defendant then
utterly denied the rendition of the former judgment, the
plaintiff was driven to a new action, conducted like any
other action, which was called actio judicati, and which
had for its object the determination of the question
whether such a judgment had been rendered. The exact
meaning of the term is by no means clear. See Savigny,
Syst. 305, 411; 3 Ortolan, Just. § 2033.

## ACTIO LEGIS AQUILINE

An action under the
Aquilian law; an action to recover damages for
maliciously or injuriously killing or wounding the
slave or beast of another, or injuring in any way
a thing belonging to another. Otherwise called
damni injurice actio.

## ACTIO MANDATI

Included actions to enforce
contracts of mandate or obligations arising out
of them. Hunter, Rom.Law, 316.

## ACTIO MIXTA

A mixed action; an action
brought for the recovery of a thing, or compensa-
tion for damages, and also for the payment of a
penalty; partaking of the nature both of an actio
in rem and in personam. Inst. 4, 6, 16, 18, 19, 20;
Mackeld.Rom.Law, § 209.
ACTIO NEGATORIA (or NEGATIVA). An ac-
tion brought to repel a claim of the defendant to a
servitude in the plaintiff's land. Mackeld.Rom.
Law, § 324. See Actio Confessoria.

## ACTIO NEGOTIORUM GESTORUM

Included ac-
tions between principal and agent and other par-
took the transaction of business for another.

## ACTIO NON

In pleading. The Latin name of
that part of a special plea which follows next
after the statement of appearance and defense,
and declares that the plaintiff "ought not to have
or maintain his aforesaid action thereof against"
the defendant (in Latin, actionem non habere
debet). 1 Chit.Plead. 531; 2 id. 421; Stephens,
Plead. 394.
ACTIO NON ACCREVIT INFRA SEX ANNOS.
The name of the plea of the statute of limitations,
when the defendant alleges that the plaintiff's ac-
tion has not accrued within six years.

## ACTIO NON DATUR NON DAMNIFICATO

An
action is not given to one who is not injured.
Jenk.Cent. 69.

## ACTIO NON FACIT REUM, NISI MENS SIT REA

An act does not make one guilty, unless
the intention be bad. Lofft, 37.

## ACTIO NON ULTERIUS

In English pleading.
A name given to the distinctive clause in the plea
to the further maintenance of the action, intro-
duced in place of the plea puis darrein continu-
ance; the averment being that the plaintiff ought
not further (ulterius) to have or maintain his ac-
tion. Steph.Pl. 64, 65, 401.

## ACTIO NOXALIS

A noxal action; an action
which lay against a master for a crime commit-
ted or injury done by his slave; and in which the
master had the alternative either to pay for the
damage done or to deliver up the slave to the com-
plaining party. Inst. 4, 8, pr.; Heinecc.Elem. lib.
4, tit. 8. So called from noxa, the offense or in-
jury committed. Inst. 4, 8, 1.

## ACTIO PERPETUA

An action without limita-
tion period.

## ACTIO PERSONALIS

In the civil and common
law. A personal action.
The ordinary term for this kind of action in the civil
law is actio in personam, (q. v.,) the word personalis
being of only occasional occurrence. Inst. 4, 6, 8, in tit.;
Id. 4, 11, pr. 1. Bracton, however, uses it freely, and
hence the personal action of the common law. Bract. fols.
102a, 159b. See Action.

## ACTIO PERSONALIS MORITUR CUM PER- SONA

A personal right of action dies with the
person. Noy, Max. 14.
The maxim was originally applied to almost every form
of action, whether arising out of contract or tort, but the
common law was modified by the Statute of 4 Edward the
III. Momand v. Twentieth-Century Fox Film Corporation,
D.C.Okl., 37 F.Supp. 649, 652.

## ACTIO PIGNORATITIA

An action of pledge;
an action founded on the contract of pledge
(pignus). Dig. 13, 7; Cod. 4, 24.

## ACTIO PCENALIS

Called also actio ex delicto.
An action in which a penalty was recovered of
the delinquent.
Actiones pcenales and actiones mixtce comprehended
cases of injuries, for which the civil law permitted redress
sally regards as crimes; that is, offenses against society
at large, and punished by proceedings in the name of the
state alone. Thus, theft, receiving stolen goods, robbery,
malicious mischief, and the murder or negligent homicide
of a slave (in which case an injury to property was
involved), gave rise to private actions for damages against
the delinquent. Inst. 4, 1. De obligationibus quce ex
delicto nascuntur; id. 2. De bonis vi raptis; id. 3. De
lege Aquilia. And see Mackeldey, Civ.L. § 196; 5 Savigny,
System, § 210.
Actio pcenalis in haredem non datur, nisi forte
ex damno locupletior hares factus sit. A penal
action is not given against an heir, unless, in-
deed, such heir is benefited by the wrong.

## ACTIO PRIEJUDICIALIS

A preliminary or pre-
paratory action. An action instituted for the de-
termination of some preliminary matter on which
other litigated matters depend, or for the deter-
mination of some point or question arising in an-
other or principal action; and so called from its
being determined before, (prius, or prce judicari.)
ACTIO PRIESCRIPTIS VERBIS. A form of ac-
tion which derived its force from continued usage
or the responsa prudentium, and was founded on
the unwritten law. 1 Spence, Eq.Jur. 212. The
distinction between this action and an actio in
factum is said to be, that the latter was founded
not on usage or the unwritten law, but by analogy
to or on the equity of some subsisting law; 1
Spence, Eq.Jur. 212.

## ACTIO PRIETORIA

A prae torian action; one
introduced by the pra tor, as distinguished from
the more ancient actio civilis, (q. v.) Inst. 4, 6, 3;
Mackeld.Rom.Law, § 207.

## ACTIO PRO SOCIO

An action of partnership.
An action brought by one partner against his
associates to compel them to carry out the terms
of the partnership agreement. Story, Partn., Ben-
nett ed. § 352; Pothier, Contr. de Societe, n. 34.

## ACTIO PUBLICIANA

An action which lay for
one who had lost a thing of which he had bona
fide obtained possession, before he had gained a
property in it, in order to have it restored, under
color that he had obtained a property in it by
prescription. Inst. 4, 6, 4; Heinecc. Elem. lib. 4,
tit. 6, § 1131; Halifax, Anal. b. 3, c. 1, n. 9. It was
an honorary action, and derived its name from the
pr tor Publicius, by whose edict it was first given.
ae
Inst. 4, 6, 4.

## ACTIO QUIELIBET IT SUA VIA

Every action
proceeds in its own way. Jenk.Cent. 77.

## ACTIO QUOD JUSSU

An action given against
a master, founded on some business done by his
slave, acting under his order, ( jussu.) Inst. 4, 7,
1; Dig. 15, 4; Cod. 4, 26.

## ACTIO QUOD METUS CAUSA

An action grant-
ed to one who had been compelled by unlawful
force, or fear (metus causa) that was not ground-
less, (metus probabilis or Justus,) to deliver, sell,
or promise a thing to another. Bract. fol. 103b;
Mackeld.Rom.Law, § 226.
in the civil law was rei vindicatio. Inst. 4, 6, 3.

## ACTIO REDHIBITORIA

An action to cancel a
sale in consequence of defects in the thing sold.
It was prosecuted to compel complete restitution to the
seller of the thing sold, with its produce and accessories,

Rom.Law, 332. See Redhibitory Action.

## ACTIO RERUM AMOTARUM

An action for
things removed; an action which, in cases of
divorce, lay for a husband against a wife, to re-
cover things carried away by the latter, in con-
templation of such divorce. Dig. 25, 2; Id. 25, 2;
25, 30. It also lay for the wife against the hus-
band in such cases. Dig. 25, 2, 7, 11; Cod. 5, 21.

## ACTIO RESCISSORIA

An action for restoring
plaintiff to a right or title which he has lost by
prescription, in a case where the equities are such
that he should be relieved from the operation of
the prescription. Mackeld.Rom.Law, § 226.
An action to rescind a prescriptive title by one
who was entitled to exemption from the prescrip-
tion law, as a minor, etc.

## ACTIO SERVIANA

lessor of a farm, or rural estate, to recover the
goods of the lessee or farmer, which were pledged
or bound for the rent. Inst. 4, 6, 7.

## ACTIO STRICTI JURIS

An action of strict
right. The class of civil law personal actions,
which were adjudged only by the strict law, and
in which the judge was limited to the precise
language of the formula, and had no discretion-
ary power to regard the bona fides of the trans-
action. See Inst. 4, 6, 28; Gaius, iii. 137; Mackeld.
Rom.Law, § 210; 1 Spence, Eq.Jur. 218.

## ACTIO TEMPORALIS

An action which must
be brought within a limited time. See Limitation.

## ACTIO TUTELIE

Action founded on the duties
or obligations arising on the relation analogous to
that of guardian and ward.

## ACTIO UTILIS

A beneficial action or equitable
action. An action founded on equity instead of
strict law, and available for those who had eq-
uitable rights or the beneficial ownership of prop-
erty.
Actions are divided into actiones directce or utiles. The
former are founded on certain legal obligations which from
their origin were accurately defined and recognized as ac-
tionable. The latter were formed analogically in imitation
of the former. They were permitted in legal obligations
for which the actiones directce were not originally intend-
ed, but which resembled the legal obligations which formed
the basis of the direct action. Mackeld.Rom.Law, § 207.

## ACTIO VENDITI

An action employed in behalf
of a seller, to compel a buyer to pay the price,
or perform any special obligations embodied in
a contract of sale. Hunter, Rom.Law, 332.

## ACTIO VI BONORUM RAPTORUM

6, 19. Bracton describes it as lying de rebus mo-
bilibus vi ablatis sive robbatis, (for movable
things taken away by force, or robbed.) Brae.
fol. 103b.

## ACTIO VULGARIS

A legal action; a common
action. Sometimes used for actio directa. Mack-
eld.Rom.Law, § 207.

## ACTION

Conduct; behavior; something done;
the condition of acting; an act or series of acts.

Scotch Law
A suit or judicial proceeding.
Suit Distinguished
Strictly applied, action does not usually refer
to chancery practice. City of Beckley v. Craig-
head, 125 W.Va. 484, 24 S.E.2d 908, 911. But
terms "action" and "suit" are now nearly, if not
entirely, synonymous. (3 Bl.Comm. 3, 116, et pas-
sim.) Elmo v. James, Tex.Civ.App., 282 S.W. 835,
839; Coleman v. Los Angeles County, 180 Cal.
714, 182 P. 440. Or, if there be a distinction, it
is that the term "action" is generally confined to
proceedings in a court of law, while "suit" is
equally applied to prosecutions at law or in equity.
McBride v. University Club, 112 Ohio St. 69, 146
N.E. 804, 805; Guarantee Trust & Banking Co. v.
Dickson, 148 Ga. 311, 96 S.E. 561, 562; Niantic
Mills Co. v. Riverside & 0. Mills, 19 R.I. 34, 31 A.
432; Ulshafer v. Stewart, 71 Pa. 170. Formerly,
however, an action was considered as terminat-
ing with the giving of judgment, the execution
forming no part of it. (Litt. § 504; Co.Litt. 289a.)
A suit included the execution. (Litt. § 291a.) So,
an action is termed by Lord Coke, "the right of
a suit." (2 Inst. 40.) Burrill.
Types of Actions
Actions are called, in common-law practice, ex
contractu when they are founded on a contract;
ex delicto when they arise out of a tort. Nelson
v. Great Northern R. Co., 28 Mont. 297, 72 Pac.
642; Van Oss v. Synon, 85 Wis. 661, 56 N.W. 190.
If a cause of action arises from a breach of promise, the
action is "ex contractu," and, if it arises from breach of
duty growing out of contract, it is "ex delicto." Tort or
trespass is none the less such because it incidentally in-
volves breach of contract. Berning v. Colodny & Colodny,
103 Cal.App. 188, 284 P. 496, 498.
As to class or representative actions. See Class
Or Representative Action.
As to the distinction between a revocatory ac-
tion and an action in simulation, see Chapman v.
Irwin, 157 La. 920, 103 So. 263, 265.
Civil actions are such as lie in behalf of persons to en-
force their rights or obtain redress of wrongs in their rela-
tion to individuals.
Common law actions are such as will lie, on the par-
ticular facts, at common law, without the aid of a stat-
ute.
Criminal actions are such as are instituted by the sov-
ereign power, for the purpose of punishing or preventing
offenses against the public.
Local action. See Local Action.
Mixed actions partake of twofold nature of real and
personal actions, having for their object the demand and
restitution of real property and also personal damages
for a wrong sustained. 3 Bl.Comm. 118; Hall v. Decker,
48 Me. 257. Mixed actions are those which are brought
for the specific recovery of lands, like real actions, but
comprise, joined with this claim, one for damages in re-
spect of such property; such as the action of waste, where,
in addition to the recovery of the place wasted, the de-
mandant claims damages; the writ of entry, in which, by
statute, a demand of mesne profits may be joined; and
dower, in which a claim for detention may be included. 48
Me. 255. In the civil law, an action in which some spe-
cific thing was demanded, and also some personal obliga-
tion claimed to be performed; or, in other words, an ac-
tion which proceeded both in rem and in personam. Inst.
4, 6, 20.
Penal actions are such as are brougnt, either by the state
or by an individual under permission of a statute, to en-
force a penalty imposed by law for the commission of a
prohibited act.
Personal action. In civil law, an action in personam. It
seeks to enforce an obligation imposed on the defendant
by his contract or delict; that is, it is the contention that
he is bound to transfer some dominion or to perform some
service or to repair some loss. Gaius, bk. 4, § 2. In com-
mon law. An action brought for the recovery of some debt
or for damages for some personal injury, in contradistinc-
tion to the old real actions, which related to real property
only. See 3 Bl.Comm. 117. Boyd v. Cronan, 71 Me. 286;
Doe v. Waterloo Min. Co., C.C.Cal., 43 F. 219; Osborn v.
Fall River, 140 Mass. 508, 5 N.E. 483. An action which can
be brought only by the person himself who is injured, and
not by his representatives.
Popular actions, in English usage, are those actions
which are given upon the breach of a penal statute, and
which any man that will may sue on account of the king
and himself, as the statute allows and the case requires.
Because the action is not given to one especially, but gen-
erally to any that will prosecute, it is called "action pop-
ular ;" and, from the words used in the process, (qui tam
pro domino rege sequitur quam pro se ipso, who sues as
well for the king as for himself,) it is called a qui tam
action. Tomlins.
Real actions. At common law, one brought for the spe-
cific recovery of lands, tenements, or hereditaments.
Steph.Pl. 3; Crocker v. Black, 16 Mass. 448; Hall v. Deck-
er, 48 Me. 256; Doe v. Waterloo Min. Co., C.C.Cal., 43 F.
220; Mathews v. Sniggs, 75 Okl. 108, 182 P. 703, 708. They
are droitural when they are based upon the right of prop-
erty, and possessory when based upon the right of posses-
sion. They are either writs of right ; writs of entry upon
disseisin (which lie in the per, the per et cui, or the post),
intrusion, or alienation; writs ancestral possessory, as
mort d'ancestor, aiel, besaiel, cossinage, or nuper obiit.
Com.Dig. Actions (D 2). The former class was divided
into droitural, founded upon demandant's own seisin, and
ancestral droitural upon the demandant's claim in respect
of a mere right descended to him from an ancestor. Pos-
sessory actions were divided in the same way—as to the
demandant's own seisin and as to that of his ancestor.
Among the civilians, real actions, otherwise called "vindi-
cations," were those in which a man demanded something
that was his own. They were founded on doiminion, or
jus in re. The real actions of the Roman law were not,
like the real actions of the common law, confined to real
estate, but they included personal, as well as real, proper-
ty. Wharton.
Statutory actions are such as can only be based upon the
particular statutes creating them.
Transitory actions are those founded upon a cause of ac-
tion not necessarily referring to or arising in any particu-
lar locality. Their characteristic feature is that the right
of action follows the person of the defentlant. Brown v.
Brown, 155 Tenn. ;,30, 296 S.W. 356, 358. Actions are
"transitory" when the transactions relied on might have
taken place anywhere, and are "local" when they could
not occur except in some particular place ; the distinction
being in the nature of the subject of the injury, and not
in the means used or the place at which the cause of action
arises. Brady v. Brady, 161 N.C. 324, 77 S.E. 235, 236, 44
L.R.A.,N.S., 279; Taylor v. Sommers Bros. Match Co., 35
Idaho, 30, 204 P. 472, 474, 42 A.L.R. 189. The test of
whether an action is local or transitory is whether the in-
jury is done to a subject-matter which, in its nature, could
not arise beyond the locality of its situation, in contra-
distinction to the subject causing the injury. Mattix v.
Swepston; 127 Tenn. 693, 155 S.W. 928, 929. Actions triable
where defendant resides are termed "transitory" and those
triable where the subject-matter is situated are termed "lo-
cal." State v. District Court of Swift County, 164 Minn.
433, 205 N.W. 284, 285.
See Cause of Action.

Loan Ass'n v. Watson, 226 Ala. 526, 147 So. 817,
Where one person has received money or its equivalent
under such circumstances that in equity and good con-
science he ought not to retain it and in justice it belongs
to another. Interstate Life & Accident Co. v. Cook, 19
Tenn.App. 290, 86 S.W.2d 887, 891.

Cowell.

## ACTION OF ASSIZE

es the title of the demandant, merely by showing

## ACTION OF ASSUMPSIT

See Assumpsit.

## ACTION OF BOOK DEBT

A form of action for
the recovery of claims, such as are usually evi-
denced by a book-account; this action is princi-
pally used in Vermont and Connecticut. Newton
v. Higgins, 2 Vt. 366.

## ACTION ON CONTRACT

An action brought to
enforce rights whereof the contract is the evi-
kusai Kisen Kabushiki Kaisha v. Argos Mercan-
tile Corporation, C.C.A.N.Y., 280 F. 700, 701.

## ACTION ON THE CASE

A species of personal
action of very extensive application, otherwise
called "trespass on the case," or simply "case,"
from the circumstance of the plaintiff's whole
case or cause of complaint being set forth at
length in the original writ by which formerly it
was always commenced. 3 Bl.Comm. 122. Wal-
lace v. Wilmington & N. R. Co., 8 Houst. (Del.)
529, 18 A. 818.
In its most comprehensive signification it includes as-
sumpsit as well as an action in form ex delicto; at present
when it is mentioned it is usually understood to mean an
action in form ex delicto. It is founded on the common law
or upon acts of Parliament, and lies generally to recover
damages for torts not committed with force, actual or im-
plied; or having been occasioned by force where the mat-
ter affected was not tangible, or the injury was not immed-
iate but consequential; or where the interest in the proper-
ty was only in reversion, in all of which cases trespass is
not sustainable; 1 Chit.P1. 132. In the progress of judicial
contestation it was discovered that there was a mass of tor-
tious wrongs unattended by direct and immediate force, or
where the force, though direct, was not expended on an ex-
isting right of present enjoyment, for which the then
known forms of action furnished no redress. The action
on the case was instituted to meet this want. And wrongs
which will maintain an action on the case are frequently
committed in the nonobservance of duties, which are but
the implication of contract obligation, duties of requisite
skill, fidelity, diligence, and a proper regard for the rights
of others, implied in every obligation to serve another. If
the cause of action arises from a breach of promise, the ac-
tion is "ex contractu" ; but if the cause of action arises
from a breach of duty growing out of the contract, it is
in form ex delicto and case. When there is a contract, ei-
ther express or implied, from which a common-law duty
results, an action on the case lies for the breach of that
duty. Bently-Beale, Inc. v. Wesson Oil & Snowdrift Sales
Co., 231 Ala. 562, 165 So. 830, 832. See Assumpsit.

## ACTION QUASI IN REM

An action brought
against persons which only seeks to subject cer-
tain property of those persons to discharge of
claims asserted and judgment therein is only con-
clusive between parties and their privies. Tobin
v. McClellan, 225 Ind. 335, 75 N.E.2d 149, 151.
ACTION REDHIBITORY, See Redhibitory Ac-
tion.

## ACTION TO QUIET TITLE

One in which plain-
tiff asserts his own estate and declares generally
that defendant claims some estate in the land,
without defining it, and avers that the claim is
without foundation, and calls on defendant to set
forth the nature of his claim, so that it may be de-
termined by decree.
It differs from a "suit to remove a cloud," in that plain-
tiff therein declares on his own title, and also avers the
source and nature of defendant's claim, points out its de-
fect, and prays that it may be declared void as a cloud on
plaintiff's estate. Manning v. Gregoire, 97 Or. 394, 192 P.
406, 407. The apparent difference between an action to re-
store a lost instrument and one to quiet title is that, in the
former, ordinarily both the titles of plaintiff and defendant
are deraigned in the complaint, which must disclose that,
notwithstanding an apparent interest of defendant the
property belongs to plaintiff ; and in the latter action the
complaint need only allege the ultimate fact of plaintiff's
interest and defendant's outstanding claim. Nicholson v.
Nicholson, 67 Mont. 517, 216 P. 328, 329, 31 A.L.R. 548.
See, also, Slette v. Review Pub. Co., 71 Mont. 518, 230 P.
580, 581. It embraces every sort of a claim whereby the
plaintiff might be deprived of his property or his title
might be incommoded or damnified by assertion of an out-
standing title already held or to grow out of the adverse
pretension. Bank of American Nat. Trust & Savings Ass'n
v. Town of Atherton, 60 Cal.App.2d 268, 140 P.2d 678, 680.

## ACTIONABLE

That for which an action will
lie, furnishing legal ground for an action.

## ACTIONABLE FRAUD

Deception practiced in
order to induce another to part with property or
surrender some legal right; a false representa-
tion made with an intention to deceive; may be
committed by stating what is known to be false
or by professing knowledge of the truth of a state-
ment which is false, but in either case, the essen-
tial ingredient is a falsehood uttered with intent to
deceive. Sawyer v. Prickett, 19 Wall. 146, 22 L.
Ed. 105.
To constitute "actionable fraud," it must appear that de-
fendant made a material representation; that it was false ;
that when he made it he knew it was false,- or made it
recklessly without any knowledge of its truth and as a
positive assertion ; that he made it with intention that it
should be acted on by plaintiff ; that plaintiff acted in re-
liance on it; and that plaintiff thereby suffered injury.
Blair v. McCool, 136 Or. 139, 295 P. 950, 952. Essential ele-
ments are representation, falsity, scienter, .deception, and
injury. Cobb v. Cobb, 211 N.C. 146, 189 S.E. 479, 482.

## ACTIONABLE MISREPRESENTATION

A false
statement respecting a fact material to the con-
tract and which is influential in procuring it.
Wise v. Fuller, 29 N.J.Eq. 257.

## ACTIONABLE NEGLIGENCE

The breach or
nonperformance of a legal duty, through neglect
or carelessness, resulting in damage or injury to
another. Fidelity & Casualty Co. v. Cutts, 95 Me.
162, 49 Atl. 673.
It is failure of duty, omission of something which ought
to have been done, or doing of something which ought not
to have been done, or which reasonable man, guided by
considerations which ordinarily regulate conduct of hu-
man affairs, would or would not do. Goff v. Emde, 32
Ohio App. 216, 167 N.E. 699, 700. Essential elements are
failure to exercise due care, injury, or damage, and proxi-
mate cause. Rountree v. Fountain, 203 N.C. 381, 166 S.E.
329, 330.

## ACTIONABLE NUISANCE

Anything wrong-
fully done or permitted which injures or annoys
another in the enjoyment of his legal rights. Mil-
ler v. City of Dayton, 70 Ohio App. 173, 41 N.E.2d
728, 730.
Anything injurious to health, or indecent, or offensive to
the senses, or an obstruction to the free use of property so
as to interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of life or
property. Cooper v. Overton, 102 Tenn. 211, 52 S.W. 183,
45 L.R.A. 591.

## ACTIONABLE TORT

To constitute an "action-
able tort," there must be a legal duty, imposed by
statute or otherwise, owing by defendant to the
one injured, and in the absence of such duty dam-
age caused is "injury without wrong" or "damnum
absque injuria." Coleman v. California Yearly
Meeting of Friends Church, 27 Cal.App.2d 579,
81 P.2d 469, 470.

## ACTIONABLE WORDS

In law of libel and
slander, such words as naturally imply damage.
Dahm v. O'Connell, 161 N.Y.S. 909, 911, 96 Misc.
Words actionable only on allegation and proof
of special damage. Knapp v. Post Printing &
Publishing Co., 111 Colo. 492, 144 P.2d 981, 984.
Words not actionable per se upon their face, but only
in consequence of extrinsic facts showing circumstances
under which they were said or the damages resulting to
slandered party therefrom. Smith v. Mustain, 210 Ky. 445,
276 S.W. 154, 155, 44 A.L.R. 386. Not injurious on their
face in their usual and natural signification, but only so in
consequence of extrinsic facts and requiring innuendo.
Piplack v. Mueller, 97 Fla. 440, 121 So. 459.
Per Se
Words in themselves libelous. Knapp v. Post
Printing & Publishing Co., 111 Colo. 492, 144 P.2d
981, 984.
Words which law presumes must actually, proximately,
and necessarily damage defendant for which general dam-
ages are recoverable and whose injurious character is a
fact of common notoriety, established by the general con-
sent of men, necessarily importing damage. Ellsworth v.
Martindale-Hubbell Law Directory, 66 N.D. 578, 268 N.W.
400, 407. Words themselves opprobrious ; susceptible only
of opprobrious meaning. Fite v. Oklahoma Pub. Co., 146
Okl. 150, 293 P. 1073, 1075. Importing a charge of some
punishable crime or some offensive disease, imputing moral
turpitude, or tending to injure a party in his trade or
business. Barnes v. Trundy, 31 Me. 321; Lemons v. Wells,
78 Ky. 117; Mayrant v. Richardson, 1 Nott & McC. 347, 9
Am.Dec. 707. Tending to injure one's reputation, thereby
exposing him to public hatred, contempt or ridicule, tend-
ing to degrade or lower him. Hodges v. Cunningham,
160 Miss. 576, 135 So. 215, 217. Such words are actionable
without allegation of special damages. Kluender v. Se-
mann, 203 Iowa 68, 212 N.W. 326, 327. See also Libelous
per se.

## ACTIONABLE WRONG

Committed when a re-
sponsible person has neglected to use a reasonable
degree of care for protection of another person
from such injury as under existing circumstances
should reasonably have been foreseen as a proxi-
mate consequence of that negligence. Chadwick
v. Bush, 174 Miss. 75, 163 So. 823, 824.

## ACTIONARE

L. Lat. (From actio, an action.)
In old records. To bring an action; to prosecute,
or sue. Thorn's Chron.; Whishaw.

## ACTIONARY

A foreign commercial term for
the proprietor of an action or share of a public
company's stock; a stockholder.

## ACTIONES LEGIS

In the Roman law, legal or
lawful action; actions of or at law,) legitimoe ac-
tiones.) Dig. 1, 2, 2, 6.

## ACTIONES NOMINATIE

(Lat. named actions).
In the English chancery, writs for which there
were precedents. The statute of Westminster, 2,
c. 24, gave chancery authority to form new writs
in consimili case; hence the action on the case.

## ACTIONS

(Fr.) Shares of corporate stock.
Compare Actionary.

## ACTIONS ORDINARY

In Scotch law, all actions
which are not rescissory. Ersk.Inst. 4, 1, 18.

## ACTIONS RESCISSORY

In Scotch law, these
are either (1) actions of proper improbation for
declaring a writing false or forged; (2) actions
of reduction-improbation for the production of a
ascertained under the certification that the writ-
ing if not produced shall be declared false or
forged; and (3) actions of simple reduction, for
declaring a writing called for null until produced.
Ersk.Princ. 4, 1, 5.

## ACTIONUM GENERA MAXIME SUNT SER- VANDA

The kinds of actions are especially to
be preserved. Lofft 460.

## ACTIVE

That is in action; that demands ac-
tion; actually subsisting; the opposite of pas-
sive. An active debt is one which draws interest.
An active trust is a confidence connected with a
duty. An active use is a present legal estate.

## ACTIVE CONCEALMENT

This implies a pur-
pose or design accomplished by words or acts,
while passive concealment consists in mere silence
where there is a duty to speak. Vendt v. Duenke,
Mo.App., 210 S.W.2d 692, 699.
Concealment becomes a fraud where it is effected by mis-
leading and' deceptive talk, acts, or conduct, where it is
accompanied by misrepresentations, or where, in addition
to a party's silence, there is any statement, word, or act
on his part which tends affirmatively to a suppression of
the truth. Such conduct is designated active concealment.
Equitable Life Ins. Co. of Iowa v. Halsey, Stuart & Co.,
C.C.A.I11., 112 F.2d 302, 309.

## ACTIVE NEGLIGENCE

A term of extensive
meaning obviously embracing many occurrences
that would fall short of willful wrongdoing, or of
crass negligence, for example, all inadvertent acts
causing injury to others, resulting from failure
to exercise ordinary care, likewise all acts the
effects of which are misjudged or unforeseen,
through want of proper attention, or reflection,
and hence the term covers the acts of willful
wrongdoing and also those which are not of that
character. Cohen v. Noel, Tenn.App., 104 S.W.2d
1001, 1005.

## ACTIVE SERVICE

"Active service" in army
does not necessarily mean actual service, but
means service performed at direction of superior
officer or officers while receiving emoluments to
which soldier is entitled. United States v. Wood-
worth, D.C.Mass., 36 F.Supp. 645, 646.

## ACTIVE TRUST

See Trust.

## ACTIVITY

A recreational "activity" is a physi-
cal or gymnastic exercise, an agile performance,
such as dancing. McClure v. Board of Education
of City of Visalia, 38 Cal.App. 500, 176 P. 711, 712.

## ACTON BURNEL, STATUTE OF

In English
law, a statute, otherwise called Statutum Merca-
torum or de Mercatoribus the statute of the mer-
chants, made at a parliament held at the castle or
village of Acton Burnel in Shropshire, in the 11th
year of the reign of Edward I. 2 Reeves, Eng.
Law, 158-162. It was a statute for the collection
of debts, the earliest of its class, being enacted in
1283. A further statute for the same object, and
known as De Mercatoribus, was enacted 13 Edw.
I. (c. 3.). See Statute Merchant.
ACTOR.
Old European Law
A patron, proctor, advocate, or pleader; one
who acted for another in legal matters; one
who represented a party and managed his cause.
An attorney, bailiff, or steward; one who man-
aged or acted for another. The Scotch "doer" is
the literal translation.
Roman Law
One who acted for another; one who attended
to another's business; a manager or agent. A
slave who attended to, transacted, or superintend-
ed his master's business or affairs, received and
paid out moneys, and kept accounts. Burrill.
The word has a variety of closely-related meanings,
very nearly corresponding with manager. Thus, actor
domince, manager of his master's farm; actor ecclesice,
manager of church property; actores provinciarum, tax-
gatherers, treasurers, and managers of the public debt.
Actor ecclesice.—An advocate for a church; one who
protects the temporal interests of a church. Actor villce
was the steward or head-bailiff of a town or village. Cow-
ell.
Plaintiff or complainant. In a civil or private action the
plaintiff was often called by the Romans "petitor;" in a
public action (causa publica) he was called "accusator."
The defendant was called "revs," both in private and pub-
lic causes; this term, however, according to Cicero, (De
Orat. 43,) might signify either party, as indeed we
might conclude from the word itself. In a private action,
the defendant was often called "adversarius," but either
party might be called so.
Also, the term is used of a party who, for the time
baing, sustains the burden of proof, or has the initiative in
the suit.
Actor qui contra regulam quid adduxit, non est
audiendus. A plaintiff (or pleader) is not to be
heard who has advanced anything against author-
ity, (or against the rule.)
Actor sequitur forum rei. According as rei is
intended as the genitive of res, a thing, or reus,
a defendant, this phrase means: The plaintiff fol-
lows the forum of the property in suit, or the fo-
rum of the defendant's residence. Branch, Max. 4.
Home, Law Tr. 232; Story, Confl.L. § 325 k; 2
Kent 462.

## ACTORE NON PROBANTE REUS ABSOLVI- TUR

When the plaintiff does not prove his case
the defendant is acquitted (or absolved). Hob.

## ACTORI INCUMBIT ONUS PROBANDI

The
burden of proof rests on the plaintiff, (or on the
party who advances a proposition affirmatively.)
Hob. 103.

## ACTORNAY

In old Scotch law, an attorney.
Skene.

## ACTRIX

Lat. A female actor; a female plain-
tiff. Calvinus, Lex.

## ACTS OF COURT

Legal memoranda made in
the admiralty courts in England, in the nature of
pleas.

## ACTS OF POSSESSION

To constitute adverse
if seen by the party whose claim is sought to be
divested, would apprise him that the party doing
the acts claimed the ownership of the property.
Crosby v. City of Greenville, 183 Mich. 452, 150
N.W. 246, 248.

## ACTS OF SEDERUNT

In Scotch law, ordinances
for regulating the forms of proceeding, before the
court of session, in the administration of justice,
made by the judges, who have the power by virtue
of a Scotch act of parliament passed in 1540.
Ersk. Prin. § 14.

## ACTUAL

Real; substantial; existing presently
in act, having a valid objective existence as op-
posed to that which is merely theoretical or possi-
ble. Ciaccio v. Hartman, 170 La. 949, 129 So. 540.
Opposed to potential, possible, virtual, conceiv-
able, theoretical, hypothetical, or nominal. Amer-
ican Ins. Co. of Newark, N. J., v. Seminole County
Board of Education, 51 Ga.App. 808, 181 S.E. 783,
786. Something real, in opposition to construc-
tive or speculative; something existing in act.
Astor v. Merritt, 4 S.Ct. 413, 111 U.S. 202, 28 L.
Ed. 401. Existing in act, fact, or reality. Guar-
isco v. Massachusetts Bonding & Insurance Co.,
4 N.Y.S.2d 788, 792, 167 Misc. 875.
It is used as a legal term in contradistinction to virtual
or constructive as of possession or occupation; Cleveland
v. Crawford, 7 Hun (N.Y.) 616; or an actual settler,
which implies actual residence; ' McIntyre v. Sherwood, 82
Cal. 139, 22 Pac. 937. An actual seizure means nothing
more than seizure, since there was no fiction of construc-
tive seizure before the act; L.R. 6 Exch. 203.
Actually is opposed to seemingly, pretendedly, or feign-
edly, as actually engaged in farming means really, truly,
in fact; In re Strawbridge & Mays, 39 Ala. 367; Ayer &
Lord Tie Co. v. Commonwealth, 208 Ky. 606, 271 S.W. 693,
As to actual "Bias," "Damages," "Delivery," "Fraud,"
"Mal ice, " "Notice," "Occupation," "Ouster," "Posses-
sion," "Residence," "Seisin," "Total Loss," see those ti-
tles.

## ACTUAL AUTHORITY

In the law of agency,
such authority as a principal intentionally confers

Max. 43.
Laws are adapted to cases which frequently occur. A
statute, which, construed according to its plain words, is,
in all cases of ordinary occurrence, in no degree incon-
sistent or unreasonable, should not be varied by construc-
tion in every case, merely because there is one possible
but highly improbable case in which the laW would oper-
ate with great severity and against our notions of justice.

of the statute should be varied in that particular case, so
as to obviate the injustice. 7 Exch. 549; 8 Exch. 778.

Lamson v. Maryland Casualty Co., 196 Iowa 1185, 194 N.W.
70, 71. •

town v. Boyle, 212 Minn. 293, 4 N.W.2d 108, 109.

ditions of degree, or names of dignity, as knight, earl, mar-
quis, duke; additions of trade, mystery, or occupation, as
scrivener, painter, mason, carpenter; and additions of

Hen. V. c. 5, in cases where process of outlawry lies. In
all other cases it is only a description of the person, and
common reputation is sufficient; 2 Ld.Raym. 849.

## ADDITIONAL

equal, or reasonably proportioned, to the value of
that for which it is given. 1 Story, Eq.Jur. §§

## ADEQUATE PROVOCATION

An adequate prov-
ocation to cause a sudden transport of passion
that may suspend the exercise of judgment and
exclude premeditation and a previously formed
design is one that is calculated to excite such
anger as might obscure the reason or dominate
the volition of an ordinary reasonable man. Com-
monwealth v. Webb, 252 Pa. 187, 97 A. 189, 191.

## ADEQUATE REMEDY

plainant, to which he may at all times resort at

ing resort to mandamus, must not only be one placing re-

Conn. 542, 133 A. 683, 686. Must reach end intended, ane,
actually compel performance of duty in question. Bucha-
nan v. Buchanan, 124 Va. 255, 6 S.E.2d 612, 620. Must be
plain, accurate, certain, speedy, specific, and appropriate
to the particular circumstances, and must also be equally
as convenient, beneficial, and effective as the remedy by
mandamus. Simpson v. Williams Rural High School Dist.,

Any intentional act furthering hostile designs of enemies
of the United States, or an act which intentionally
strengthens or tends to strengthen enemies of the United
States, or which weakens or tends to weaken power of the
United States to resist and attack such enemies, constitutes
"adhering" to such enemies. United States v. Haupt, D.C.
Ill., 47 F.Supp. 836, 839.
Rebels, being citizens: are not "enemies," within the
meaning of the constitution; hence a conviction for trea-
son, in promoting a rebellion, cannot be sustained under
that branch of the constitutional definition which speaks of
"adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort."'
United States v. Greathouse, 2 Abb.U.S. 364, Fed.Cas.No.
15,254.

## ADHESION

The entrance of another state into
an existing treaty with respect only to a part of
the principles laid down or the stipulations agreed

Civ.App., 177 S.W.2d 231, 235.

## ADJECTIVE LAW

The aggregate of rules of
procedure or practice. As opposed to that body
of law which the courts are established to ad-
minister, (called "substantive law,") it means the
rules according to which the substantive law is
administered. That part of the law which pro-
vides a method for enforcing or maintaining

the deceased until some one is clothed with authority to
administer them, and cannot complain that another is ap-
pointed administrator in chief. Flora v. Mennice, 12 Ala.

80 P.2d 485, 487.

## ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCY

An agency of the
sovereign power charged with administering par-
ticular legislation. Examples are compensation
and industrial commissions, Joseph H. Weider-
hoff, Inc., v. Neal, D.C.Mo., 6 F.Supp. 798, 799;
Federal Trade Commission, Hastings Mfg. Co.
v. Federal Trade Commission, 153 F.2d 253, cer-

2d 957, 212 Ind. 329; and the like.

## ADMINISTRATIVE BOARD

The term is very
broad and includes bodies exercising varied func-
tions, some of which involve orders made or
other acts done ex parte or without full hearing
as to the operative facts, while others are done
only after such a notice and hearing, and the
functions of the former kind are plainly "admin-
istrative" and those of the latter are "quasi ju-
dicial". Beaverdale Memorial Park v. Danaher,
127 Conn. 175, 15 A.2d 17, 21.
"Administrative boards" differ from "courts" in that
boards frequently represent public interests entrusted to
boards, whereas courts are concerned with litigating
rights of parties with adverse interests. Rommell v.
Walsh, 15 A.2d 6, 9, 127 Conn. 16.

## ADMINISTRATIVE DISCRETION

"Administra-
tive discretion" means that the doing of acts or
things required to be done may rest, in part at
least, upon considerations not entirely susceptible
of proof or disproof and at times which consider-
ing the circumstances and subject-matter cannot
be supplied by the Legislature, and a statute con-
fers such discretion when it refers a commission
conferred. Culver v. Smith, Tex.Civ.App., 74 S.
W.2d 754, 757.

## ADMINISTRATIVE LAW

That branch of pub-
lic law which deals with the various organs of
the sovereign power considered as in motion, and
prescribes in detail the manner of their activity,
being concerned with such topics as the collection
of the revenue, the regulation of the military and
naval forces, citizenship and naturalization, sani-
tary measures, poor laws, coinage, police, the
public safety and morals, etc. See Holl.Jur. 305-
ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER. Politically and as
used in constitutional law, an officer of the execu-
tive department of government, and generally one

tive officer, as distinguished from a judicial offi-
cer. People v. Salsbury, 134 Mich. 537, 96 N.W.

a levee district. Board of Directors of St. Francis
Levee Dist. v. St. Louis-San Francisco Ry. Co.,

ADMINISTRATOR, in the most usual sense of
the word, is a person to whom letters of admin-
istration, that is, an authority to administer the
estate of a deceased person, have been granted
by the proper court. A representative of limited
authority, whose duties are to collect assets of
estate, pay its debts, and distribute residue to
those entitled. Smith v. White's Estate, 108 Vt.
473, 188 A. 901, 904. A technical trustee. In re
Watkins' Estate, Vt., 41 A.2d 180, 188.
He resembles an executor, but, being appointed
by the court, and not by the deceased, he has to
give security for the due administration of the
estate, by entering into a bond with sureties, call-
ed the administration bond. Smith v. Gentry, 16
Ga. 31; Collamore v. Wilder, 19 Kan. 78; Gorm-
ley v. Watson, 177 Ga. 763, 171 S.E. 280, 281.
By the law of Scotland the father is what is called
the "administrator-in-law" for his children. As such, he
is ipso jure their tutor while they are pupils, and their
curator during their minority. The father's power ex-
tends over whatever estate may descend to his children,
unless where that estate has been placed by the donor or
grantor under the charge of special trustees or managers.
This power in the father ceases by the child's discontinu-
ing to reside with him, unless he continues to live at the
father's expense; and with regard to dnu-hte-s, it ceases
on their marriage, the husband being the legal curator of
his wife. Bell.
A manager or conductor of affairs, especially
the affairs of another, in his name or behalf. A
manager of public affairs in behalf of others.

foreign state or country, where the decedent was
domiciled.
Public
An official provided for by statute in some states
to administer upon the property of intestates in
certain cases. See Rocca v. Thompson, 32 S.Ct.
207, 223 U.S. 317, 56 L.Ed. 453.

## ADMINISTRATOR CUM TESTAMENTO AN- NEXO

## ADMINISTRATOR DE BONIS NON

"Adminis-
trators de bonis non administratis" are, as the
term signifies, persons appointed by the court of
probate to administer on the effects of a decedent
which have not been included in a former admin-
istration. Paul v. Butler, 129 Kan. 244, 282 P.
732, 734.
Where will is set aside as void, administrator subse-
quently appointed is not "administrator de bonis non,"
but administrator of entire estate with power to attack
nominated executor's report. Douglas' Adm'r v. Douglas'
Ex'r, 48 S.W.2d 11, 14, 243 Ky. 321.

ADMIRALTY. A court which has a very exten-
sive jurisdiction of maritime causes, civil and
criminal, controversies arising out of acts done
upon or relating to the sea, and questions of
prize.
It is properly the successor of the consular courts, which
were emphatically the courts of merchants and sea-going
persons, established in the principal maritime cities on the
revival of commerce after the fall of the Western Empire,
to supply the want of tribunals that might decide causes
arising out of maritime commerce.
Also, the system of jurisprudence relating to
and growing out of the jurisdiction and practice
of the admiralty courts.
American Law

is limited to the ocean, navigable rivers running into the
ocean, and the Great Lakes and their connections. The
Frank G. Fobert, D.C.N.Y., 32 F.Supp. 214, 216.
The jurisdiction of the admiral, and the administration
of the admiralty law proper—the local maritime law—as
it became a judicial function, has passed into the hands of
the courts. Renew v. U. S., D.C.Ga., 1 F.Supp. 256, 259.
English Law
The court of the admiral, perhaps erected by
Edward III, 3 Bla.Comm. 69, or as early , as the

## ADMIRALTY, FIRST LORD OF THE

The nor-
mal head of the executive department of state
which presides over the naval forces of the king-
dom is the lord high admiral, but in practice the
functions of the great office are discharged by sev-
eral Lords Commissioners, of whom one, being
the chief, is called the "First Lord," and is a mem-
ber of the Cabinet. He is assisted by other lords,
called Sea Lords, and by various secretaries.

## ADMISSIBLE

Pertinent and proper to be con-
sidered in reaching a decision. Used with refer-
ence to the issues to be decided in any judicial

The order of a competent court or magistrate
that a person accused of crime be discharged from
actual custody upon the taking of bail. People v.
Admitting to bail is a judicial act to be performed by a
court or judicial officer, Trevathan v. Mutual Life Ins. Co.
of New York, 166 Or. 515, 113 P.2d 621, 624; and by "al-.
lowing bail" or "admitting to bail" is not meant the
formal justification, subscription, or acknowledgment by
the sureties, the term first mentioned relating to the order
determining that the offense is bailable and fixing the
amount of undertaking, and "taking the bail': meaning the
final acceptance or approval of it by the court. Clatsop
County v. Wuopio, 95 Or. 30, 186 P. 547.

## ADMISSIONS

Confessions, concessions or volun-
tary acknowledgments made by a party of the
existence of certain facts. Roosevelt v. Smith, 40
N.Y.S. 381, 17 Misc. 323. More accurately regard-
ed, they are statements by a party, or some one
identified with him in legal interest, of the ex-
istence of a fact which is relevant to the cause of
his adversary. Brooks v. Sessoms, 171 S.E. 222,
223, 47 Ga.App. 554. They are against the interest
of the party making them. Little Fay Oil Co. v.
Stanley, 90 Okl. 265, 217 P. 377, 378.
It is not essential that an "admission" be contrary to
interest of party at time it is made; it is enough if it be
inconsistent with position which party takes either in
pleadings or at trial. Harvey v. Provandie, 83 N.H. 236,
141 A. 136, 140.
The term "admission" is usually applied to civil trans-
actions and to those matters of fact in criminal cases which
do not involve criminal intent, while the term "confession"
is generally restricted to acknowledgments of guilt. Peo-
ple v. Sourisseau, 62 Cal.App.2d 917, 145 P.2d 916, 923.
State v. Lindsey, 26 N.M. 526, 194 P. 877, 878.
An "admission" as applied in criminal cases is
the avowal of a fact or of circumstances from
which guilt may be inferred, but only tending to
prove the offense charged, and not amounting to
a confession of guilt. Theis v. State, Ga., 164 S.
E. 456, 457. A statement by defendant. of fact or
facts pertinent to issues tending, in connection
with proof of other facts or circumstances, to
prove guilt, but which is, of itself, insufficient to
authorize conviction. Commonwealth v. Elliott,
292 Pa. 16, 140 A. 537, 538. Does not include
statements which are part of the res gestw. State
v. Clark, 102 Mont. 432, 58 P.2d 276, 278.
Direct, called also express, admissions are those which
are made in direct terms.
Implied admissions are those which result from some act
or failure to act of the party. Part payment of a debt is an
admission of liability to pay debt. Hart v. Deshong, Del.,
1 Terry 218, 8 A.2d 85, 87. Defendants' failure to specifi-
cally deny their signatures to notes, "admission" that they
signed the acknowledgments. Haas v. Johnson, 203 La.
697, 14 So.2d 606, 608. Undenied accusations were implied
"admission". State v. Postal, 215 Minn. 427, 10 N.W.2d
373, 378.
Incidental admissions are those made in some other con-
nection, or involved in the admission of some other fact.
Judicial admissions are those made in court by a per-
son's attorney for the purpose of being used as a substitute
for the regular legal evidence of the facts at the trial.
Martin v. State, 46 Okl.Cr. 411, 287 P. 424. Such as are
made voluntarily by a party, which appear of record in the
proceedings of the court. Formal acts done by a party or
his attorney in court on the trial of a cause for the purpose
of dispensing with proof by the opposing party of some
fact claimed by the latter to be true. Wiley v. Rutland R.
Co., 86 Vt. 504, 86 A. 808, 810. Concession by defendant
that she had executed a bill of sale for the automobile to
intervener to secure an indebtedness was an "admission
in judicio" by defendant against her title to the automo-
bile. McDay v. Long, 63 Ga.App. 421, 11 S.E.2d 395, 399.
But opening statements of counsel are not, technically,
"admissions." Wilkey v. State ex rel. Smith, 238 Ala. 595,
192 So. 588, 591. See Acquiescence; Quasi-Admissions;
True Admission.
Pleading
The acknowledgment or recognition by one par-
ty of the truth of some matter alleged by the
opposite party, made in a pleading, the effect of
which is to narrow the area of facts or allegations
required to be proved by evidence. Connecticut
Hospital v. Brookfield, 69 Conn. 1, 36 A. 1017.
An allegation not denied is deemed not controverted, and
silence of pleader is usually treated as an admission
against him for purpose of the action. Doughty v. Pallis-
sard, 3 N.Y.S.2d 452, 453, 167 Misc. 55. Generally plead-
ings must be regarded as "judicial admissions", rather
than ordinary "admissions". Hughes v. Fort Worth Nat.
Bank, Tex.Civ.App., 164 S.W.2d 231, 232.
In confession and avoidance, admission of truth of op-
posite party's pleading is made.
Express admissions may be made of matters of fact only.
See Confession and Avoidance.
In Equity. Partial admissions are those which are de-
livered in terms of uncertainty, mixed up with explanatory
or qualifying circumstances.
Plenary admissions are those which admit the truth of
the matter without qualification, whether it be asserted
as from information and belief or as from actual knowl-
edge. See Burrell v. Hackley, C.C.N.Y., 35 F. 833.
"Admissions against interest" are any state-
ments made by or attributable to a party to an
action, which constitute admissions against his
interest and tend to establish or disprove any ma-
terial fact in the case. Kellner v. Whaley, 148
Neb. 259, 27 N.W.2d 183, 189.

## ADMIT

To allow, receive, or take; to suffer one

against danger of an offense. Ft. Smith Light &
Traction Co. v. Hendrickson, 126 Ark. 377, 189 S.
W. 1064, 1067.

## ADMONITION

A reprimand from a judge to a
person accused, on being discharged, warning him
of the consequences of his conduct, and intimating
to him that, should he be guilty of the same fault
for which he has been admonished, he will be
punished with greater severity. Merlin, Repert.
The admonition was authorized as a species of
punishment for slight misdemeanors. In eccle-
siastical law, this is the lightest form of punish-
ment.
Any authoritative oral communication or state-
ment by way of advice or caution by the court to
the jury respecting their duty or conduct as jurors;
the admissibility or nonadmissibility of evidence,

To adopt a route for the transportation of the mail

transported over that route. Rhodes v. U. S., Dev.Ct.C1.
47. To adopt a contract is to accept it as binding, notwith-
standing some defect which entitles the party to repudiate
it. Thus, when a person affirms a voidable contract, or
ratifies a contract made by his agent beyond his authority,
he is sometimes said to adopt it. Sweet. Strictly, how-
ever, the word "adopt" should be used to apply to void
transactions, while the word "ratify" should be limited to
the final approval of a voidable transaction by one who
theretofore had the optional right to relieve himself from
its obligations. United German Silver Co. v. Bronson, 92
Conn. 266, 102 A. 647, 648. "Adoption" of a contract by one
not a party thereto is of the nature of a novation. Edwards
v. Heralds of Liberty, 263 Pa. 548, 107 A. 324, 326. See Af-
firm.

eration; as in the case of a constitution, constitu-
tional amendment, ordinance, or by-law. Real v.

(N.Y.) 191. A Code. City of Albany v. Nix, 21
Ala.App. 164, 106 So. 199, 200. Statements in an
application appearing above insured's signature.
Republic Mut. Ins. Co. v. Wilson, 66 Ohio App.. 522,
35 N.E.2d 467, 468.
To take into one's family the child of another
and give him or her the rights, privileges, and
duties of a child and heir. State v. Thompson,
13 La.Ann. 515; Abney v. De Loach, 84 Ala. 393.
Adoption of children was a thing unknown to the com-
mon law, but was a familiar practice under the Roman law
and in those countries where the civil law prevails, as
France and Spain. Butterfield v. Sawyer, 187 Ill. 598, 58
N.E. 602, 52 L.R.A. 75, 79 Am.St.Rep. 246. Creature of the
law, and statutory requirements must be strictly carried

145 F.2d 656, 659. The act of one who takes an-
other's child into his own family, treating him as
his own, and giving him all the rights and duties
of his own child. See In re Chambers' Estate, 183
N.Y.S. 526, 528, 112 Misc. 551. in manner provided
s
by and with consequences specified in statute.
Fisher v. Robison, 329 Pa. 305, 198 A. 81, 82. A.
juridicial act creating between two persons cer-
tain relations, purely civil, of paternity and filia-
tion. 6 Demol. § 1; Grimes v. Grimes, 207 N.C.
778, 178 S.E. 573. The relation thereby created is
a statutory status, not a contractual relation.
Caruso v. Caruso, 13 N.Y.S.2d 239, 241, 175 Misc.
290. Though legal adoption may confer on per-
son adopted rights of actual relationship of child,
simple "adoption" extends only to his treatment
as member of the household. Shepherd v. Sov-
ereign Camp, W.O.W., 166 Va. 488, 186 S.E. 113,
116. See, also, Adopt.
Adoption, properly speaking, refers only to persons who
are strangers in blood, In re Lund's Estate, Cal.App., 148
P.2d 709, 711. And is not synonymous with "legitimation,"
which refers to persons of the same blood. Blythe v.
Ayres, 96 Cal. 532, 31 P. 915, 19 L.R.A. 40. But this dis-
tinction is not always observed. In re Presly's Estate, 113
Okl. 160, 240 P. 89, 90. It is a relationship artificially cre-
ated by statute. Borner v. Larson, 70 N. D. 313, 293 N.W.
836, 839.
ADOPTION BY PUBLIC ACKNOWLEDGMENT.

An agreement to "advance" money for personal property
implies a loan with property as pledge, rather than a pay-
ment of purchase money in sale. Shelley v. Byers, 73 Cal.

## ADVANCE PAYMENT

ter circumstance which differentiates an advance-
ment from a gift or a loan. Brewer's Adm'r v.

732, 734; but which must be accounted for by donee on
distribution of donor's estate. In re Beier's Estate, 205
Minn. 43, 284 N.W. 833, 835, 836, 837, 838. "Advancement,"
unlike "ademption" (q. v.), applies only to cases of in-
testacy. Ellard v. Ferris, 91 Ohio St. 339, 110 N.E. 476, 479.
An "advancement by portion," within the meaning of the
statute, is a sum given by a parent to establish a child in

sion for the child, (as on the marriage of a daughter). L.
R. 20 Eq. 155. See Ademption; Gift.

## ADVANCES

modities furnished on credit; a loan or gift, or

der Co. v. Burkhardt, 97 U.S. 110, 24 L.Ed. 973.
mean gifts, (advancements,) and does mean a sort of loan;
and, when taken in its ordinary and usual sense, it in-
cludes both loans and gifts,—loans more readily, perhaps,
than gifts. Landrum & Co. v. Wright, 11 Ala.App. 406, 66
So. 892.
Payments advanced to the owner of property
by a factor or broker on the price of goods which
the latter has in his hands, or is to receive, for
sale.
"Loans" are repayable at maturity, while "advances"
are not repaid by party receiving them, but are covered
by proceeds of consigned goods. People ex rel. James Tal-
bott, Inc., v. Goldfogle, 211 N.Y.S. 122, 123, 213 App.Div.

stance, opportunity, or means specially favorable

166 N.E. 603, 604. Preference or priority. United
States v. Preston, 4 Wash. 446, Fed.Cas.No.16,087.

ly, fortuitously, or out of the regular course.

Co. v. State Board of Assessors, 49 N.J.Law, 1, 7
A. 306.

## ADVENTITIUS

Lat. Fortuitous; incidental;
coming from an unusual source. Adventitia bona
are goods which fall to a man otherwise than by
inheritance. Adventitia dos is a dowry or portion
given by some friend other than the parent.

## ADVENTURA

An adventure. 2 Mon.Angl. 615;
Townsh.Pl. 50. Flotson, jetson, and lagon are
styled adventurce maris, (adventures of the sea.)
Hale, De Jure Mar. pt. 1, c. 7.

## ADVENTURE

A hazardous and striking enter-
prise, a bold undertaking in which hazards are to
be met and issue hangs upon unforeseen events.
Bond v. O'Donnell, 205 Iowa, 902, 218 N.W. 898,
902, 63 A.L.R. 901.
Generally
Adventure, bill of. In mercantile law, a writing
signed by a merchant, stating that the property
in goods shipped in his name belongs to another,
to the adventure or chance of which the person
so named is to stand, with a covenant from the
merchant to account to him for the produce.
Gross adventure. In maritime law, a loan on
bottomry. So named because the lender, in case
safety, must contribute to the gross or general
average.
Joint adventure. A commercial or maritime en-
terprise undertaken by 'several persons jointly;
a limited partnership,—not limited in the statu-
tory sense as to the liability of the partners, but
as to its scope and duration. Lobsitz v. E. Liss-
berger Co., 168 App.Div. 840, 154 N.Y.S. 556, 557.
A special partnership. McDaniel v. State Fair of
Texas, Tex.Civ.App., 286 S.W. 513, 517. An as-
sociation of two or more persons to carry out a
single business enterprise for profit, for which
purpose they combine their property, money, ef-
fects, skill, and knowledge. Forman v. Lumm,
214 App.Div. 579, 212 N.Y.S. 487. A special com-
bination of two or more persons, where, in some
specific adventure, a profit is jointly sought, with-
out any actual partnership or corporate designa-
tion. Griffin v. Reilly, Tex.Civ.App., 275 S.W. 242,
It is ordinarily, but not necessarily, limited to a single
transaction, Forbes v. Butler, 66 Utah, 373, 242 P. 950, 956,
which serves to distinguish it from a partnership, Barry
v. Kern, 184 Wis. 266, 199 N.W. 77, 78. But the business of
conducting it to a successful termination may continue for
a number of years. Elliott v. Murphy Timber Co., 117 Or.
387, 244 P. 91, 93, 48 A.L.R. 1043. There is no real dis-
tinction between a "joint adventure" and what is termed
a "partnership for a single transaction." Atlas Realty Co.
v. Galt, 153 Md. 586, 139 A. 285, 286. A "joint adventure,"
while not identical with a partnership, is so similar in its
nature and in the relations created thereby that the rights
of the parties as between themselves are governed practi-
cally by the same rules that govern partnerships. Goss v.
Lanin, 170 Iowa 57, 152 N.W. 43, 45.
Marine Insurance
A very usual word in policies of marine insur-
ance, and everywhere used as synonymous, or
nearly so, with "perils." It is often used by the
writers to describe the enterprise or voyage as a
"marine adventure" insured against. Moores v.
Louisville Underwriters, C.C.Tenn., 14 Fed. 233.

cargo or other agent, at the risk of the sender,

## ADVENTURER

One who undertakes uncertain
or hazardous actions or enterprises. It is also
used to denote one who seeks to advance his

credulity of others. It has been held that to im-
pute that a person is an adventurer is a libel; 18
L.J.C.P. 241.

opposition to a claim, application, or proceeding.

In re National Lock Co., D.C.Ill., 9 F.Slipp. 432,
As to adverse "Claim," "Enjoyment," "User,"
"Verdict," "Witness," see those titles.

## ADVERSE INTEREST

The "adverse interest"
of a witness, so as to permit cross-examination by
the party calling him, must be so involved in the
event of the suit that a legal right or liability will
be acquired, lost, or materially affected by the
judgment, and must be such as would be pro-
moted by the success of the adversary of the par-
ty calling him. Dinger v. Friedman, 279 Pa. 8,
123 A. 641, 643. On petition in bankruptcy court
for removal of trustee's attorney, attorney has an
interest adverse to trustee. In re Mallow Hotel
Corporation, D.C.Pa., 18 F.Supp. 15, 17.

## ADVERSE PARTY

An "adverse party" entitled
to notice of appeal is every party whose interest
in relation to the judgment or decree appealed
from is in conflict with the modification or rever-
sal sought by the appeal.
Every party interested in sustaining the judgment or
decree. Harrigan v. Gilchrist, 121 Wis. 127, 99 N.W. 909.
All parties appearing against losing party unless reversal
of case will not be to party's detriment. Shea v. Shea,
Iowa, 264 N.W. 590. Any party who would be prejudi-
cially affected by a modification or reversal of the judg-
ment appealed from. Great Falls Nat. Bank v. Young, 67
Mont. 328, 215 P. 651, 652. One who has interest in oppos-
ing object sought to be accomplished by appeal. In re
Baxter's Estate, 94 Mont. 257, 22 P.2d 182. Party to rec-
ord, whose interest in subject-matter of appeal is adverse
to, reversal or modification of judgment or order appealed
from. MacDonald v. Superior Court in and for City and
County of San Francisco, 101 Cal.App. 423, 281 P. 672, 673.
A party who, by the pleadings, is arrayed on the opposite
side. Merrill v. St. Paul City Ry. Co., 170 Minn. 332, 212
N.W. 533. The other party to the action. Highland v.
Hines, 80 N.H. 179, 116 A. 347, 349. A party to the record
for, or against, whom judgment is sought. Merchants'
Supply Co. v. Hughes' Ex'rs, 139 Va. 212, 123 S.E. 355, 356.
"Opposite" party synonymous. In re Wah-shah-she-me-
tsa-he's Estate, 111 Okl. 177, 239 P. 177, 178. And term is
not necessarily confined to plaintiffs as against defendants,
or vice versa. Arwood v. Hill's Adm'rs, 135 Va. 235, 117
S.E. 603, 605. But a defaulting defendant is not an
"adverse party" ; Holt v. Empey, 32 Idaho, 106, 178 P.
703; nor is one who is named as a party but is not served;
Kissler v. Moss, 26 Idaho, 516, 144 P. 647. Compare Fer-
gen v. Lonie, 50 S.D. 328, 210 N.W. 102, 103 (garnishment
debtor not served in garnishment proceeding).

## ADVERSE POSSESSION

A method of acquisi-
tion of title by possession for a statutory period
under certain conditions. Lowery v. Garfield
County, Mont., 208 P.2d 478, 486. It has been de-
scribed as the statutory method of acquiring title
to land by limitation. Field v. Sosby, Tex.Civ.
App., 226 S.W.2d 484, 486.
The possession must be actual, Ortiz v. Pacific
States Properties, Cal.App., 215 P.2d 514, 516;
289 Ky. 244; under claim of right, Thomas v
Durchslag, Ill., 90 N.E.2d 200, 204, 404 Ill. 581
continuous, Davis v. Federal Land Bank of Col
umbia, 13 S.E.2d 417, 419, 219 N.Car. 248; ope
Wilberforce University v. College of Ed. an
Indus. Arts at Wilberforce University, 90 N.E.2
172, 173, 86 Ohio App. 121; notorious, Edie v
Coleman, 141 S.W.2d 238, 242, 243, 235 Mo.Ap
1289; exclusive, Laudati v. State, 30 N.Y.S.2d 267
270, and -hostile, Singley v. Dempsey, 42 So.2d 609
612, 252 Ala. 677. Although color of title is no
essential, Roesch v. Gerst, 138 P.2d 846, 851, 852
18 Wash.2d 294, it is of great evidentiary valu
in establishing adverse possession, Lincoln v
Mills, 2 So.2d 809, 811, 191 Miss. 512.
Adverse possession depends on intent of occu
pant to claim and hold real property in oppositio
to all the world, Sertic v. Roberts, 136 P.2d 248
171 Ore. 121; and also embodies the idea that own
er of or persons interested in property have knowl
edge of the assertion of ownership by the occu
pant, Field v. Sosby, Tex.Civ.App., 226 S.W.2d 484
Payment of taxes alone is not sufficient in it
self to establish adverse possession, Blitch v
Sapp, 194 So. 328, 330, 142 Fla. 166. It is manda
tory that the element of continuous possessio
exist for the full statutory period, Wells v. Tietge
9 N.W.2d 180, 182, 143 Neb. 230.

## ADVERSUS

In the civil law, against, (contra.
Adversus bonos mores, against good morals. Dig
47, 10, 15.
Adversus extraneos vitiosa possessio prodess
solet. Prior possession is a good title of owner
ship against all who cannot show a better. D
41. 2. 53; Salmond, Jurispr. 638.

It includes publication by hand bills, signs, bill board
sound trucks and radio, Rust v. Missouri Dental Board
348 Mo. 616, 155 S.W.2d 80, 83; or in a newspaper, or b
means of placards, or other written public notices ; Nichol
v. Nichols, 192 Ala. 206, 68 So. 186, 187. It is merely iden
tification and description, apprising of quality and plac
Rast v. Van Deman & Lewis Co., 240 U.S. 342, 36 S.Ct. 37
377, 60 L.Ed. 679. And "advertising purposes" are n
limited to matters of vocation, or even avocation, b
include advertisements essentially for unselfish purpose

App.Div. 230.

designed to attract public attention. Edwards v
Lubbock County, Tex., 33 S.W.2d 482, 484. Info
mation communicated to the public, or to an i
dividual concerned, as by handbills or the news
paper. First Nat. Corporation v. Perrine, 9
Mont. 454, 43 P.2d 1073, 1077.
giving notice that lottery tickets are for sale, Com. v.
Hooper, 5 Pick.Mass. 42.
ADVERTISEMENTS OF QUEEN ELIZABETH.
Certain articles or ordinances drawn up by Arch-
bishop Parker and some of the bishops in 1564, at
the request of Queen Elizabeth, the object of
which was to enforce decency and uniformity in
. the ritual of the church. The queen subsequently
refused to give her official sanction to these ad-
vertisements, and left them to be enforced by the
bishops under their general powers. Phillim.Ecc.
Law, 910; 2 Prob.Div. 276; 354.

lawyers to their clients; an opinion expressed as
• to wisdom of future conduct. Hughes v. Van
Bruggen, 44 N.M. 534, 105 P.2d 494, 496.
The word has several different meanings, among others,
as follows : Information or notice given; intelligence ;—
usually information communicated by letter ;—Chiefly as
to drafts or bills of exchange ; as, a letter of advice.—
Advice implies real or pretended knowledge, often pro-
fessional or technical, on the part of the one who gives it.
Provident Trust Co. v. National Surety Co., D.C.Pa., 44
F.Supp. 514, 515.
The instruction usually given by one merchant
or banker to another by letter, informing him of
shipments made to him, or of bills or „drafts
drawn on him, with particulars of date, or sight,
the sum, and the payee. Bills presented for ac-
ceptance or payment are frequently dishonored
for want of advice.
Letter of advice is a communication from one person to
another, advising or warning the latter of something which
he ought to know, and commonly apprising him before-
hand of some act done by the writer which will ultimately
affect the recipient. Chit. Bills, 162.

## JEQUITAS

In the civil law, equity, as opposed
to strictum or summum jus, (q. v.). Otherwise
called cequum, cequum bonum, cequum et bonum,
cequum et justum. Calvin.
Referring to the use of this term, Prof. Gray says
(Nature and Sources of the Law 290) : "Austin and Maine
take cequitas as having an analogous meaning to equity ;
.
they apply the term to those rules which the prwtors intro-
duced through the Edict in modification of the jus civile,
but it seems to be an error to suppose that cequitas had
this sense in the Roman Law." He quotes Prof. Clark
(Jurisprudence 367) as doubting "whether cequitas is ever
clearly used by the Roman jurists to indicate simply a
department of Law" and expresses the opinion that an
examination of the authorities more than justifies his
doubt. iEquitas is opposed to' strictum jus and varies in
meaning between reasonable modification of the letter and
substantial justice. It is to be taken as a frame of mind
in dealing with legal questions and not as a source of law.
See JEquum et Bonum.
ZEquitas agit in personam. Equity acts upon the
person. 4 Bouv.Inst. n. 3733.
2Equitas est correctio legis generaliter latx, qua
parte deficit. Equity is the correction of that
wherein the law, by reason of its generality, is

ZEquitas est correctio qudam legi adhibita, quia

correction applied to law, because on account of
its general comprehensiveness, without an excep-
tion, something is absent from it. Plowd. 467.
lEquitas est perfecta qudam ratio quajus scrip-
turn interpretatur et emendat; nulla scriptura
comprehensa, sed solum in vera ratione consistens.
Equity is a certain perfect reason, which inter-
prets and amends the written law, comprehended
in no writing, but consisting in right reason alone.
Co.Litt. 24b.
27-Equitas est quasi aequalitas. Equity is as it were
equality; equity is a species of equality or equali-
zation. .Co.Litt. 24.
ZEquitas ignorantiie opitulatur, oscitanthe non
item. Equity assists ignorance, but not careless-
ness.
Xquitas non facit jus, sed juri auxiliatur. Eq-

involved in cequum et bonum' or `cequitas' is iden-
tical with what we mean by 'reasonable' or nearly
SO.
"On the whole, the natural justice or 'reason of the
thing' which the common law recognizes and applies does
not appear to differ from the 'law of nature' which the
Romans identified with jus gentium, and the medieval
doctors of the civil and common law boldly adopted as
being divine law revealed through man's natural reason."
Sir F. Pollock, Expans. of C. L. 111, citing [1902] 2 Ch.
661, where jus naturale and cequum et bonum were taken

## AFFECTED WITH A PUBLIC INTEREST

Af-
firmatively, phrase means that a business or prop-
erty must be sun or be so employed as to justify
the conclusion that it has been devoted to a pub-
lic use, and its use thereby in effect granted to
the public. Negatively, it does not mean that a
business is affected with a public interest merely
because it is large or because the public are war-
ranted in having a feeling of concern in respect
of its maintenance. H. Earl Clack Co. v. Public
Service Commission of State of Montana, 94 Mont.
488, 22 P.2d 1056.
A business given a virtual monopoly in its field or where
the public adapt their business or conduct to the methods
used by it. Western Buse Telephone Co. v. Northwestern
Bell Telephone Co., 188 Minn. 524, 248 N.W. 220, 229. The
business must affect the prosperity of a large part of file
members of the body politic. Ex parte Kazas, 22 Cal.App.
2d 161, 70 P.2d 962, 967. This phrase means something
more than "quasi public," or "not strictly private," and
similar phrases employed as a basis for upholding police
regulations. A business is not affected with a public inter-
est merely because the public derives benefit, accommoda-
tion, ease or enjoyment from its existence or operation,
such as admissions to places of amusement or entertain-
ment. Tyson & Bro.-United Theatre Ticket Offices v. Ban-
ton, 273 U.S. 418, 47 S.Ct. 426, 429, 71 L.Ed. 718, 58 A.L.R.
Businesses. Three classes of such businesses : (1) Those
carried on under the authority of a public grant or privi-
lege expressly or impliedly imposing an affirmative duty of
rendering public service demanded by the public, such as
common carriers and public utilities ; (2) occupations
regarded as exceptional, the public interest attaching to
which has been recognized from earliest times and has sur-
vived the period of arbitrary laws by Parliament or colo-
nial legislatures for regulating trades and callings, such as
inns, cabs, and grist mills ; (3) businesses which, though
not public at their inception, have become such by devot-
ing their business to a public use, thereby granting the
public an interest in that use and subjecting themselves to
public regulation to extent of that interest, although the
property continues to belong to its private owner, and to
be entitled to protection accordingly, as public warehouses
133, 138.

thize with; to consort with; and to connect or associate

be said to be affiliated. People v. Horiuchi, 114 Cal.App.
415, 300 P. 457, 460.

## AFFILIATION

Imports less than membership
in an organization, but more than sympathy, and
a working alliance to bring to fruition the pro-
scribed program of a proscribed organization, as
distinguished from mere co-operation with a pro-
- scribed organization in lawful activities, is es-
sential. Bridges v. Wixon, Cal., 326 U.S. 135, 65
S.Ct. 1443, 1447, 89 L.Ed. 2103.
It includes an element of dependability upon which the
organization can rely which, though not equivalent to
membership duty, rests upon course of conduct that could

one who has knowledge of a crime) ; Calvinus, Lex.

sanguinity nor affinity. Davidson v. Whitehill, 87
Vt. 499, 89 A. 1081, 1085. This term signifies the
connection between the kinsmen of the two per-
sons married, as, for example, the husband's
brother and the wife's sister. Erskine, Inst. 1. 6. 8.

## AFFINITY

A close agreement; relation; spir-
itual relation or attraction held to exist between

one spouse because of marriage has to blood rela-
tives of the other. State v. Hooper, 140 Kan. 481,
37 P.2d 52.
Degrees of relationship by affinity are computed as are
degrees of relationship by consanguinity. The doctrine of
affinity grew out of the canonical maxim that marriage
makes husband and wife one. The husband has the same
relation, by affinity, to his wife's blood relatives as she has
to them by consanguinity and vice versa. State v. Hooper,
140 Kan. 481, 37 P.2d 52.
Affinity is distinguished into three kinds : (1) Direct, or
that subsisting between the husband and his wife's rela-
tions by blood, or between the wife and the husband's rela-
tions by blood; (2) secondary, or that which subsists
between the husband and his wife's relations by marriage ;
(3) collateral, or that which subsists between the husband
and the relations of his wife's relations. Wharton.
In a larger sense, consanguinity or kindred.

tween two persons, one of whom has been be-
trothed to a kinsman of the other, but who have

In the practice of appellate courts, to affirm a judgment,
decree, or order, is to declare that it is valid and right,

it; to concur in its correctness and confirm its efficacy.
Boner v. Fall River County Bank, 25 Wyo. 260, 168 P. 726,

late court of a judgment, order, or decree of a
lower court brought before it for review. See Af-
firm, note.
The ratification or confirmation of a voidable
contract or act by the party who is to be bound
thereby.
The term is in accuracy to be distinguished from ratifi-
cation, which is a recognition of the validity or binding
force as against the party ratifying, of some act performed
by another person; and from confirmation, which would
seem to apply more properly to cases where a doubtful
authority has been exercised by another in behalf of the
person ratifying; but these distinctions are not generally
observed with much care.

## AFFIRMANCE DAY GENERAL

In the English
court of exchequer, a day appointed by the judges
of the common pleas, and barons of the exche-

tions which are affirmed, instead of sworn to in
place of the word "deponent."

The [burden of] proof lies upon
him who affirms, not upon one who denies. Steph.
Pl. 84.

## AFFIRMANTIS EST PROBARE

115 Mich. 601, 73 N.W. 889. The term is one which
is employed to describe an assault which has, in
addition to the mere intent to commit it, another
object which is also criminal, Brimhall v. State,
31 Ariz. 522, 255 P. 165, 53 A.L.R. 231; or to in-
clude all those species of assault which, for vari-
ous reasons, have come to be regarded as more
heinous than common assault, State v. Jones, 133
S.C. 167, 130 S.E. 747; or which have been made

the commission of a crime or tort which increase
its guilt or enormity or adds to its injuriou
consequences, but which is above and beyond th
essential constituents of the crime or tort itself.
Matter of aggravation, correctly understood, does no
consist in acts of the same kind and description as thos
constituting the gist of the action, but in something don
by the defendant, on the occasion of committing the tres
pass, which is, to some extent, of a different legal char
acter from the principal act complained of. Hathaway v
Rice, 19 Vt. 107. So on an indictment for murder the pris
oner may be convicted of manslaughter, for the avermen
of malice aforethought is merely matter of aggravation

## AGNATI

In Roman law, the term included all
the cognates who trace their connection exclusive-
ly through males.
A table of cognates is formed by taking each lineal
ancestor in turn and including all his descendants of both
sexes in the tabular view. If, then, in tracing the various
branches of such a genealogical table or tree, we stop
whenever we come to the name of a female, and pursue
that particular branch or ramification no further, all who
remain after the descendants of women have been excluded
are agnates, and their connection together is agnatic rela-
tionship. Maine, Anc. Law, 142.
All persons are agnatically connected together who
are under the same patria potestas, or who have been
under it, or who might have been under it if their lineal
ancestor had lived long enough to exercise his empire.
Maine, Anc. Law, 144.
same time, who would have been subject to the patris
potestas of a common ancestor, if his life had been con-
tinued to their time. Hadl.Rom.Law, 131.
Cognates were all persons who could trace their blood to
a single ancestor or ancestress, and agnates were those
cognates who traced their connection exclusively through
males. Maine, Anc. Law. Between agnati and cognati
there is this difference : that, under the name of agnati,
cognati are included, but not 6 converso; for instance, a
father's brother, that is, a paternal uncle, is both agnatus
and cognatus, but a mother's brother, that is, a maternal
uncle, is a cognatus but not agnatus. (Dig. 38, 7, 5, pr.)

title, property, or right, to part voluntarily with owner-
ship of property, and, in widest sense, property is alien-
ated when transferred from one person to another in any
way; but generally alienating is restricted to transfer of
title to property by act of owner, as distinguished from

It does not partake of nature of damages or penalty for
husband's misconduct. Kennard v. Kennard, 87 N.H. 320,

tion. Floyd v. Floyd, 91 Fla. 910, 108 So. 896, 898.
Alimony in gross, or in a lump sum, is in the
nature of a final property settlement, and hence
in some jurisdictions is not included in the term
"alimony," which in its strict or technical sense
contemplates money payments at regular inter-
vals. Parmly v. Parmly, 125 N.J.Eq. 545, 5 A.2d

## ALL THE MEMBERS

The provision of a church
constitution that "all the members" can discharge
their parish priest means that all shall have op-

A material allegation in a pleading is one es-
sential to the claim or defense.
In ecclesiastical law, the statement of the facts
intended to be relied on in support of the con-
tested suit.
In English ecclesiastical practice the word seems to
designate the pleading as a whole ; the three pleadings are

allegation, and the complainant's reply as the rejoining
allegation.

49 F.Supp. 407, 414.
The citizen or subject owes an absolute and permanent
allegiance to his government or sovereign until he becomes
a citizen or subject of another government or another sov-
ereign. The alien owes a local and temporary allegiance
during period of his residence. U. S. v. Wong Kim, Ark.,
169 U.S. 649, 18 Sup.Ct. 456, 42 L.Ed. 890.
"The tie or ligamen which binds the subject [or citizen]
to the king [or government] in return for that protection
which the king [or government] affords the subject, [or
citizen."] 1 Bl.Comm. 366. It consists in "a true and
faithful obedience of the subject due to his sovereign," 7
Coke, 4b, and is a comparatively modern corruption of

of allegiance which is due from all men born with-
in the king's dominions, immediately upon their
birth, which is intrinsic and perpetual, and- cannot
be divested by any act of their own. 1 Bl.Comm.
369; 2 Kent, Comm. 42. In American law, the al-
legiance due from citizens of the United States
to their native country, and also from naturalized
citizens, and which cannot be renounced without
the permission of government, to be declared by
law. 2 Kent, Comm. 43-49.
It is said to be due to the king in his political, not his
personal, capacity; L. R. 17 Q. B. D. 54, quoted in U. S.
v. Wong Kim, Ark., 169 U.S. 663, 18 Sup.Ct. 456, 42 L.Ed.
890; and so in the United States "it is a political obliga-
tion" depending not on ownership of land, but on the
enjoyment of the protection of government; Wallace v.
Harmstad, 44 Pa. 492; and it "binds the citizen to the
observance of all laws" of his own sovereign; Adams v.
People, 1 N.Y. 173.

S.Ct. 154, 41 L.Ed. 528, wherein the instruction was
approved. Coupe v. United States, 72 App.D.C. 86,

407, 411. Some other thing; including; further;
furthermore; in the same manner; moreover;
nearly the same as the word "and" or "likewise."
Schilling v. Central California Traction Co., 1 P.
2d 53, 55, 115 Cal.App. 30.
The word imports no more than "item" and may mean
the same as "moreover" ; but not the same as "in like
manner" ; Evans v. Knorr, 4 Rawle (Pa.) 68; nor is it
synonymous with "other," City of Ft. Smith v. Gunter,
106 Ark. 371, 154 S.W. 181, 183. It may be (1) the begin-
ning of an entirely different sentence, or (2) a copulative
carrying on the sense of the immediately preceding words
into those immediately succeeding. Stroud, Jud. Dict.,
citing 1 Jarm. 497 n. ; 1 Salk. 239; Security State Bank v.
Jones, 121 Kan. 396, 247 P. 862, 863.

Alter, the other; the opposite party; the defend-
er. 1 Broun, 336, note.

## ALTA PRODITIO

L. Lat. In old English law,

## ALTA VIA

L. Lat. In old English law, a high-
way; the highway. 1 Salk. 222. Alta via regia;
the king's highway; "the king's high street."
Finch, Law, b. 2, c. 9.

## ALTARAGE

In ecclesiastical law, offerings
made on the altar; all profits which accrue to
the priest by means of the altar. Ayliffe, Parerg.

## ALTENHEIM

er, 70 N.J.Eq. 192, 63 A. 835.

## ALTER

To make a change in; to modify; to
vary in some degree; to change some of the ele-
ments or ingredients or details without substitut-
ing an entirely new thing or destroying the iden-
tity of the thing affected. Davis v. Campbell, 93
Iowa, 524, 61 N.W. 1053. To change partially.
Cross v. Nee, D.C.Mo., 18 F.Supp. 589, 594. To
change in one or more respects, but without de-
struction of existence or identity of the thing
changed; to increase or diminish. Kraus v.
Kraus, 301 I1l.App. 606, 22 N.E.2d 862. See Al-
teration; Change.
To change may import the substitution of an entirely
different thing, while to alter is to operate upon a subject-
matter which continues objectively the same while modi-
fied in some particular. To "amend" implies that the
modification made in the subject improves it, which is not
necessarily the case with an alteration. See Ex parte Woo
Jan, D.C.Ky., 228 F. 927, 940.
But "alter" is sometimes used synonymously with
"change," Board of Sup'rs of Yavapai County v. Stephens,
20 Ariz. 115, 177 P. 261, 264, and with "enlarge," City of
Jamestown v. Pennsylvania Gas Co., C.C.A.N.Y., 1 F.2d
871, 883.
The other; the opposite party. See Alt,
ALTER EGO. Second self. 3 C.J.S. Alter Ego.
Theory that subordinate or servient corporation may be
controlled by superior or dominant corporation, so that
dominant corporation may be held liable for subordinate
corporation's negligence. Barnes v. Liebig, 146 Fla. 219, 1
So.2d 247, 253.
To establish the "alter ego" doctrine, it must be shown
that the stockholders disregarded the entity of the corpo-
ration, made corporation a mere conduit for the transac-
tion of their own private business, and that the separate
individualities of the corporation and its stockholders in
fact ceased to exist. Sefton v. San Diego Trust & Savings
Bank, Cal.App., 106 P.2d 974, 984.
The doctrine of "alter ego" does not create assets for
or in corporation, but it simply fastens liability on the
individual who uses the corporation merely as an instru-
mentality in conducting his own personal business, and
that liability springs from fraud perpetrated not on the
corporation, but on third persons dealing with corporation.
Garvin v. Matthews, 193 Wash. 152, 74 P.2d 990, 992.
A new corporation taking over all of mortgaged assets of
old corporation in exchange for all of old corporation's
capital stock and continuing to operate business formerly
operated by old corporation was "alter ego" of old corpo-
ration so as to be obligated to pay annual patent royalty
which old corporation was required to pay, notwithstand-
ing that old corporation retained title to mortgaged assets.
Dummer v. Wheeler Osgood Sales Corp., 198 Wash. 381, 88
P.2d 453, 458.

## ALTERATION

Variation; changing; making
different. A change of a thing from one form or
state to another; making a thing different from
what it was without destroying its identity. Paye
v. City of Grosse Pointe, 279 Mich. 254, 271. N.W.
826, 827. See Alter.
As applied to buildings, it is a change or substitution in
a substantial particular of one part of a building for a
building different in that particular; a change or changes
within the superficial limits of an existing structure; an
installation that becomes an integral part of the building
and changes its structural quality; a substantial change
therein; a varying or changing the form or nature of such
building without destroying its identity. Paye v. City of
Grosse Pointe, 279 Mich. 254, 271 N.W. 826, 827.
Alteration of highway means change of course of exist-
ing highway, leaving it substantially the same highway as
before, but with its course in some respects changed. Hue-
ning v. Shenkenberg, 208 Wis. 177, 242 N.W. 552, 553.
An alteration is an act done upon the instru-
ment by which its meaning or language is
changed. If what is written upon or erased from
the instrument has no tendency to produce this
result, or to mislead any person, it is not an al-
teration. Oliver v. Hawley, 5 Neb. 444.
An alteration is said to be material when it af-
fects, or may possibly affect, the rights of the
persons interested in the document.
Language different in legal effect, or change in rights,
interests, or obligations of parties. Bank of Moberly v.
Meals, 316 Mo. 1158, 295 S.W. 73, 77; Commercial Credit
Co. v. Giles, Tex.Civ.App., 207 S.W. 596, 598. It introduces
some change into instrument's terms, meaning, language,
or details. See U. S. v. Sacks, 257 U.S. 37, 42 S.Ct. 38, 39,
66 L. Ed. 118. Strictly speaking, it is some material change
on face of instrument by one of the parties thereto with-
out consent of the other, Johnston v. DePuy, 15 N.J.Misc.
94, 188 A. 742, 743; since a mutual agreement of parties
concerned creates a new agreement. Leake, Cont. 430. If
performed by a mere stranger, it is more technically
described as a spoliation or mutilation. Knox v. Horne,
Tex.Civ.App., 200 S.W. 259, 260; Bercot v. Velkoff, 111 Ind.
App. 323, 41 N.E.2d 686, 692. The term is not properly
applied to any change which involves the substitution of a
practically new document. Kempner v. Simon, 195 N.Y.S.
333, 334, 119 Misc.Rep. 60. And it should in strictness be
reserved for the designation of changes in form or lan-
guage, and not used with reference to modifications in
matters of substance. The term is also to be distinguished
from "defacement." Too, if what is done simply takes
away what was given before, or a part of it under a will, it
is a revocation; but if it gives something in addition or in
substitution, then it is an alteration. Appeal of Miles, 68
Conn. 237, 36 A. 39, 36 L.R.A. 176.

## ALTERCATION

Warm contentions in words,
dispute carried on with heat or anger, contro-
versy, wrangle, wordy contest. Ivory v. State,
128 Tex.Cr.R. 408, 81 S.W.2d 696, 698.

## ALTERIUS CIRCUMVENTIO ALU NON PRIE- BET ACTIONEM

The deceiving of one person
does not afford an action to another. Dig. 50, 17,
ALTERNAT. A usage among diplomatists by
which the rank and places of different powers,
who have the same right and pretensions to pre-
cedence, are changed from time to time, either in
a certain regular order or one determined by
lot. In drawing up treaties and conventions, for
example, it is the usage of certain powers to al-
ternate, both in the preamble and the signatures,
so that each power occupies, in the copy intended
to be delivered to it, the first place. Wheat.Int.
Law, § 157.

one of several acts at the election of the party
from whom performance is due. Crane v. Peer,
43 N.J.Eq. 553, 4 A. 72.

## ALTERNATIVE JUDGMENT

See Judgment.

## ALTERNATIVE OBLIGATION

An obligation al-
lowing the obligor to choose which of two things
he will do, the performance of either of which
will satisfy the instrument. A promise to deliv-
er a certain thing or to pay a specified sum of
money is an example of this kind of obligation.

## ALTERNATIVE PLEADING

A pleading alleg-
ing substantive facts so disjunctively that it can-
not be determined upon which of them the plead-
er intends to rely as basis for recovery. Groover
v. Savannah Bank & Trust Co., 186 Ga. 476, 198
S.E. 217, 219.

## ALTERNATIVE RELIEF

The term "alterna-
tive," as used in Equity Rule 25 (see Fed.Rules
Civ.Proc. rule 8, 28 U.S.C.A.), allowing relief to be
stated and sought in alternative forms, means
mutually exclusive. Boyd v. New York & H. R.
Co., D.C.N.Y., 220 F. 174, 179.

## ALTERNATIVE REMAINDERS

Remainders In
which disposition of property is made in alterna-
tive, one to take effect only in case the other does
not, and in substitution of it. Riddle v. Killian,
366 Ill. 294, 8 N.E.2d 629, 634.

## ALTERNATIVE REMEDY

Where a new reme-
dy is created in addition to an existing one, they
are called "alternative" if only one can be en-
forced; but if both, "cumulative."
ALTERNATIVE WRIT. A writ commanding the
person against whom it is issued to do a specified
thing, or show cause to the court why he should
not be compelled to do it. Allee v. McCoy, 2
Marv., Del., 465, 36 A. 359. Under the common-
law practice, the first mandamus is an alternative
writ; 3 Bla.Com. 111; but in modern practice this
writ is often dispensed with and its place is taken
by a rule to show cause. See Mandamus.

## ALTERNIS VICIBUS

L. Lat. By alternate
turns; at alternate times; alternately. Co.Litt.
4a; Shep.Touch. 206.

## ALTERUM NON LIEDERE

Not to injure anoth-
er. This maxim, and two others, honeste vivere,

uncertainty arising from the use of peculiar words, or of
common words in a peculiar sense. Wig. Wills, 174; In
re Milliette's Estate, 206 N.Y.S. 342, 349, 123 Misc.Rep.

vise. Texas Co. v. Fort, 168 Tenn. 679, 80 S.W.2d
658, 660.
In old English law, it was a penalty imposed upon a per-
son by way of disgrace or infamy, as a punishment for any
offense, or for the purpose of making reparation for any
injury done to another, as the walking into church in a
white sheet, with a rope about the neck and a torch in
the hand, and begging the pardon of God, or the king, or
any private individual, for some delinquency.
A punishment somewhat similar to this, which bore the
same name, was common in France for offenses against
public decency or morality. It was abolished by the law
of the 25th of September, 1791; Merlin, Rêpert. In 1826
it was re-introduced in cases of sacrilege and was finally
abolished in 1830.

## AMENDMENT

tion in the law already existing, leaving some part of the
original still standing. State ex inf. Crain ex rel. Peebles

well as corrections of, matters already treated. Christian
Feigenspan, Inc., v. Bodine, D.C.N.J., 264 F. 186, 190. See,
also, State v. Fulton, 99 Ohio St. 168, 124 N.E. 172, 175.
In practice it is the correction of error commit-
ted in progress of a cause. Lintott v. McCluskey,
105 N.J.Eq. 354, 148 A. 161, 164. The correction
of an error committed in any process, pleading, or
proceeding at law, or in equity, and which is done
either of course, or by the consent of parties, or
upon motion to the court in which the proceeding
is pending. 3 Bl.Comm. 407, 448; 1 Tidd, Pr. 696.
Hardin v. Boyd, 113 U.S. 756, 5 Sup.Ct. 771, 28 L.
Ed. 1141.
An amendment to a pleading, as distinguished from a
"supplemental pleading" ( q. v.), has reference to facts
existing at the time of the commencement of the action.

And it is the correction of some error or mistake in a
pleading already before the court. Pantaleo v. Colt's Pat-
ent Fire Arms Mfg. Co., D.C.N.Y., 13 F.Supp. 989, 990.

## AMENDS

A satisfaction given by a wrongdoer
to the party injured, for a wrong committed. 1
Lil.Reg. 81.

## AMENITY

In real property law, such circum-
stances, in regard to situation, outlook, access to a
water course, or the like, as enhance the pleasant-
ness or desirability of an estate for purposes of
residence, or contribute to the pleasure and enjoy-
ment of the occupants, rather than to their in-
dispensable needs.
In England, upon the building of a railway or the con-
struction of other public works, "amenity damages" maY
be given for the defacement of pleasure grounds, the
impairment of riparian rights, or other destruction of or
injury to the amenities of the estate.
In the law of easements, an "amenity" consists in
restraining the owner from doing that with and on his
property which, but for the grant or covenant, he might
lawfully have done; sometimes called a "negative ease-
ment" as distinguished from that class of easements which
compel the owner to suffer something to be done on his
property by another. Equitable Life Assur. Soc. v. Bren-
nan, 30 Abb.N.C. 260, 24 N.Y.Supp. 784, 788. A restrictive
covenant. South Buffalo Stores v. W. T. Grant Co., 274

## AMERCE

To impose an amercement or fine;
to punish by a fine or penalty.

## AMERCEMENT

A pecuniary penalty, in the
nature of a fine, imposed upon a person for some
fault or misconduct, he being "in mercy" for his
offense. It was assessed by the peers of the de-
linquent, or the affeerors, or imposed arbitrarily
at the discretion of the court or the lord. Good-
year v. Sawyer, C.C.Tenn., 17 Fed. 9.
The difference between amercements and fines is as fol-
lows : The latter are certain, and are created by some
statute ; they can only be imposed and assessed by courts
of record; the former are arbitrarily imposed. Termes
de la Ley, 40.
The word "amercement" has long been especially used
of a mulct or penalty, imposed by a court upon its own
officers for neglect of duty, or failure to pay over moneys
collected. In particular, the remedy against a sheriff for
failing to levy an execution or make return of proceeds of
sale is, in several of the states, known as "amercement."
In others, the same result is reached by process of attach-
ment. Abbott. Stansbury v. Mfg. Co., 5 N.J.Law, 441.

## AMERCEMENT ROYAL

In Great Britain a pen-
alty imposed on an officer for a misdemeanor in
his office.

## AMERICAN

Pertaining to the western hemis-
phere or in a more restricted sense to the United
States. See Beardsley v. Selectmen of Bridge-
port, 53 Conn. 493, 3 A. 557, 55 Am.Rep. 152. It
was assumed in Life Photo Film Corp. v. Bell, 90
Misc.Rep. 469, 154 N.Y.S. 763, 764, that the term
"American" included all classes of citizens, native
and naturalized, irrespective of where they origi-
nally came from.

## AMERICAN AGENCY SYSTEM

Its purport is

300 Mich. 54, 1 N.W.2d 450, 453.

## AMERICAN CLAUSE

tors authorized to abate something of the strict-
ness of the law in favor of natural equity.

## AMICABLE SCIRE FACIAS TO REVIVE A JUDGMENT

A written agreement, signed by the
person to be bound by the revival, in the nature
of a writ of scire facias with a confession of judg-
ment thereon, which must be duly docketed, but
which requires no judicial action on the part of

a judgment rendered upon an adverse or contest-
ed writ of scire facias. Second Nat. Bank, for

## AMNESIA

## AMNESTY

A sovereign act of oblivion for past
acts, granted by a government to all persons (or
to certain persons) who have been guilty of crime
or delict, generally political offenses,—treason, se-
dition, rebellion,—and often conditioned upon
their return to obedience and duty within a pre-
scribed time.
A general pardon or proclamation of such par-
don from subjects' offenses against the govern-
ment; while usually exerted in behalf of certain
classes of persons, subject to trial, but not con-
victed, it is not confined to such cases. Common-
wealth v. Hamburg Magistrate, 104 Pa.Super. 221,
158 A. 629, 631.
A declaration of the person or persons who have
newly acquired or recovered the sovereign power
in a state, by which they pardon all persons who
composed, supported, or obeyed the government
which has been overthrowti.
The word "amnesty" properly belongs to international
law, and is applied *to treaties of peace following a state
of war, and signifies there the burial in oblivion of the
particular cause of strife, so that that shall not be again a
cause for war between the parties; and this signification of
"amnesty" is fully and poetically expressed in the Indian
custom of burying the hatchet. And so amnesty is applied
to rebellions which by their magnitude are brought within
the rules of international law. It means only "oblivion,"
and never is a grant. Knote v. U. S., 10 Ct.C1. 407.
Amnesty is the abolition and forgetfulness of the offense;
pardon is forgiveness. Knote v. U. S., 95 U.S. 149, 152, 24
L.Ed. 442. The first is usually addressed to crimes against
the sovereignty of the state, to political offenses; the sec-
ond condones infractions of the peace of the state. Bur-
dick v. United States, 236 U.S. 79, 35 S.Ct. 267, 271, 59
L.Ed. 476.
Express amnesty is one granted in direct terms.

treaty of peace is made between contending par-
ries. Vattel, 1, 4, c. 2, § 20.

378, 130 P. 525, 529. Where property is directed by will
to be distributed among several persons, it cannot be all
given to one, nor can any of the persons be wholly
excluded from the distribution. Hudson v. Hudson, 6
Munf., Va., 352.
"Among" is sometimes held to be equivalent to
"between" ; Hick's Estate, 134 Pa. 507, 19 A. 705; Records
v. Fields, 155 Mo. 314, 55 S.W. 1021. But "among" implies
more than two objects as differentiated with "between."

47, 53.

thereby not only dedicating the street to public

pensation. Dwornick v. State, 251 App.Div. 675,

It expresses a general relation or connection, a participa-
tion or accompaniment in sequence, having no inherent
meaning standing alone but deriving force from what
comes before and after. In its conjunctive sense the word
is used to conjoin words, clauses, or sentences, expressing
the relation of addition or connection, and signifying that
something is to follow in addition to that which proceeds
and its use implies that the connected elements must be
grammatically co-ordinate, as where the elements preced-
ing and succeeding the use of the words refer to the same
synonym of the word in English, it has been defined to
mean "along with", "also", "and also", "as well as", "be-
sides", "together with". Oliver v. Oliver, 286 Ky. 6, 149
S.W.2d 540, 542.

## ANNEX

Derived from the Latin "annectere,"
meaning to tie or bind to. To attach, and often,
specifically, to subjoin. In re Annexation to City
of Easton of Tract of Land in Williams Tp.,
Northampton County, 139 Pa.Super. 146, 11 A.2d
662, 664. To add to; to unite. The word ex-
presses the idea of joining a smaller or subordi-
nate thing with another, larger, or of higher im-
portance. Waterbury Lumber & Coal Co. v. Aster-
chinsky, 87 Conn. 316, 87 A. 739, 740, Ann.Cas.
1916B, 613. To consolidate, as school districts.
Evans v. Hurlburt, 117 Or. 274, 243 P. 553, 554. To
make an integral part of something larger.
It implies physical connection or physically joined to,
yet physical connection may be dispensed with, and things
may be annexed without being in actual contact, when
reasonably practicable. Elliott Common School Dist. No.
48 v. County Board of School Trustees, Tex.Civ.App., 76
S.W.2d 786, 789.
In the law relating to fixtures, the expression "annexed
to the freehold" means fastened to or connected with it;
mere juxtaposition, or the laying of an object, however
heavy, on the freehold, does not amount to annexation.
Merritt v. Judd, 14 Cal. 64.

## ANNEXATION

The act of attaching, adding,
joining, or uniting one thing to another; general-
ly spoken of the connection of a smaller or sub-
ordinate thing with a larger or principal thing.
The attaching an illustrative or auxiliary document to
a deposition, pleading, deed, etc., is called "annexing" it.
So the incorporation of newly-acquired territory into the
national domain, as an integral part thereof, is called "an-
nexation," as in the case of the addition of Texas to the
United States.
In the law relating to fixtures: Actual annexation in-
cludes every movement by which a chattel can be joined
or united to the freehold. Constructive annexation is the

realty, but which are not actually annexed, fixed, or
fastened to the freehold. Shep.Touch. 469; Amos & F.
Fixt. 2.
Scotch Law

## ANSWER

As a verb, the word denotes an as-

Pleading
Strictly speaking, it is a pleading by which de-
fendant in suit at law endeavors to resist the
plaintiff's demand by an allegation of facts, either
denying allegations of plaintiff's complaint or
ance, which defendant alleges should prevent re-
covery on facts alleged by plaintiff. In re Herle's
Will, 173 Misc. 879, 19 N.Y.S.2d 263, 265.
In chancery pleading, the term denotes a de-
fense in writing, made by a defendant to the alle-
gations contained in a bill or information filed by
the plaintiff against him.
In pleading, under the Codes of Civil Procedure, the an-
swer is the formal written statement made by a defendant
setting forth the grounds of his defense; corresponding to
what, in actions under the common-law practice is called
the "plea." But as used in a statute providing that de-
fendant must appear and answer the petition, "answer"
refers to any sort of pleading filed by defendant. State ex
rel. Oliver Hast Auction Co. v. Grimm, 197 Mo.App. 566,
196 S.W. 1019, 1021. Cross-complaint. Celina Mut. Casu-
alty Co. v. Baldridge, 213 Ind. 193, 12 N.E.2d 258, 260.

contra. Mariner v. Milisich, 45 Nev. 193, 200 P. 478.
In Massachusetts, the term denotes the statement of the
matter intended to be relied upon by the defendant in
avoidance of the plaintiff's action, taking the place of spe-
cial pleas in bar, and the general issue, except in real and
mixed actions. Pub.St.Mass.1882, p. 1287.
In matrimonial suits in the (English) probate, divorce,
and admiralty division, an answer is the pleading by which

Under the old admiralty practice in England, the defend-
ant's first pleading was called his "answer." Williams &
B. Adm. Jur. 246.
Frivolous answer. See Sham Answer, infra.
An irrelevant answer is one that has no substantial rela-
tion to the controversy;—distinguishable from a sham an-
swer. Rosatti v. Common School Dist. No. 96 of Cass
County, 53 N.D. 268, 205 N.W. 678, 679.
A sham answer is one sufficient on its face but so clearly
false that it presents no real issue to be tried. Bank of
Richards, Mo., v. Sheasgreen, 153 Minn. 363, 190 N.W. 484.
One good in form, but false in fact and not pleaded in
good faith. Burkhalter v. Townsend, 139 S.C. 324, 138 S.E.
34, 36. A frivolous answer, on the other hand, is one
which on its face sets up no defense, although it may be
true in fact.
A voluntary answer, in chancery, was an answer put in
by a defendant, when plaintiff had filed no interrogatories
which required to be answered. Hunt, Eq.
Practice
A reply to interrogatories; an affidavit in an-
swer to interrogatories. The declaration of a fact
by a witness after a question has been put, ask-
ing for it.

## ANTHROPOMETRY

In criminal law and medi-

of the human body, both absolutely and in their
proportion to each other, the facial, cranial, and
other angles, the shape and size of the skull, etc.,
for purposes of comparison with corresponding
measurements of other individuals, and serving
for the identification of the subject in cases of
doubtful or disputed identity. It was largely
adopted after its introduction in France in 1883,
but fell into disfavor as being costly and as liable
to error. It has given place to the "finger print"
system devised by Francis Galton. See Bertillon
System.

## ANTICHRESIS

In the civil law. A species of
mortgage, or pledge of immovables. An agree-
ment by which the debtor gives to the creditor the
income from the property which he has pledged,
in lieu of the interest on his debt. Guyot, Repert;
Marquise De Portes v. Hurlbut. 44 N.J.Eq. 517, 14
A. 891. It is analogous to the Welsh mortgage of
the common law. In the French law, if the in-
come was more than the interest, the debtor was
entitled to demand an account of the income, and
might claim any excess.
A debtor may give as security for his debt any
immovable which belongs to him, the creditor hav-
ing the right to enjoy the use of it on account of
the interest due, or of the capital if there is no
interest due; this is called "antichresis." Civ.
Code Mex. art. 1927.
By the law of Louisiana, there are two kinds of
pledges,—the pawn and the antichresis. A pawn
relates to movables, and the antichresis to im-
movables. The antichresis must be reduced to
writing; and the creditor thereby acquires the
right to the fruits, etc., of the immovables, de-
ducting yearly their proceeds from the interest,
in the first place, and afterwards from the prin-
cipal of his debt. He is bound to pay taxes on the
property, and keep it in repair, unless the con-
trary is agreed. The creditor does not become the
proprietor of the property by failure to pay at the
agreed time, and any clause to that effect is void.
He can only sue the debtor, and obtain sentence
for sale of the property. The possession of the
property is, however, by the contract, transferred
to the creditor. La.Civil Code, Arts. 3176-3181;
Livingston v. Story, 11 Pet. 351, 9 L.Ed. 746.
The "antichresis" is an antiquated contract, and
has been resorted to in Louisiana in but a few
instances. Harang v. Ragan, 134 La. 201, 63 So.
875, 877. Essential element of contract, Conklin
v. Caffall, 179 So. 434, 437, 438, 439, 189 La. 301.

## ANTICIPATION

S. 156, 36 L.Ed. 658.
is not "anticipation". Swan Carburetor Co. v. Nash
Motors Co., D.C.Md., 25 F.Supp. 24, 34. The test being
whether patentee has added anything of value to the sum
of human knowledge, whether he has made the world's
work easier, cheaper, and safer, so that return to prior
art would be a retrogression. Butler v. Burch Plow Co.,
C.C.A.Cal., 23 F.2d 15, 24. But invention is not "antici-
pated" by accidental, incidental or unintentional use of
some of its features, unless the benefits or ensuing results
from such use are appreciated or recognized. Balaban v.
Polyfoto Corporation, D.C.Del., 47 F.Supp. 472, 477, 478.
In law of negligence, "anticipation" is not con-
fined to expectation. Kenney v. Wong Len, 81
N.H. 427, 128 A. 343, 344. But compare Hardy v.
Missouri Pac. R. Co., C.C.A.Ark., 266 F. 860, 863, 36
A.L.R. 1. It means probability not possibility as
applied to duty to anticipate consequences of

as meaning within a reasonable time. Paulson
v. Weeks, 80 Or. 468, 157 P. 590, 592, Ann.Cas.
1918D, 741. And the words "any other" following

Sometimes called a flat or flat house. Lignot v.
Jaekle, 72 N.J.Eq. 233, 65 A. 221. It comes within
the prohibition of a restrictive building covenant
forbidding buildings designed for any purpose
other than a private dwelling house. Taylor v.
Lambert, 279 Pa. 514, 124 A. 169, 170. But it is not
a "hotel." Satterthwait v. Gibbs, 288 Pa. 428, 135
A. 862, 864. A house for two families has been
held to be an "apartment house" within a restric-
tive covenant. Austin v. Richardson, Tex.Com.
App., 288 S.W. 180, 181.

L.Ed. 330. An "apex" is all that portion of a
terminal edge of a mineral vein from which the
vein has extension downward in the direction of
the dip. Stewart Mining Co. v. Ontario Mining Co.,
35 S.Ct. 610, 614, 237 U.S. 350, 59 L.Ed. 989. Or
it is the juncture of two dipping limbs of a fissure

technicality; a rule of law carried to an extreme
point, either of severity or refinement A term
used to denote a stricter application of the rules
of law than is indicated by the phrase summum
jus (q. v.).

## APEX RULE

In mining law. The mineral laws
of the United States give to the locator of a min-
ing claim on the public domain the whole of every
vein the apex of which lies within his surface
exterior boundaries, or within perpendicular
planes drawn downward indefinitely on the planes
of those boundaries; and he may follow a vein
which thus apexes within his boundaries, on its
dip, although it may so far depart from the per-
pendicular in its course downward as to extend
outside the vertical side-lines of his location,. but
he may not go beyond his end-lines or vertical
planes drawn downward therefrom. This is called
the apex rule. Rev.St.U.S. § 2322 (30 U.S.C.A. §
26) ; Stewart Mining Co v. Ontario Mining Co.,
23 Idaho, 724, 132 P. 787, 792.

## APHASIA

In medical jurisprudence. Loss of the
faculty or power of articulate speech; a condition
in which the patient, while retaining intelligence
and understanding and with the organs of speech
unimpaired, is unable (in "motor aphasia") to
utter articulate words, or unable to vocalize the
particular word which is in his mind and which
he wishes to use, or utters words different from
those he believes himself to be speaking, or (in
"sensory aphasia" or apraxia) is unable to under-
stand spoken or written language. Sensory
aphasia includes word blindness and word deaf-
ness, visual and auditory aphasia. Motor aphasia
often includes agraphia, or the inability to write
words of the desired meaning. The seat of the
disease is in the brain, but it is not a form of
insanity.

## APHONIA

In medical jurisprudence. Loss of the
power of articulate speech in consequence of mor-
bid conditions of some of the vocal organs. It
may be incomplete, in which case the patient can
whisper. It is to be distinguished from congenital
dumbness, and from temporary loss of voice
through extreme hoarseness or minor affections
of the vocal cords, as also from aphasia, the lat-
ter being a disease of the brain without impair-
ment of the organs of speech.
APICES JURIS NON SUNT JURA [JUS]. Ex-
tremities, or mere subtleties of law are not rules
of law [are not law]. Co.Litt. 304b; 10 Coke,
126; Wing.Max. 19, max. 14; Broom, Max. 188.
Legal principles must not be carried to their ex-
treme consequences, regardless of equity and good
sense. Salmond, Jurispr. 639. See Apex Juris.

## APICES LITIGANDI

Extremely fine points, or
subtleties of litigation. Nearly equivalent to the
scionable in a defendant to take advantage of the
apices litigandi, to turn a plaintiff around and
make him pay costs when his demand is just."
Per Lord Mansfield, in 3 Burr. 1243.

## APNEA

In medical jurisprudence. Want of
breath; difficulty in breathing; partial or tempo-
rary suspension of respiration; specifically, such
difficulty of respiration resulting from over-oxy-
genation of the blood, and in this distinguished
from "asphyxia" (q. v.), which is a condition re-
sulting from a deficiency of oxygen in the blood
due to suffocation or any serious interference with
normal respiration. The two terms were formerly
(but improperly) used synonymously.
APOCHA (also Apoca). Lat. In the civil law.
A writing acknowledging payments; acquittance.
It differs from acceptilation in this: that ac-
ceptilation imports a complete discharge of the
former obligation whether payment be made or
not; apocha, discharge only upon payment being
made. Calvin. See Antapocha.

earth, its tide-producing power is diminished and
tides at such time exhibit a decreased rise and

APOGRAPHIA. In civil law. An examination
and enumeration of things possessed; an inven-
tory. Calvinus, Lex.

## APOPLEXY

In medical jurisprudence. The fail-
ure of consciousness and suspension of voluntary
motion from suspension of the functions of the
cerebrum.
The group of symptoms arising from rupture
of a minute artery and consequent hemorrhage in-
to the substance of the brain or from the lodg-
arteries.
The symptoms consist usually of sudden loss of con-
sciousness, muscular relaxation, lividity of the face and
slow stertorous respiration, lasting from a few hours to
several days. Death frequently ensues. If consciousness
returns, there is found paralysis of some of the voluntary
muscles, very frequently of the muscles of the face, arm,
and leg upon one side, giving the symptom of hemiplegia.
There is usually more or less mental impairment, which
presents no uniform character, but varies indefinitely.
By apoplexy is meant a break or rupture of a blood
vessel in the brain, not produced by any external cause.
Robinson v. ./Etna Life Ins. Co., Tex.Com.App., 276 S.W.
900, 902.

## APOTHECARY

Any person who keeps a shop

Walk. (Pa.) 550.
In England and Ireland an apothecary is a mem-
ber of an inferior branch of the medical profes-
sion and is licensed by the Apothecaries Company
to practice medicine as well as to sell drugs.
The term "druggist" properly means one whose occupa-
tion is to buy and sell drugs without compounding or pre-
paring them. The term therefore has a much more limited
and restricted meaning than the word "apothecary," and
there is little difficulty in concluding that the term "drug-
gist" may be applied in a technical sense to persons who
buy and sell drugs. State v. Donaldson, 41 Minn. 74, 42 N.
W. 781.

## APP

CT. Appellate Court.

## APPARATOR

A furnisher or provider. For-
merly the sheriff, in England, had charge of cer-
tain county affairs and disbursements, in which
capacity he was called "apparator comitatus"
(apparator for the county), and received therefor
a considerable emolument. Cowell.

## APPARATUS

An outfit of tools, utensils, or in-
struments adapted to accomplishment of any
branch of work or for performance of experiment
or operation. McClintock & Irvine Co. v. 'Etna
Explosives Co., 260 Pa. 191, 103 A. 622, 623, Ann.
Cas.1918E, 1078. A group or set of organs con-
cerned in performance of single function. First
State Bank of Perkins v. Pulliam, 112 Okl. 22, 239

hensive significance which may mean implements
and an equipment of things provided, and adapt-
ed as a means to some end. Bruce v. Sibeck, 25
Cal.App.2d 691, 78 P.2d 741, 743.
As used in statutes granting exemption from
execution, etc., "apparatus" means a complex de-
vice or machine designed for the accomplishment
of a special purpose; a complex instrument or ap-
pliance, mechanical or chemical, for a specific ac-
tion or operation; machinery; mechanism; as a
newspaper printing press, Harris v. Townley, Tex.
Civ.App., 161 S.W. 5; or four pool tables, Harris
v. Todd, Tex.Civ.App., 158 S.W 1189; but not a
threshing outfit, Corner v. Powell, Tex.Civ.App.,
189 S.W. 88, 91; nor a well-drilling rig, consist-
ing of boiler, engine, and other parts of compli-
cated machinery, Thresher v. McEvoy, Tex.Civ.
App., 193 S.W. 159, 160. In re Willis, D.C.Tex., 292
F. 872, 873, it was said that the term "apparatus"
is practically synonymous with "tools."
APPAREL. The term is said to derive from two
sources, "apparel" from the Latin "ad," meaning
to, and "par," meaning equal, to point out the
means by which outwardly one keeps even or in
line with his group or class. In re Steimes' Es-
tate, 270 N.Y.S. 339, 150 Misc. 279 (a will case).

## APPARENT

That which is obvious, evident, or
manifest; what appears, or has been made mani-

John Smith, T., 199 Ala. 514, 74 So. 451, 453; In
respect to facts involved in an appeal or writ of
error, that which is stated in the record. An er-
ror discovered by close scrutiny of the entire evi-
dence is not "apparent." Stewart v. McAllister,
Tex.Civ.App., 209 S.W. 704, 706.
"Apparent" means "open to view," "capable of
being easily understood," "evident," "seeming,"
rather than "true" or "real," "synonymous with,"
"likely," "probable," or "obvious" and as meaning
primarily, "capable of being seen or easily seen,"
"open to view," "visible to the eye," "within sight

A.2d 914, 915 (in statute requiring driver to stop
after automobile accident).
The word "apparent" within rule that use of realty must
be apparent to create easement by implication on severance
of unity of ownership of dominant and servient tenements
does not necessarily mean "visible", but means that ease-
ment's indicia, careful inspection of which by person ordi-
narily conversant with subject would disclose such use,
must be plainly visible. Romanchuk v. Plotkin, 215 Minn.
156, 9 N.W.2d 421, 425.
APPARENT AGENCY, See Agency.

## APPARENT AUTHORITY

In the law of agency,
such authority as the principal knowingly permits
the agent to assume, or which he holds the agent
out as possessing; such authority as he appears
to have by reason of the actual authority which
he has; such authority as a reasonably prudent
man, using diligence and discretion, in view of the
principal's conduct, would naturally suppose the
agent to possess. Iowa Loan & Trust Co. v. Sea-
man, 203 Iowa 310, 210 N.W. 937, 940; Kissell v.
Pittsburgh, Ft. W. & C. Ry. Co., 194 Mo.App. 346,
188 S.W. 1118, 1121; Brager v. Levy, 122 Md. 554,
90 A. 102, 104; Atto v. Saunders, 77 N.H. 527, 93
A. 1037, 1039; Campbell Paint & Varnish Co. v.
Ladd Furniture & Carpet Co., Tex.Civ.App., 83
S.W.2d 1095, 1097; Humble Oil & Refining Co. v.
Wood, Tex.Civ.App., 94 S.W.2d 573, 574.
It includes the power to do whatever is usually
done and necessary to be done in order to carry
into effect the principal power conferred. Oliver
v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., 176 N.C.
598, 97 S.E. 490, 491. Such authority as a princi-
pal intentionally or by want of ordinary care
causes or allows third person to believe that agent
possesses. Fireman's Fund Indemnity Co. v.
Longshore Beach and Country Club, Inc., 127
Conn. 493, 18 A.2d 347, 349.
It is not actual authority and may often be authority not
actually possessed by agent, but is such as principal holds
agent out as possessing. Northwestern Mut. Life Ins. Co.
v. Steckel, 216 Iowa 1189, 250 N.W. 476; Herbert v. Lang-
hoff, La.App., 164 So. 262, 266.
"Apparent authority" of an agent must be determined
by what the principal does, rather than by acts of the
agent. Grismore v. Consolidated Products Co., 232 Iowa
328, 5 N.W.2d 646, 651.
It must be traceable to the principal and cannot be es-
tablished solely by acts and conduct of agent, and princi-
pal is only liable for the appearance of authority caused by
him. Storms v. United Grain & Millworkers' Union, 64
Ohio App. 19, 27 N.E.2d 781, 783.

## APPARENT DANGER

As used with reference
to the doctrine of self-defense in homicide, means
such overt actual demonstration, by conduct and
acts, of a design to take life or do some great
personal injury, as would make the killing ap-
parently necessary to self-preservation. Modesett
v. Emmons, Tex.Com.App., 292 S.W. 855, 856.
Under a statute providing that it shall not be a defense
to an action for injuries to an employee that the dangers
inherent or apparent in the employment contributed to
the injury, an "apparent danger" is one the existence of
which the employee has knowl'Aige, actual or constructive.
Standard Steel Car Co. v. Martinecz, 66 Ind.App. 672, 113
N.E. 244, 248.

## APPARENT DEFECTS

In a thing sold, are
those which can be discovered by simple inspec-
tion. Code La. art. 2497 (Civil Code, § 2521).
See, also, Woolley v. Ablah, 119 Kan. 380, 240 P.
266, 269.

## APPARENT EASEMENT

See Easement.

## APPARENT HEIR

In English law. One whose
right of inheritance is indefeasible, provided he
outlive the ancestor. 2 Bl.Comm. 208. See, also,
Heir Apparent. In Scotch law. He is the person
to whom the succession has actually opened. He
is so called until his regular entry on the lands
by service or infeftment on a precept of Clare
constat.

## APPARENT NECESSITY

In actions under the
Alabama Homicide Act, "apparent necessity"
which will justify killing in self-defense must be
such as to impress a reasonable man of its pres-
ence and imminence, and must so impress de-
fendant at the time of the fatal shot. Drummond
v. Drummond, 212 Ala. 242, 102 So. 112, 114.

## APPARITIO

In old practice. Appearance; an
appearance. Apparitio in judicio, an appearance
in court. Bract. fol. 344. Post apparitionem, after
appearance. Fleta, lib. 6, c. 10, § 25.

## APPARITOR

An officer or messenger employed
to serve the process of the spiritual courts in
England and summon offenders. Cowell.
In the civil law. An officer who waited upon a magis-
trate or -superior officer, and executed his commands. Cal-
vin.; Cod. 12, 53-57.

## APPARLEMENT

In old English law. Resem-
blance; likelihood; as apparlement of war. St.
2 Rich. II. st. 1, c. 6; Cowell.

## APPARURA

In old English law the apparura
were furniture, implements, tackle, or apparel.
Carucarum apparura, plow-tackle. Cowell.

## APPEAL

In civil practice. The complaint to a
superior court of an injustice done or error com-
mitted by an inferior one, whose judgment or de-
cision the court above is called upon to correct or
reverse.
The removal of a cause from a court of inferior
to one of superior jurisdiction, for the purpose of
obtaining a review and retrial. Hall v. Kincaid,
64 Ind.App. 103, 115 N.E. 361, 365. Lea County
State Bank v. McCaskey Register Co., 39 N.M.
454, 49 P.2d 577, 579.
In general terms a resort to an upper court or
tribunal. State ex rel. School Dist. No. 8 v. Lens-
man, 108 Mont. 118, 88 P.2d 63, 65. A rehearing
by a superior court on both law and fact, a proc-
ess of civil law origin, and the usual and appro-
priate mode of review for cases originating in a
court of equity. Sohland v. Baker, 15 Del.Ch. 431,
141 A. 277, 283, 58 A.L.R. 693.
The word "appeal" has no absolutely fixed and definite
meaning but may be used to denote the review by a court
of the action of some board or administrative officer. In re
Determination of Relative Rights to Use of Waters of Des-
chutes River, 108 P.2d 276, 281, 282, 165 Or. 435. An "ap-
peal" is a creature of statute, not a constitutional or inher-
ent right. Carilli v. Hersey, 303 Mass. 82, 20 N.E.2d 492,
495. It is merely a continuation of original lawsuit. Bow-
ersock v. Missouri Valley Drainage Dist. of Holt County,
237 Mo.App. 346, 168 S.W.2d 479, 481. Patterson v. Old
Dominion Trust Co., 149 Va. 597, 140 S.E. 810, 813. It has
become a term of general application in law, with meaning
depending on statutory provisions respecting appellate pro-
oedure. Cino v. Driscoll, 130 N.J.L. 535, 34 A.2d 6, 8.
Appeal is sometimes used to denote the nature of appel-
late jurisdiction, as distinguished from original jurisdic-
tion, without any particular regard to the mode by which
a cause is transmitted to a superior jurisdiction. Dorris
Motor Car Co. v. Colburn, 307 Mo. 137, 270 S.W. 339, 346.
"Appeal" has no conclusive meaning, and it is necessary
in each instance to look to the particular act giving an
appeal, to determine powers to be exercised by the appel-
late court. McCauley v. Imperial Woolen Co., 261 Pa. 312,
104 A. 617, 620.
The fundamental difference between an "appeal" and an
action to "review" is that in the case of appeal the tri-
bunal by which the first determination was made is not a
party to the proceeding to review, while, in an action to
review, the tribunal which made the determination is a
party to the proceeding to review. Milwaukee County v.
Industrial Commission, 228 Wis. 94, 279 N.W. 655, 657, 658.
An "appeal" in equity is a trial de novo. Simmons v..
Stern, C.C.A.N.M., 9 F.2d 256, 259.
"Appeal" may also be used to denote the act of invoking
another judicial forum for the trial. Newell v. Kalamazoo
Circuit Judge, 215 Mich. 153, 183 N.W. 907, 908. See Ap-
pealed. As used in statutes authorizing taxpayers or par-
ties to condemnation proceedings to appeal, the term often
has its nontechnical sense meaning to "apply for" or
"ask." Purcell Bank & Trust Co. of Purcell v. Byars, 66
Okl. 70, 167 P. 216, 218.
An "appeal" is a step in a judicial proceeding, and in
legal contemplation there can be no appeal where there has
been no decision by a judicial tribunal. Two things are
essential to an appeal in its proper sense : First, the de-
cision of a judicial tribunal, and, second, a superior court
invested with authority to review the decision of the in-
ferior tribunal. People ex rel. Nelson Bros. Storage &
Furniture Co. v. Fisher, 273 Ill. 228, 25 N.E.2d 785, 787.
"Appeal" differs from trial in that it is a review on orig-
inal record after that has been made in accordance with
well-recognized principles of judicial procedure. Koukly
v. Weber, 277 N.Y.S. 39, 154 Misc. 659.
In criminal practice. A formal accusation
made by one private person against another of
having committed some heinous crime. 4 Bl.
Comm. 312.
Appeal was also the name given to the proceed-
ing in English law where a person, indicted of
treason or felony, and arraigned for the same,
confessed the fact before plea pleaded, and ap-
pealed, or accused others, his accomplices in the
same crime, in order to obtain his pardon. In
this case he was called an "approver" or "prover,"
and the party appealed or accused, the "appellee."
4 BI.Comm. 330. Appeals have been abolished by
statute.
Cross Appeal
Where both parties to a judgment appeal there-
from, the appeal of each is called a "cross-appeal"
as regards that of the other. 3 Steph.Comm. 581.
Legislation
The act by which a member of a legislative
body who questions the correctness of a decision
vote of the body upon the decision.
Old French Law
A mode of proceeding in the lords' courts, where
a party was dissatisfied with the judgment of the
peers, which was by accusing them of having giv-
en a false or malicious judgment, and offering to
make good the charge by the duel or combat.
This was called the "appeal of false judgment."
Montesq. Esprit des Lois, liv. 28, c. 27.
Writ of Error Distinguished
The distinction between an appeal and a writ
of error is that an appeal is a process of civil law
origin, and removes a cause entirely, subjecting
the facts, as well as the law, to a review and re-
visal; but a writ of error is of common law ori-
gin, and it removes nothing for re-examination
but the law. Cunningham v. Neagle, 10 S.Ct. 658,
135 U.S. 1, 34 L.Ed. 55; Buessel v. U. S., C.C.A.
Conn., 258 F. 811, 814. The present tendency is
to ignore the distinction between "writ of error"
and "appeal," and, when found in modern stat-
utes, the meaning given "appeal" must be gath-
ered from the language of the statute itself.
Widgins v. Norfolk & W. Ry. Co., 142 Va. 419, 128
S.E. 516, 518.

## APPEAL BOND

The bond given on taking an
appeal, by which the appellant and his sureties
are bound to pay damages and costs if he fails to
prosecute the appeal with effect. Omaha Hotel
Co. v. Kountze, 2 S.Ct. 911, 107 U.S. 378, 27 L.Ed.
609. A general purpose of appeal bonds is to
discourage vexatious and frivolous appeals. State
v. Coletti, 102 Kan. 523, 170 P. 995, 997. To pro-
tect those interested in the judgment. Richmond
v. Williamson, 16 Wash.2d 194, 132 P.2d 1031, 1033.
The sole and only purpose of "appeal bond" is to stay
issuance of execution until cause can be passed upon and
disposed of by appellate court. State ex rel. Gnekow v. U.
S. Fidelity & Guaranty Co., Mo.App., 150 S.W.2d 581, 584.

## APPEAL IN FORMA PAUPERIS

A privilege
given indigent person to prosecute an appeal, oth-
erwise and independently allowable, without pay-
ment of fees and costs incident to such prosecu-
tion. Millslagle v. Olson, C.C.A.Neb., 130 F.2d
212, 213. See, also, In Forma Pauperis.

## APPEALED

In a sense not strictly technical,
this word may be used to signify the exercise by
a party of the right to remove a litigation from
one forum to another; as where he removes a
suit involving the title to real estate from a jus-
tice's court to the common pleas. Lawrence v.
Souther, 8 Metc. (Mass.) 166.

## APPEAR

In practice. To be properly before a
court; as a fact or matter of which it can take
notice. To be in evidence; to be proved. "Mak-
ing it appear and proving are the same thing."
Freem. 53. Coming into court by a party to a
suit, whether plaintiff or defendant. Madison v.
State, 31 Ala.App. 602, 20 So.2d 541, 542; Ben-
nett v. Rodgers, 205 Mo.App. 458, 225 S.W. 101.
See Appearance.
meaning "clear to the comprehension" when ap-
plied to matters of opinion or reasoning, and
"satisfactorily or legally known or made known",
when used in reference to facts of evidence.
Blackshear v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 26 S.E.2d 793,
804, 69 Ga.App. 790. Facts "appear" when the
evidence from which facts may be found is in-
troduced, and presumptions disappear when facts
appear. Christiansen v. Hilber, 282 Mich. 403, 276
N.W. 495, 497.

## APPEAR OF RECORD

A substitution of trustee
under deed of trust "appears of record" in the
office of the chancery clerk, by being actually
spread at large on the record. King v. Jones, 121
Miss. 319, 83 So. 531.

## APPEARANCE

In practice. A coming into
court as party to a suit, whether as plaintiff or
defendant. Stephens v. Ringling, 102 S.C. 333,
86 S.E. 683, 685. The formal proceeding by which a
defendant submits himself to the jurisdiction of
the court. Flint v. Comly, 95 Me. 251, 49 A. 1044.
The voluntary submission to a court's jurisdiction.
Pacilio v. Scarpati, 300 N.Y.S. 473, 478, 165 Misc.
586; Braman v. Braman, 258 N.Y.S. 181, 186, 236
App.Div. 164.
"Appearance" is the act of appearing, coming,
or being in sight, becoming visible or clear to ap-
prehension of the mind, of being known as sub-
ject of observation or comprehension, or as a
thing proved, of being obvious or manifest. Hal-
lack & Howard Lumber Co. v. Bagly, 100 Colo.
402, 68 P.2d 442, 443.
Appearance anciently meant an actual coming into court,
either in person or by attorney. Appearance may be made
by the party in person or by his agent. Everett Ry., Light
& Power Co. v. U. S., D.C.Wash., 236 F. 806, 808. But in
criminal cases the personal appearance of the accused in
court is often necessary.
An appearance may be either general or special; the
former is a simple and unqualified or unrestricted submis-
sion to the jurisdiction of the court, the latter a submis-
sion to the jurisdiction for some specific purpose only, not
for all the purposes of the suit. Louisville & N. R. Co. v.
Industrial Board of Illinois, 282 Ill. 136, 118 N.E. 483, 485.
A special appearance is for the purpose of testing the
sufficiency of service or the jurisdiction of the court; a
general appearance is made where the defendant waives
defects of service and submits to the jurisdiction. State
v. Huller, 23 N.M. 306, 168 P. 528, 534, 1 A.L.R. 170.
An appearance may also be either compulsory or volunta-
ry, the former where it is compelled by process served on
the party, the latter where it is entered by his own will or
consent, without the service of process, though process
may be outstanding. 1 Barb.Ch.Pr. 77. It is said to be
optional when entered by a person who intervenes in the
action to protect his own interests, though not joined as a
party; it occurs in chancery practice, especially in Eng-
land; conditional, when coupled with conditions as to its
becoming or being taken as a general appearance; gratis,
when made by a party to the action, but before the service
of any process or legal notice to appear ; de bene esse,
when made provisionally or to remain good only upon a
future contingency ; or when designed to permit a party to
a proceeding to refuse to submit his person to the jurisdic-
tion of the court unless it is finally determined that he
has forever waived that right. Farmers Trust Co. v.
Alexander, 334 Pa. 434, 6 A.2d 262, 265; subsequent, when
made by a defendant after an appearance has already been
entered for him by the plaintiff ; corporal, when the per-
son is physically present in court.
An answer constitutes an "appearance." Wieser v.
Richter, 247 Mich. 52, 225 N.W. 542, 543. A party who an-
appeal, or does any other substantial act in a cause, al-
though he has not been served with summons, is deemed
to have entered his "appearance" unless he objects and
preserves his protests to the jurisdiction of his person.
Robinson v. Bossinger, 195 Ark. 445, 112 S.W.2d 637, 640.
Acts of an attorney in prosecuting an action on behalf of
his client constitute an "appearance." Pacilio v. Scarpati,
300 N.Y.S. 473, 165 Misc. 586.
Appearance by Attorney
This term and "appearance by counsel" are dis-
tinctly different, the former being the substitution
of a legal agent for the personal attendance of
the suitor, the latter the attendance of an advo-
cate without whose aid neither the party attend-
ing nor his attorney in his stead could safely pro-
ceed; and an appearance by attorney does not su-
persede the appearance by counsel. Mercer v.
Watson, 1 Watts (Pa.) 351. See In re Ford's
Estate, 163 N.Y.S. 960, 98 Misc. 100.
Appearance Day
The day for appearing; that on which the par-
ties are bound to come into court. Cruger v. Mc-
Cracken (Tex.Civ.App.) 26 S.W. 282. Compare
City of Decatur v. Barteau, 260 Ill. 612, 103 N.E.
601, 602.
Appearance Docket
A docket kept by the clerk of the court, in
which appearances are entered, containing also a
brief abstract of all the proceedings in the cause.
See McAdams v. Windham, 191 Ala. 287, 68 So. 51,
Notice of Appearance
A notice given by defendant to a plaintiff that
he appears in the action in person or by attorney.

## APPEARAND HEIR

In Scotch law. An appar-
ent heir. See Heir Apparent.

## APPELLANT

The party who takes an appeal
from one court or jurisdiction to another. Used
broadly or nontechnically, the term includes one
who sues out a writ of error. Widgins v. Norfolk
& W. Ry. Co., 142 Va. 419, 128 S.E. 516, 518.

## APPELLATE

Pertaining to or having cogni-
zance of appeals and other proceedings for the
judicial review of adjudications.
Word "appellate" has a general meaning, and it has
a specific meaning indicating the distinction between orig-
inal jurisdiction and appellate jurisdiction. Woodruff v.
Bell, 143 Kan. 110, 53 P.2d 498, 499.

## APPELLATE COURT

A court having jurisdic-
tion of appeal and review; a court to which caus-
es are removable by appeal, certiorari, or error;
a reviewing court, and, except in special cases
where original jurisdiction is conferred, not a
"trial court" or court of first instance. Sanborn
v. Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co., 42 Cal.App.2d 99, 108
P.2d 458, 461; Jackson v. Chesapeake & 0. Ry.
Co., 179 Va. 642, 20 S.E.2d 489, 493.

## APPELLATE JURISDICTION

The power and
authority to take cognizance of a cause and pro-
ceed to its determination, not in its initial stages,
inferior court, i. e., the power of review and de-
termination on appeal, writ of error, certiorari,
or other similar process. Jurisdiction on appeal;
jurisdiction to revise or correct the proceedings in
a cause already instituted and acted upon by an
inferior court, or by a tribunal having the attri-
butes of a court. Illinois Cent. R. Co. v. Dodd,
105 Miss. 23, 61 So. 743, 49 L.R.A.,N.S., 565. The
term includes proceedings in error. Miami Coun-
ty v. City of Dayton, 92 Ohio St. 179, 110 N.E. 726,
If court's jurisdiction is appellate, it has no authority to
determine a question in an action originally instituted in
it. Rogers v. Leahy, 296 Ky. 44, 176 S.W.2d 93, 95, 149 A.
L.R. 1267.
Exercise of "appellate jurisdiction" involves power not
only to correct errors in judgment under review, but to
make such disposition of causes as justice may require in
order that a correct principle of decision, arising since
judgment appealed from, and having a bearing upon the
right disposition of the cause, may be passed on by trial
court, whose judgment will be vacated and cause remanded
for further proceeding to that end in proper cases. Yates
v. St. Johns Beach Development Co., 122 Fla. 141, 165 So.
384, 385.

## APPELLATIO

Lat. An appeal.

## APPELLATOR

An old law term having the
same meaning as "appellant" (q. v.).
In the civil law, the term was applied to the
judge ad quem, or to whom an appeal was taken.
Calvin.

## APPELLEE

The party in a cause against whom
an appeal is taken; that is, the party who has
an interest adverse to setting aside or reversing
the judgment. Slayton v. Horsey, 97 Tex. 341, 78
S.W. 919. Sometimes also called the "respond-
ent.
In a nontechnical sense, "appellee" may include a de-
fendant in writ of error. Widgins v. Norfolk & W. Ry.
Co., 142 Va. 419, 128 S.E. 516, 518.
In old English law. Where a person charged with trea-
son or felony pleaded guilty and turned approver or
"king's evidence," and accused another as his accomplice
in the same crime, in order to obtain his own pardon, the
one so accused was called the "appellee." 4 Bl.Comm. 330.

## APPELLO

Lat. In the civil law. I appeal.
The form of making an appeal apud acta. Dig.
49, 1, 2.

## APPELLOR

In old English law. A criminal
who accuses his accomplices, or who challenges a
jury. See Approver.

## APPEND

To add or attach. American Cannel
Coal Co. v. Indiana Cotton Mills, 78 Ind.App.
115, 134 N.E. 891, 893.

## APPENDAGE

Something added as an accessory
to or the subordinate part of another thing.
American Cannel Coal Co. v. Indiana Cotton Mills,
78 Ind.App. 115, 134 N.E. 891, 893.
An "appendage" for a schoolhouse includes a well on
the school premises. Schofield v. School Dist. No. 113,
Labette County, 105 Kan. 343, 184 P. 480, 481, 7 A.L.R. 788.
But "appendages" of a railroad do not include Liberty
bonds pledged to indemnify a surety on its appeal bond, or
cash which was not indispensable to enjoyment of the
property nor to its operation. Jackman v. St. Louis & H.
R. Co., 304 Mo. 319, 263 S.W. 230, 231.
to another thing and passing with it; a thing of
inheritance belonging to another inheritance
Which is more worthy; as an advowson, common,
etc., which may be appendant to a manor, com-
mon of fishing to a freehold, a seat in a church
to a house, etc. It differs from appurtenance, in
that appendant must ever be by prescription, i. e.,
a personal usage for a considerable time, while an
appurtenance may be created at this day; for
if a grant be made to a man and his heirs, of
common in such a moor for his beasts levant or
couchant upon his manor, the commons are ap-
purtenant to the manor, and the grant will pass
them. Meek v. Breckenridge, 29 Ohio St. 648.
See Appurtenance.

## APPENDITIA

The appendages or appurte-
nances of an estate or house, dwelling, etc.; thus,
pent-houses are the appenditia domes. Cowell.

## APPENDIX

A printed volume, used on an ap-
peal to the English house of lords or privy coun-
cil, containing the documents and other evidence
presented in the inferior court and referred to in
the cases made by the parties for the appeal.
Answering in some respects to the "paper-book"
or "case" in American practice.

## APPENSURA

Payment of money by weight in-
stead of by count. Cowell.

## APPERTAIN

To belong to; to have relation
to; to be appurtenant to. Chattel mortgages,
Ferguson v. Steen, Tex.Civ.App., 293 S.W. 318,
320; landlord and tenant, State v. Bodden, 166
Wis. 219, 164 N.W. 1009, 1011. To be used in con-
nection with (sales contract), McVeety v. Hayes,
111 Wash. 457, 191 P. 401, 402. See, also, Appur-
tenance; Appurtenant.

## APPERTAINING

Connected with in use or oc-
cupancy. It does not necessarily import contigui-
ty, as does "adjoining," and is therefore not synon-
ymous with it: Miller v. Mann, 55 Vt. 475, 479.
Peculiar to (sale of goods), Herndon v. Moore, 18
S.C. 339.

## APPLE CIDER VINEGAR

Vinegar made from

When a constitution or court declares that the common
law is in force in a particular state so far as it is applica-
ble, it is meant that it must be applicable to the habits and
conditions of the community, as well as in harmony with
the genius, the spirit, and the objects of their institutions.
Wagner v. Bissell, 3 Iowa 402.
When a constitution prohibits the enactment of local or
special laws in all cases where a general law would be ap-
plicable, a general law should always be construed to be
applicable, in this sense, where the entire people of the
state have an interest in the subject. But where only a
portion of the people are affected, as in locating a county-
seat, it will depend upon the facts and circumstances of
each particular case whether such a law would be applica-
ble. Evans v. Job, 8 Nev. 322.

## APPLICABLE LOCAL LAW

Term used to deter-
mine the persons who come within the term heirs
and is the law which would be used to ascertain
the heirs of the designated ancestor if he had

ware Dredging Co. v. Tucker Stevedoring Co., C.C.A.Pa.,
25 F.2d 44, 46.
Purchase Money
The disposition made of the funds received by
a trustee on a sale of real estate held under the

## APPLY

To make a formal request or petition,
usually in writing, to a court, officer, board, or
company, for the granting of some favor, or of
some rule or order, which is within his or their
power or discretion. For example, to apply for
an injunction, for a pardon, for a policy of insur-

in interstate commerce. When discussing the use made of
a statute, in referring to the process by which the statute
is made operative; as where the jury is told to "apply"
the statute of limitation if they find that the cause of ac-
tion arose before a given date. Brandeis, J., dissenting in
Dahnke-Walker Milling Co. v. Bondurant, 42 S.Ct. 106, 110,

is given to one person, officer, or body to name persons
to hold certain offices. State v. Doss, 102 W.Va. 162, 134
S.E. 749. It is usually distinguished from "elect," meaning
to choose by a vote of the qualified voters of the city.
State ex rel. Smith v. Bowman, 184 Mo.App. 549, 170 S.W.
700, 701. But the distinction is not invariably observed.

estate. 2 Washb.Real Prop. 302; Merchants'
Loan & Trust Co. v. Patterson, 308 Ill. 519, 139
N.E. 912, 919. The act of a person in directing
the disposition of property, by limiting a use, or
by substituting a new use for a former one, in
pursuance of a power granted to him for that
purpose by a preceding deed, called a "power of
appointment;" also the deed or other instrument
by which he so conveys. Where the power em-
braces several permitted objects, and the appoint-
ment is made to one or more of them, excluding
others, it is called "exclusive."
Appointment may signify an appropriation of
money to a specific purpose. Harris v. Clark, 3
N.Y. 93, 119, 51 Am.Dec. 352. See Illusory Ap-
pointment. It may also mean the arranging of a

in the nature of a vote, participated in by the public gen-
erally or by the entire class of persons qualified to express
their choice in this manner. Mono County v. Industrial
Ace. Commission, 175 Cal. 752, 167 P. 377, 378.

McChesney, 235 Ky. 692, 32 S.W.2d 26, 27.

ment is made. 1 Steph.Comm. 506, 507; 4 Kent,
Comm. 316.
One authorized by the donor, under the statute
of uses, to execute a power. 2 Bouv.Inst. n. 1923.
The appointor is the instrument of the donor of the
power, and the appointee takes under the original will or
instrument which creates the trust, and not from the donee
of the power. Barret v. Berea College, 48 R.I. 258, 137 A.
145, 147.

ceed in a judicial way. On the other hand, an
appraisal or valuation is generally a mere auxil-
iary feature of a contract of sale, the purpose of
which is not to adjudicate a controversy but to
avoid one. Thompson v. Newman, 36 Cal.App.
248, 171 P. 982, 983.

## APPRAISER

year for specified object or demand against state.
State ex rel. Murray v. Carter, 167 Okl. 473, 30
P.2d 700, 702.
An element of the definition of "appropriation" is that
the money appropriated be out of the general revenues of
the state. Black and White Taxicab Co. v. Standard Oil
Co., 25 Ariz. 381, 218 P. 139, 144. An "expenditure" is the
expending, a laying out of money, disbursement, and is not
the same as an "appropriation," the setting apart or as-
signment to a particular person or use. Grout v. Gates,
97 Vt. 434, 124 A. 76, 80; Suppiger v. Eniking, 60 Idaho
292, 91 P.2d 362, 364, 365.
A specific appropriation is an act of the legisla-
ture by which a named sum of money has been
set apart in the treasury, and devoted to the pay-
ment of a particular demand. Stratton v. Green,

Appropriation of land. The act of selecting, de-
voting, or setting apart land for a particular use
or purpose, as where land is appropriated for pub-
lic buildings, military reservations, or other pub-
lic uses. McSorley v. Hill, 2 Wash.St. 638, 27 Pac.
552; Jackson v. Wilcox, 2 Ill. 360. Taking of pri-
vate property for public use in the exercise of the
power of eminent domain. N. Ward Co. v. Board
of Street Com'rs of City of Boston, 217 Mass. 381,
104 N.E. 965, 966. In this sense it may refer mere-
ly to physical occupation and contemplate pay-
ment prior thereto, in contra-distinction to "tak-
ing," referring to a legal taking and presupposing
payment after damages are due. Keller v. City
of Bridgeport, 101 Conn, 669, 127 A. 508, 511.
Appropriation of payments. The application of
a payment to the discharge of a particular debt.
Thus, if a creditor has two distinct debts due to him
from his debtor, and the latter makes a general payment
on account, without specifying at the time to which debt
he intends the payment to apply, it is optional for the
creditor to appropriate (apply) the payment to either of
the two debts he pleases. Gwin v. McLean, 62 Miss. 121;
Martin v. Draher, 5 Watts (Pa.) 544.
Appropriation of water. An appropriation of
water flowing on the public domain consists in
the capture, impounding, or diversion of it from
its natural course or channel and its actual appli-
cation to some beneficial use private or personal
to the appropriator, to the entire exclusion (or
exclusion to the extent of the water appropriated)
of all other persons. To constitute a valid ap-
propriation, there must be an intent to apply the
water to some beneficial use existing at the time
or contemplated in the future, a diversion from
the natural channel by means of a ditch or canal,
or some other open physical act of taking posses-
sion of the water, and an actual application of it
within a reasonable time to some useful or bene-
ficial purpose. In re Water Rights in Silvies
River, 115 Or. 27, 237 P. 322, 336; In re Manse

Justesen v. Olsen, 40 P.2d 802, 809, 86 Utah 158; and en-
titles appropriator to continuing right to use water to ex-
tent of appropriation, but not beyond that reasonably re-
quired and actually used. State of Arizona v. State of
California, Ariz. & Cal., 56 S.Ct. 848, 852, 298 U.S. 558, 80
L.Ed. 1331.

## APT TDIE

Apt time sometimes depends upon
lapse of time; as, where a thing is required to be

cannot be done afterwards. But the phrase more
usually refers to the order of proceedings, as fit
or suitable. Holmes Electric Co. v. Carolina
Power & Light Co., 150 S.E. 621, 623, 197 N.C. 766.

## AQUILIAN LAW

See Lex Aquilia,
ARABANT. They plowed. A term of feudal law,
applied to those who held by the tenure of plow-
ing and tilling the lord's lands within the manor.
Cowell.

## ARABLE LAND

## ARBITER

A person chosen to decide a contro-
versy; an arbitrator, referee. A person bound
to decide according to the rules of law and equity,
as distinguished from an arbitrator, who may
proceed wholly at his own discretion, so that it
be according to the judgment of a sound man.
Cowell.
In the Roman law. A judge invested with a
discretionary power. A person appointed by the
praetor to examine and decide that class of causes
or actions termed "bona fidei," and who had the
power of judging according to the principles of
equity, (ex cequo et bono; ) distinguished from
the judex, ( q. v.,) who was bound to decide ac-
cording to strict law. Inst. 4, 6, 30, 31.
According to Mr. Abbott, the distinction is as follows:
"Arbitrator" is a technical name of a person selected with
reference to an established system for friendly determina-
tion of controversies, which, though not judicial, is yet
regulated by law; so that the powers and duties of the
arbitrator, when once he is chosen, are prescribed by law,
and his doings may be judicially revised if he has exceeded
his authority. "Arbiter" is an untechnical designation of
a person to whom a controversy is referred, irrespective
of any law to govern the decision ; and is the proper word
to signify a referee of a question outside of or above mu-
nicipal law. But it is elsewhere said that the distinction
between arbiters and arbitrators is not observed in modern
law. Russ.Arb. 112.

## ARBITRAGE

Transactions of bankers and mer-
cantile houses by which stocks or bills are bought

A just arbitration renders to every one
his own. Noy, Max. 248.

## ARBITRARILY

See Arbitrary.
A finding that certain orders were "arbitrarily" given by
an engineer in charge of a public improvement did not
amount to a finding that they were given in bad faith,
fraudulently, or through ignorance or incompetency. First
Savings & Trust Co. v. Milwaukee County, 158 Wis. 207, 148
N.W. 22, 33.

## ARBITRARINESS

Conduct or acts based alone
upon one's will, and not upon any course of rea-
soning and exercise of judgment. Garman v. My-
ers, 183 Okl. 141, 80 P.2d 624, 626.

## ARBITRARY

as fixed or done capriciously or at pleasure; with-
out adequate determining principle; not founded
in the nature of things; nonrational; not done or

ing on the will alone; absolutely in power; ca-
priciously; tyrannical; despotic; Cornell v.
Swisher County, Tex.Civ.App., 78 S.W.2d 1072,
1074. Without fair, solid, and substantial cause;
that is, without cause based upon the law. U. S.
v. Lotempio, D.C.N.Y., 58 F.2d 358, 359; not gov-
erned by any fixed rules or standard. People ex
rel. Hultman v. Gilchrist, 188 N.Y.S. 61, 65, 114
Misc. 651.

## ARBITRARY GOVERNMENT

The difference be-
tween a free and an arbitrary government is that
in the former limits are assigned to those to whom
the administration is committed, but the latter
depends on the will of the departments or some
of them. Kamper v. Hawkins, 1 Va.Cas. 20, 23.

## ARBITRARY POWER

Power to act according to
one's own will; especially applicable to power
conferred on an administrative officer, who is not
furnished any adequate determining principle.

F.2d 715, 727.

## ARBITRARY PUNISHMENT

which is left to the decision of the judge, in dis-
tinction from those defined by statute.

## ARBITRATION

The submission for determina-
tion of disputed matter to private unofficial per-
sons selected in manner provided by law or agree-
ment. Stockwell v. Equitable Fire & Marine Ins.
Co., 25 P.2d 873, 134 Cal.App. 534. The substitu-
tion of their award or decision for judgment of
a court. In re Curtis-Castle Arbitration, 64 Conn.
501, 30 A. 769, 42 Am.St.Rep. 200; Atlantic Fruit
Cross Line v. Atlantic Fruit Co., 44 S.Ct. 274, 264
U.S. 109, 68 L.Ed. 582.
Compulsory arbitration is that which occurs when the
consent of one of the parties is enforced by statutory pro-
visions. Wood v. City of Seattle, 23 Wash. 1, 62 Pac. 135,
52 L.R.A. 369.
Voluntary arbitration Is by mutual and free consent of
the parties.
The submission is an agreement by which parties agree
to submit their differences to the decision of a referee or
arbitrators. It is sometimes termed a reference. 3 M. &
W. 816; McManus v. McCulloch, 6 Watts (Pa.) 357; Ste-
wart v. Cass, 16 Vt. 663, 42 Am. Dec. 534; Howard v. Sex-
ton, 4 N.Y. 157. As to "final submission," see In re Gitt,
125 N.Y.S. 369, 140 App.Div. 382. In a wide sense, "arbi-
tration" may embrace the whole method of thus settling
controversies, and include all the various steps. But in a
more strict use, the term denotes only the submission and
hearing, the decision being separately spoken of, and called
an "award." An award is the judgment or decision of ar-
bitrators or referees on a matter submitted to them. It is
also the writing containing such judgment. Cowell;
Termes de la Ley; Jenk. 137. See Award.
As distinguished from appraisal, an arbitration presup-
poses a controversy or a difference to be tried and decided.
On the other hand, an appraisal or valuation is generally a
mere auxiliary feature, as of a contract of sale, the pur-
pose of which is not to adjudicate a controversy but to
avoid one. Toledo S. S. Co. v. Zenith Transp. Co., 184 F.
391, 106 C.C.A. 501.

## ARBITRATION CLAUSE

A clause inserted in
a contract providing for compulsory arbitration
in case of dispute as to rights or liabilities under
it; ineffectual if it purports to oust the courts of
jurisdiction entirely. See Perry v. Cobb, 88 Me.
435, 34 A. 278, 49 L.R.A. 389.

## ARBITRATION OF EXCHANGE

This takes
place where a merchant pays his debts in one
country by a bill of exchange upon another.
The business of buying and selling exchange (bills of ex-
change) between two or more countries or markets, and
particularly where the profits of such business are to be
derived from a calculation of the relative value of ex-
change in the two countries or markets, and by taking ad-
vantage of the fact that the rate of exchange may be high-
er in the one place than in the other at the same time.

## ARBITRATOR

A private, disinterested person,
chosen by the parties to a disputed question, for
the purpose of hearing their contention, and giv-
ing judgment between them; to whose decision
(award) the litigants submit themselves either
voluntarily, or, in some cases, compulsorily, by
order of a court. Fudickar v. Insurance Co., 62
N.Y. 399.
"Referee" is of frequent modern use as a synonym of
arbitrator, but is in its origin of broader signification and
less accurate than arbitrator.

## ARBITRIOS

In Spanish and Mexican law. Tax-
es imposed by municipalities on certain articles
of merchandise, to defray the general expenses
of government, in default of revenues from "pro-
prios" (q. v.), e., lands owned by the municipali-
ty, or the income of which was legally set apart
for its support. Sometimes used in a wider sense,
as meaning the resources of a town, including its
privileges in the royal lands as well as the taxes.

854; Smith v. City Council of Augusta, 203 Ga.

drawn from what is inconvenient is good in law,
because the law will not permit any inconvenience.
Co.Litt. 66a, 258.
ARGUMENTUM AB INCONVENIENT! PLURI-
MUM VALET [EST VALIDUM] IN LEGE. An
argument drawn from inconvenience is of the
any deed or instrument equivocal expressions, and
great inconvenience must necessarily follow from
one construction, it is strong to show that such
construction is not according to the true intention
of the grantor; but where there is no equivocal
expression in the instrument, and the words used
admit only of one meaning, arguments of incon-
venience prove only want of foresight in the

An armistice differs from a mere "suspension of arms"
(q. v.) in that the latter is concluded for very brief periods
and for local military purposes onV, whereas an armistice
not only covers a longer period, 'but is agreed upon for
political purposes. It is said to be general if it relates to

tion.

person by arresting officer or submission to offi-
cer's authority and control is necessary to con-
stitute an "arrest." Thompson v. Boston Pub. Co.,
285 Mass. 344, 189 N.E. 210, 213. It is a restraints

As ordinarily used, tAe terms arrest and attachment coin-
cide in meaning to some extent; though in strictness, as
a distinction, an arrest may be said to be the act resulting
from the service of an attachment. And in the more ex-
tended sense which is sometimes given to attachment, in-
cluding the act of taking, it would seem to differ from ar-
rest in that it is more peculiarly applicable to a taking of
property, while arrest is more commonly used in speaking
of persons.
Arrest is also applied in some instances to a seizure and,
detention of personal chattels, especially of ships and ves-
sels; thus, in admiralty actions a ship or cargo is arrested
when the marshal has served the writ in an action in rem.
Pelham v. Rose, 9 Wall. 103, 19 L. Ed. 602.
Civil Practice
The apprehension of a person by virtue of a
lawful authority to answer the demand against
him in a civil action. Gentry v. Griffith, 27 Tex.
Criminal Cases
The apprehending or detaining of the person in
order to be forthcoming to answer an alleged or
suspected crime. Ex parte Sherwood, 29 Tex.App.
334, 15 S.W. 812.
The word arrest is said to be more properly used in civil
cases, and apprehension in criminal. Thus, a man is ar-
rested under a capias ad respondendum, and apprehended
under a warrant charging him with larceny.
Malicious Arrest
An arrest made willfully and without probable
cause, but in the course of a regular proceeding.
Parol Arrest
One ordered by a judge or magistrate from the
bench, without written complaint or other pro-
ceedings, of a person who is present before him,
and which is executed on the spot; as in case of
breach of the peace in open court.
Rearrest
Right of an officer to take without warrant one
escaping in any manner, Hefler v. Hunt, 120 Me.
10, 112 A. 675, or violating parole, Massey v. Cun-
ningham, 169 Ark. 410, 275 S.W. 737, or failing
to respond to bond for appearance, Porter v. Gar-
mony, 148 Ga. 261, 96 S.E. 426.
Second Arrest
The "second arrest" forbidden after discharge
on habeas corpus means an imprisonment based
on the same information and not under a new
information followed by a lawful warrant. State

Stair v. Heska Amone Congregation, 128 Tenn.
190, 159 S.W. 840, 841.

trate, directed to a peace officer or some other
person specially named, and commanding him to

## ARREST OF JUDGMENT

The act of staying a
judgment, or refusing .to render judgment in -an
action at law and in criminal cases, after ver-
dict, for some matter intrinsic appearing on
the face of the record, which. would render the
judgment, if -given, erroneous or reversible. 3 Bl.
Comm. 393; 3 Steph.Comm. 628; 2 Tidd, Pr. 918;
Speer v. Pierce, 18 Tenn.App. 351, 77 S.W.2d 77,
78; State v. Ferguson, 165 Tenn. 61, 52 S.W.2d
It is the fact that a motion in arrest of judgment is
based on some defect on the face of the record or pleadings
which aids in distinguishing it from a motion for a new
trial. Maddox Coffee Co. v. McHan, 22 Ga.App. 198, 95 S.
E. 736. It differs also from a motion to set aside a judg-
ment, in that a motion in arrest of judgment must be
made during the term when the judgment was rendered.
Love v. National Liberty Ins. Co., 157 Ga. 259, 121 S.E.
648, 650. A motion in arrest of judgment is practically a
demurrer, People v. Cordosco, 77 Cal.App. 780, 246 P. 461,
462, and has been abolished in some jurisdictions. State
v. Sharp, Mo.Sup., 300 S.W. 501.

## ARRIVAL

In marine insurance, arrival of a ves-
sel means an arrival for purposes of business, re-
quiring an entry and clearance and stay at the
port so long as to require some of the acts con-
nected with business, and not merely touching at
a port for advices, or to ascertain the state of the
market, or being driven in by an adverse wind
and sailing again as soon as it changes. F. S.
Royster Guano Co. v. U. S., C.C.A.Va., 18 F.2d 469,
"A vessel arrives at a port of discharge when she comes,
or is brought, to a place where it is intended to discharge
her, and where is the usual and customary place of dis-
charge. When a vessel is insured to one or two ports, and
sails for one, the risk terminates on her arrival there. If a
vessel is insured to a particular port of discharge, and is
destined to discharge cargo successively at two different
wharves, docks, or places, within that port, each being a
distinct place for the delivery of cargo, the risk ends when
she has been moored twenty-four hours in safety at the
first place. But if she is destined to one or more places for
the delivery of cargo, and delivery or discharge of a por-
tion of her cargo is necessary, not by reason of her hav-
ing reached any destined place of delivery, but as a neces-
sary and usual nautical measure, to enable her to reach
such usual and destined place of delivery, she cannot prop-
erly be considered as having arrived at the usual and custo-
mary place of discharge, when she is at anchor for the
purpose only of using such means as will better enable her
to reach it. If she cannot get to the destined and usual
place of discharge in the port because she is too deep, and
must be lightered to get there, and, to aid in prosecuting
the voyage, cargo is thrown overboard or put into
lighters, such discharge does not make that the place of
arrival; it is only a stopping-place in the voyage. When
the vessel is insured to a particular port of discharge, ar-
rival within the limits of the harbor does not terminate
the risk, if the place is not one where vessels are dis-
charged and voyages completed. The policy covers the
vessel through the port navigation, as well as on the open
sea, until she reaches the destined place." Simpson v. In-
surance Co., Holmes, 137, Fed.Cas.No.12,886.
"Arrival of ship," within meaning of bills of lading re-
quiring claims to be filed, must be construed, where MIS-
delivery is charged, as meaning date when cargo is dis-
charged or offered for delivery. The Cardiganshire, D.C.
Cal., 9 F.2d 416, 420. "Arrival" within the immigration
laws means compliance with the requirements entitling an
alien to entry. See 8 USCA §§ 106, 380. In re Kempson, D.
C.Wash., 14 F.2d 668, 669.

## ARRIVE

To come to a particular place; to reach
a particular or certain place. Thompson v. U. S.,
1 Brock. 411, Fed.Cas.No.13,985; 8 B. & C. 119.
The words "arrive" and "enter" are not always synony-
mous; there certainly may be an arrival without an actual
entry or attempt to enter. United States v. Open Boat, 5
Mason, 120, 132, Fed.Cas.No.15,967. And where a vessel
from a foreign port, laden with liquors, anchored within
four leagues of the coast, and the master without a permit
therefor allowed part of the cargo to be taken away, with
the intention of so disposing of the entire cargo, the vessel
ARROGATION. In the civil law. The adoption

## ARSON

684, 686; Commonwealth v. Cooper, 264 Mass.
378, 162 N.E. 733, 734.

it is now an offense to burn one's own house under the
statutes of New Hampshire, Arkansas, California, and oth-
er states. State v. Blumenthal, 136 Ark. 532, 203 S.W.
36, 37, L.R.A.1918E, 482.
Whether "house" or "dwelling house" be used in statute
defining the crime may be of importance in determining
whether occupancy is or is not an element. 1 Hale, P.C.
566, 567; Commonwealth v. Barney, 64 Mass. (10 Cush.)
478. Some states have expressly eliminated occupancy as
an element, State v. Snover, 101 N.J.Law, 543, 126 A. 850 ;
P.L. 1919, p. 257; while others have made it a distinction
between degrees of the crime, People v. Abrams, 174 Cal.
172, 162 P. 395, 396.
In several states, this crime is divided into arson in the
first, second, and third degrees, the first degree including
the burning of an inhabited dwelling-house in the night-
time; the second degree, the burning (at night) of a build-
ing other than a dwelling-house, but so situated with ref-
erence to a dwelling-house as to endanger it; the third
degree, the burning of any building or structure not the
subject of arson in the first or second degree, or the burn-
ing of property, his own or another's with intent to de-
fraud or prejudice an insurer thereof. State v. Jessup, 42
Kan. 422, 22 P. 627.

skill in effecting a desired result; also an em-
ployment, occupation or business requiring such

718, L.R.A.1915A, 1088. A principle put in practice
and applied to some art, machine, manufacture,

Mason, 1, Fed.Cas.No.4,247.
In the law of patents, this term means a useful
art or manufacture which is beneficial and which
is described with exactness in its mode of opera-
tion. Such an art can be protected only in the
mode and to the extent thus described. Jacobs
v. Baker, 7 Wall. 297, 19 L.Ed. 200. It is synonym-
ous with process or method when used to produce
a useful result, and may be either a force applied,
a mode of application, or the specific treatment of
a specific object, and must produce physical ef-
fects. Emmett v. Metals Processing Corporation,
C.C.A.Ariz., 118 F.2d 796, 798.

ple assault and battery" is an unlawful act of vio-
lent injury to another, unaccompanied by any cir-
cumstances of aggravation. State v. Jones, 133

the benefit received.
Taxation
The listing and valuation of property for the
purpose of apportioning a tax upon it, either ac-
cording to value alone or in proportion to benefit
received. Also determining the share of a tax
to be paid by each of many persons; or apportion-
ing the entire tax to be levied among the different
taxable persons, establishing the proportion due
from each. Town of Albertville v. Hooper, 196
Ala. 642, 72 So. 258. Northwestern Imp. Co. v.
Henneford, 184 Wash. 502, 51 P.2d 1083, 1085.

"Assessment" and "levy" are frequently used inter-
changeably. Huyler v. Huyler's, 44 N.Y.S.2d 255, 257.
Though properly speaking it does not include the levy of
taxes. Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Patrick Cud-
ahy Family Co., C.C.A.7, 102 F.2d 930, 932. Assessment is
also popularly used as synonym for taxation in general, the
authorative imposition of a rate or duty to be paid, but
in its technical signification it is only taxation for a special
purpose or local improvement, local taxation, as distin-
guished from general taxation ; taxation on principle of
apportionment according to the relation between burden
and benefit; whole taxes are impositions for purpose of
general revenue. Collister v. Kovanda, 51 Ohio App. 43,
199 N.E. 477, 478; Home Owners' Loan Corporation v.
Tyson, 133 Ohio St. 184, 12 N.E.2d 478, 480; Atlantic
Coast Line R. Co. v. Town of Ahoskie, 192 N.C. 258, 134
S.E. 653, 654.
An assessment is doubtless a tax, but the term implies
something more; it implies a tax of a particular kind,
predicated upon the principle of equivalents, or benefits,
which are peculiar to the persons or property charged
therewith, and which are said to be assessed or appraised,
according to the measure or proportion of such equiva-
lents; whereas a simple tax is imposed for the purpose of
supporting the government generally, without reference to
any sneci.al advantage which may be supposed to accrue to
the persons taxed. Taxes must be levied, without discrim-
ination, equally upon all the subjects of property ; whilst
assessments are only levied upon lands, or some other
specific property, the subjects of the supposed benefits; to
repay which the assessment is levied. In re Walker River
Irr. Dist., 44 Nev. 321, 195 P. 327, 330.
Corporations
Installments of the money subscribed for shares
of stock, called for from the subscribers by the
directors, from time to time as the company re-
quires money, are called "assessments," or, in
England, "calls." Water Co. v. Superior Court,
92 Cal. 47, 28 Pac. 54, 27 Am.St.Rep. 91; Spangler
v. Railroad Co., 21 Ill. 278; Stewart Publishing
Co., 1 Wash.St. 521, 20 Pac. 605. While the terms
"call" and "assessment" are generally used synon-
ymously, the latter term applies with peculiar apt-
ness to contributions above the par value of stock
or the subscription liability of the stockholders;
Porter v. Northern Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 36 N.D.
199, 161 N.W. 1012, 1014; whereas "call" or "in-
stallments" means action of the board of directors
subscriptions; Seyberth v. American Commander
Min. & Mill. Co., 42 Idaho, 254, 245 P. 392, 395.
It has been said, however, that the superadded liability
of stockholders to creditors, is not in a true sense an
"assessment," but is a "statutory liability." Leach v.
Arthur Say. Bank, 203 Iowa, 1052, 213 N.W. 772, 773.
Damages
Fixing the amount of damages to which the suc-
cessful party in a suit is entitled after an inter-
locutory judgment has been taken; also the name
given to the determination of the sum which a
corporation proposing to take lands for a public
use must pay 4satisfaction of the demand proved
or the value taken.
Insurance
An apportionment made in general average up-
on the various articles and interests at risk, ac-
cording to their value at the time and place of
being in safety, for contribution for damage and
sacrifices purposely made, and expenses incurred
for escape from impending common peril. 2 Phil.
Ins. c. xv.
A sum specially levied in mutual benefit insur-
ance upon a fixed and definite plan within the
limit of the company's or society's fundamental
law of organization to pay losses, or losses and
expenses incurred, being to a certain degree sub-
stantially the equivalent of premiums. Beaver
State Merchants' Mut. Fire Ins. Ass'n v. Smith, 97
Or. 579, 192 P. 798, 800. The periodical demands
made by a mutual insurance company, under its
charter and by-laws, upon the makers of premium
notes, are also denominated "assessments." Hill
v. Insurance Co., 129 Mich. 141, 88 N.W. 392.
Meaning "premiums," Ancient Order of United
Workmen of Kansas v. Hobbs, 136 Kan. 708, 18
P.2d 561, 562; and being the consideration for the
insurance contracts. Downing v. School Dist. of
City of Erie, 297 Pa. 474, 147 A. 239, 240.
Mining
"Assessment" as applied to labor on mining
claims is universally understood to mean the an-
nual labor required by Rev.St.U.S. § 2324 (30 U.S.
C.A. § 28), in order to hold the right to the pos-
session of the claim after a discovery and com-
plete location has been made. Smith v. Union Oil
Co., 166 Cal. 217, 135 P. 966, 969. See Assessment
Work.

fined by the Nebraska insurance laws, does not

ing of extra assessments, if necessary. Western

quired of the locator of a mineral claim after dis-
covery by Rev.St. § 2324 (30 U.S.C.A. § 28), and

## ASSETS

The word, though more generally used
to denote everything which comes to the represen-
tatives of a deceased person, yet is by no means
confined to that use, but has come to signify
everything which can be made available for the
payment of debts, whether belonging to the estate
of a deceased person or not. Hence we speak of
the assets of a bank or other monied corporation,
the assets of an insolvent debtor, and the assets
of an individual or private copartnership; and we
always use this word when we speak of the means
which a party has, as compared with his liabilities
or debts. Pelican v. Rock Falls, 81 Wis. 428, 51
N.W. 871.
Bankruptcy
The property or effects of a bankrupt or insol-
vent, applicable to the payment of his debts.
The term "assets" includes all property of every kind
and nature, chargeable with the debts of the bankrupt,
that comes into-the hands of and under the control of the
signee; and the value thereof is not to be considered a
less sum than that actually realized out of said property,
and received by the assignee for it. In re Taggert, 16
N. B. R. 351, Fed. Cas. No. 13, 725 ; Progressive Building &
Loan Co. v. Hall, C.C.A.Va., 220 F. 45, 46.
Commercial Law
The aggregate of available property, stock in
trade, cash, etc., belonging to a merchant or mer-
cantile company.
The term "assets," as applied to a bank, is broad enough
to cover anything which is or may be available to pay
creditors; but, as usually understood, it refers to the
tangible property of the corporation, and not to the lia-
bility of stockholders contingent upon insolvency. Hill v.
Smathers, 173 N.C. 642, 92 S.E. 607, 609; Deariso v. Mob-
ley, 38 Ga.App. 313, 143 S.E. 915, 920. But when the indi-
vidual liability of stockholders has been enforced by the
superintendent of banks, funds collected by him thereun-
der are "assets." Bennett v. Wilkes County, 164 Ga. 790,
139 S.E. 566, 568.
But on other hand stockholders' voluntary assessment to
relieve bank or for betterment of stock. Thomson v. Holt,
345 Mo. 296, 132 S.W.2d 974, 977; bank stockholders' ha.
bility, Farmers & Merchants Bank of Morgantown v. Bank
of Masontown, 123 W.Va. 451, 15 S.E.2d 569, 572; and bank
directors' contribution to special bond account to make
good shrinkage in regular bond were held to be assets.
Probate Law
Property of a decedent available for the pay
ment of debts and legacies; the estate coming t
the heir or personal representative which i
chargeable, in law or equity, with the obligation
which such heir or representative is required, i
his representative capacity, to discharge.
In an accurate and legal sense, all the personal propert
of the deceased which is of a salable nature. and may b
converted into ready money, is deemed assets. But th
word is not confined to such property; for all other prop
erty of the deceased, real or personal, tangible or intangi
ble, legal or equitable, which can be made available for o
can be appropriated to payment of debts, is, in a larg
sense, assets. Trust Co. v. Earle, 110 U.S. 710, 4 Sup.Ct
231, 28 L.Ed. 30; Condo v. Barbour, 101 Ind.App. 483, 20
N.E. 76; Tapp v. Stuart, D.C.Okl., 6 F.Supp. 577, 578.

the aid and instrumentality of a court of equity, an
because their distribution is governed by a different rul

Jur. § 552.
—Legal assets. See Legal Assets.
—Personal assets. Chattels, money, and oth
personal property belonging to a bankrupt, in
solvent, or decedent estate, which go to the as

tion credit statement merely to distinguish liqui
assets from those permanently invested in th
business, like real estate and machinery, and i
cluded amounts charged against officers for r
turn of part of salaries paid them in a previou
year, in accordance with the agreement of e
ployment. In re American Knit Goods Mfg. Co
C.C.A.N.Y., 173 F. 480, 97 C.C.A. 486.
—Real assets. Lands or real estate in the hand
of an heir, chargeable with the payment of t

## ASSIGNEE

A person to whom an assignment is
made; grantee. Nolan v. City of New York, 39
- N.Y.S.2d 360, 363, 179 Misc. 1011. Ely v. Com'rs,
49 Mich. 17, 12 N.W. 893, 13 N.W. 784. The term
erty; but it is not incorrect, in some cases, to
apply it to realty, e. g., "assignee of the rever-
sion."
Assignee in fact is one to whom an assignment
has- been made in fact by the party having the
right. Tucker v. West, 31 Ark. 643. One to whom
an assignment has been made. Michigan Trust
Co. v. Chaffee, D.C.N.D., 44 F.Supp. 848, 850.
Assignee in law is one in whom the law vests
the right; as an executor or administrator.
Old Law
A person deputed or appointed by another to
do any act, or perform any business. Blount. An
assignee, however, was distinguished from a depu-
ty, being said to occupy a thing in his own right,
while a deputy acted in right of another. Cowell.
ASSIGNEE FOR THE BENEFIT OF CREDITORS.
One to whom, under an insolvent or bankrupt
law, the whole estate of a debtor is transferred
to be administered for the benefit of creditors; he
is a trustee for the creditors who stands in the
shoes of an assignor, and can assert no claim to
property which assignor could not. Slater v.
Oriental Mills, 18 R.I. 352, 27 A. 443, 444; Textor
v. Orr, 86 Md. 392, 38 A. 939, 940.

## ASSIGNMENT

A transfer or making over to
another of the whole of any property, real or
personal, in possession or in action, or of any
estate or right therein. Bostrom v. Bostrom, 60
N.D. 792, 236 N.W. 732, 734. It includes transfers
of all kinds of property, Higgins v. Monckton, 28
Cal.App.2d 723, 83 P.2d 516, 519. But is ordinarily
limited to transfers of choses in action and to
rights in or connected with property, as distin-
guished from the particular item of property. In
re Beffa's Estate, 54 Cal.App. 186, 201 P. 616,
617. It is generally appropriate to the transfer
of equitable interests. Kavanaugh v. Cohoes
Power & Light Corporation, 187 N.Y.S. 216, 228,
114 Misc. 590.
To constitute valid "assignment," there must be per-
fected transaction between parties intended to vest in
assignee present right in thing assigned. In re Lynch's
Estate, 272 N.Y.S. 79, 85, 151 Misc. 549. It is contract, and
is subject to same requisites as to validity as other con-
tracts, such as proper parties, mutual assent, considera-
tion, and legal subject-matter. Hutsell v. Citizens' Nat.
Bank, 166 Tenn. 598, 64 S.W.2d 188.
The transfer of the interest one has in lands
and tenements; more particularly applied to the
unexpired residue of a term or estate for life or
years; Cruise, Dig. tit. xxxii. (Deed) c. vii, § 15;
1 Steph.Com. 507.
The distinction between an "assignment" and a "sub-
lease" is that an assignment transfers the entire unexpired
term. Sandford v. Ambassador Restaurant Co., 247 N.Y.S.
655, 657, 139 Misc. 3.
The deed by which the transfer is made. Hum-
phrey v. Coquillard Wagon Works, 37 Okl. 714,
132 P. 899, 902, 49 L.R.A.,N.S., 600.
A transfer of the title to a bill, note, or check.
An assignment at common law differs from an indorse-
ment in that by an assignment the assignor passed title to
liability, whereas an indorser, in addition to passing title,
impliedly contracts to pay note at maturity on demand and
notice on maker's failure to so do. Johnson v. Beickey, 64
Utah, 43, 228 P. 189, 191.
In patent law, the transfer of the entire interest
in a patented invention or of an undivided portion
of such entire interest as to every section of the
United States. Rob.Pat. § 762. It differs from
grant in relation to the territorial area to which
they relate. A grant is the transfer of the exclu-
sive right in a specific part of the United States.
It is an exclusive sectional right. A license is a
transfer of a less or different interest than either
the interest in a whole patent or an undivided
part of such whole interest or an exclusive sec-
tional interest. Littlefield v. Perry, 21 Wall. 205,
22 L.Ed. 577.
A license is distinguished from an assignment and a
grant in that the latter transfers the monopoly as well as
the invention, while a license transfers only the invention
and does not affect the monopoly otherwise than by estop-
ping the licensor from exercising his prohibitory powers in
derogation of the privileges conferred by him upon the
licensee. Rob. Pat. § 806. See Pope Mfg. Co. v. Mfg. Co.,
144 U.S. 248, 12 S.Ct. 641, 36 L.Ed. 423.
—Assignment for benefit of creditors. An assign-
ment in trust made by insolvent and other debtors
for the payment of their debts. These are usually
regulated by state statutes. Woodard v. Mor-
rissey, 115 Kan. 511, 223 P. 306, 307.
The distinctive test between an "assignment" and a sale,
where another creditor is to be paid off, is that in the
former case such other creditor is to receive some of the
property or its proceeds, and in the latter the creditor to
whom title is passed takes for himself the whole property,
stipulating to pay the other creditor out of his own means
and not out of the property or its proceeds. Silver & Gold-
stein v. Chapman, 163 Ga. 604, 136 S.E. 914, 919.
—Assignment of account. Transfer to assignee
giving him a right to have moneys when collected
applied to payment of his debt. Nanny v. H. E.
Pogue Distillery Co., 56 Cal.App.2d 817, 133 P.2d
686, 688.
—Assignment of dower. The act by which the
share of a widow in her deceased husband's real
estate is ascertained and set apart to her. Bettis
v. McNider, 137 Ala. 588, 34 So. 813, 97 Am.St.Rep.
—Assignment of error. See Error.
—Assignment pro tanto. Where an order is drawn
upon a third party and made- payable out of a
particular fund then due or to become due to the
drawer, the delivery of the order to the payee
operates as an assignment pro tanto of the fund.
Doyle v. East New York Say. Bank, 44 N.Y.S.2d
318, 323.
Under Mechanics' Lien Law a workman or materialman
who serves on owner a stop notice becomes an assignee
pro tanto of debt due from owner to contractor. Common-
wealth Roofing Co. v. Riccio, 81 N.J.Eq. 486, 87 A. 114,
Check drawn on a bank operates as an assignment pro
tanto of depositor's funds in favor of holder. Nat. Bank
of America v. Indiana Banking Co., 114 Ill. 483, 2 N.E. 401.
—Assignment with preferences. An assignment
for the benefit of creditors, with directions to the
creditors, by paying their claims in full before
the others receive any dividend, or in some other
manner. More usually termed a "preferential
assignment."
—Foreign assignment. An assignment made in a
foreign country, or in another state. 2 Kent,
Comm. 405, et seq.
—General assignment. An assignment made for
the benefit of all the assignor's creditors, instead
of a few only; or one which transfers the whole
of his estate to the assignee, instead of a part
only. Royer Wheel Co. v. Fielding, 101 N.Y. 504,
5 N.E. 431.
—Voluntary assignment. An assignment for the
benefit of his creditors made by a debtor volun-
tarily; as distinguished from a compulsory as-
signment which takes place by operation of law
in proceedings in bankruptcy or insolvency. Pre-
sumably it means an assignment of a debtor's
property in trust to pay his debts generally, in
distinction from a transfer of property to a par-
ticular creditor in payment of his demand, or to a
conveyance by way of collateral security or mort-
gage. Dias v. Bouchaud, 10 Paige (N.Y.) 445.

except in the phrase, in deeds, "heirs, administra-

Minn. 119, 198 N.W. 127. It generally comprehends
all those who take either immediately or remotely
from or under the assignor, whether by convey-
ance, devise, descent, or act of law. Ferrell v.
Deverick, 100 S.E. 850, 853, 85 W.Va. 1.

181 A. 73, 74. Also taking up, receiving, adopting,
taking to oneself, or to put on deceitfully, take
appearance of, affect, or outwardly seem. Nickell
v. State, 205 Wis. 614, 238 N.W. 508, 510. To take
on, become bound as another is bound, or put one-
self in place of another as to an obligation or lia-
bility. Texas Employers' Ins. Ass'n v. Texas & P.

## ASSUMED RISK

See Assumption of Risk.

## ASSUMPSIT

Lat. He undertook; he promised.
A promise or engagement by which one person
assumes or undertakes to do some act or pay
something to another. It may be either oral or
in writing, but is not under seal. It is express if
the promisor puts his engagement in distinct and
definite language; it is implied where the law
infers a promise (though no formal one has
passed) from the conduct of the party or the cir-
cumstances of the case. Dukes v. Rogers, 67 Ga.
App. 661, 21 S.E.2d 295, 297.
Practice
A form of action which lies for the recovery
of damages for the non-performance of a parol
or simple contract; or a contract that is neither
of record nor under seal. 7 Term. 351; Ballard v.
Walker, 3 Johns. Cas. (N.Y.) 60. A liberal and
equitable action, applicable to almost every case
where money has been received which in equity
and good conscience ought to be refunded; ex-
press promise is not necessary to sustain action,
but it may be maintained whenever anything is
received or done from the circumstances of which
the law implies a promise of compensation. Ar-
mour & Co. v. Whitney & Kemmerer, Inc., 164
Va. 12, 178 S.E. 889, 98 A.L.R. 596.
Express assumpsit. See Express Assumpsit
Special assumpsit is an action of assumpsit
brought upon an express contract or promise.
General (common or indebitatus) assumpsit is
an action of assumpsit brought upon the promise
or contract implied by law in certain cases. It is
founded upon what the law terms an implied
good conscience, he is bound to pay to plaintiff.
Tr. and Ha. Pr. 1490; Ruse v. Williams, 14 Ariz
445, 130 P. 887, 888, 45 L.R.A.,N.S., 923.
The action of assumpsit differs from trespass and trover,
which are founded on a tort, not upon a contract; from
covenant and debt, which are appropriate where the
ground of recovery is a sealed instrument, or special obli-
gation to pay a fixed sum; and from replevin which seeks
the recovery of specific property, if attainable, rather than
' of damages.

## ASSUMPSIT FOR MONEY HAD AND RE- CEIVED

Is of equitable character and lies, in
general, whenever defendant has received money
which in equity and good conscience he ought to
pay to plaintiff. Henderson v. Koenig, 192 Mo.
690, 91 S.W. 88, 91.

## ASSUMPSIT ON QUANTUM MERUIT

When a
person employs another to do work for him, with-
out any agreement as to his compensation, the law
implies a promise from the employer to the work-
man that he will pay him for his services as much
as he may deserve or merit. In such case, the
plaintiff may suggest in his declaration that the
defendant promised to pay him as much as he
reasonably deserved, and then aver that his trouble
was worth such a sum of money, which the de-
fendant has omitted to pay. This is called an
"assumpsit on quantum meruit". Travis v. Ken-
nedy, Tex.Civ.App., 66 S.W.2d 444, 446.

## ASSUMPTION

The act of conceding or taking
for granted. Gordon v. Schellhorn, 95 N.J.Eq. 563,
123 A. 549, 552.
The term is substantially synonymous with "inference,"
"probability," and "presumption." Ohio Bldg. Safety
Vault Co. v. Industrial Board of Illinois, 277 Ill. 96, 115
N.E. 149, 154.
The act or agreement of assuming or taking
upon one's self; the undertaking or adoption of a
debt or obligation primarily resting upon another,
as where the purchaser of real estate "assumes"
a mortgage resting upon it, in which case he adopts
the mortgage debt as his own and becomes per-
sonally liable for its payment. Lenz v. Railroad
Co., 111 Wis. 198, 86 N.W. 607; Bell Telephone
Co. of Pennsylvania v. Public Service Commission
of Pennsylvania, 119 Pa.Super. 292, 181 A. 73, 75.
The difference between the purchaser of land assuming
a mortgage on it and simply buying subject to the mort-
gage, is that In the former case he makes himself per-
sonally liable for the payment of the mortgage debt, while
in the latter case he does not. Hancock v. Fleming, 103
Ind. 533, 3 N.E. 254. When he takes the conveyance sub-
ject to the mortgage, he is bound only to the extent of
the property. Brichetto v. Raney, 76 Cal.App. 232, 245 P.
235, 241. Where one "assumes" a lease, he takes to him-
self the obligations, contracts, agreements, and benefits to
which the other contracting party was entitled under the
terms of the lease. Cincinnati, etc., R. Co. v. Indiana, etc.,
R. Co., 44 Ohio St. 287, 314, 7 N.E. 152.

## ASSUMPTION OF INDEBTEDNESS

Means for
one person to bind himself to pay debt incurred by
another. Pawnee County Excise Board v. Kurn,
187 Oki. 110, 101 P.2d 614, 618.

## ASSUMPTION OF RISK

Exists where none of
fault for injury rests with plaintiff, but where
plaintiff assumes consequences of injury occurring
of no one. Rodgers v. Stoller, 284 Ky. 108, 143 S.
W.2d 1047, 1048. It is based upon the maxim
"volenti non fit injuria," which means that to
which a person assents is not regarded in law as
an injury. Poole v. Lutz & Schmidt, 273 Ky.
586, 117 S.W.2d 575, 576. And predicated upon
knowledge and consent. Kansas City Southern
Ry. Co. v. Diggs, 205 Ark. 150, 167 S.W.2d 879,
883. While more generally used as between mas-
ter and servant, courts do not confine it to such
relationship. Adams' Adm'r v. Callis & Hughes,
253 Ky. 382, 69 S.W.2d 711, 712.
Doctrine held applicable in action by automobile guest
passenger. Gill v. Arthur, 69 Ohio App. 386, 43 N.E.2d 894,
899. But held not applicable in automobile collision cases
generally. Schubring v. Weggen, 234 Wis. 517, 291 N.W.
788, 789, 790, 791.
In some jurisdictions, doctrine confined to master
and servant relation. Dowse v. Maine Cent. R. R.,
91 N.H. 419, 20 A.2d 629, 631; Parker v. Grand
Trunk Western R. Co., 261 Mich. 293, 246 N.W.
125, 126; West Texas Utilities Co. v. Reuner, Tex.,
32 S.W.2d 264, 270. A term or condition in a con-
tract of employment, either express or implied
from the circumstances of the employment, by
which the employee agrees that dangers of injury
ordinarily or obviously incident to the discharge
of his duty in the particular employment shall be
at his own risk. Parker v. City of Wichita, 150
Kan. 249, 92 P.2d 86, 89; Wisconsin & Arkansas
Lumber Co. v. Otts, 178 Ark. 283, 10 S.W.2d 364,
365; Southern Pac. Co. v. McCready, C.C.A.Cal.,
47 F.2d 673, 675. It has reference to dangers that
are normally and necessarily incident to the oc-
cupation, which are deemed to be assumed by
workmen of mature years, whether they are ac-
tually aware of them or not. Chesapeake & 0.
Ry. Co. v. Cochran, C.C.A.W.Va., 22 F.2d 22,
It is founded upon the knowledge of the servant either
actual dr constructive, as to the hazards to be encountered
and his consent to take the chance of danger. Schuppenies
v. Oregon Short Line R. Co., 38 Idaho, 672, 225 P. 501, 505.
But it does not include the risks from the negligence of
the master, or the gross negligence of his superior servant.
Burton Const. Co. v. Metcalfe, 162 Ky. 366, 172 S.W. 698,
702; "Contributory negligence" is not synonymous with
assumption of risk. Dolese Bros. Co. v. Kahl, C.C.A.Iowa,
203 F. 627, 630. "Assumed risk" is founded upon the
knowledge of the employee, either actual or constructive,
of the risks to be encountered, and his consent to take the
chance of injury therefrom. Contributory negligence
implies misconduct, the doing of an imprudent act by the
Injured party, or his dereliction in failing to take proper
precaution for his personal safety. The doctrine of
assumed risk is founded upon contract, while contributory
negligence is solely matter of conduct. Wheeler v. Tyler,
129 Minn. 206, 152 N.W. 137.

## ASSUMPTION OF SKILL

The doctrine known
as the "assumption of skill" on the part of the
master sometimes makes the knowledge implied
against the master relative to the safety of the
place of work, and the nature, constituents, and
general characteristics of the things used in the
business, superior to that implied against the
servant, especially where the servant is inex-
perienced. Hines v. Little, 26 Ga.App. 136, 105 S.
E. 618.

## ASSURANCE

A pledge, guaranty, or surety. Na-
Misc. 453. A declaration tending to inspire full
confidence. Texas & N. 0. Ry. Co. v. New, Tex.
Civ.App., 95 S.W.2d 170, 175. A making secure;
insurance.
The term was formerly of very frequent use in the
modern sense of insurance, particularly in English mari-
time law, and still appears in the policies of some com-
panies, but is otherwise seldom seen of late years. There
seems to be a tendency, however, to use assurance for the
contracts of life insurance companies, and insurance for
risks upon property.
In conveyancing. A deed or instrument of con-
veyance. The legal evidences of the transfer of
property are in England called the "common as-
surances" of the kingdom, whereby every man's
estate is assured to him, and all controversies,
doubts, and difficulties are either prevented or
removed. 2 Bl.Comm. 294. State v. Farrand, 8
N.J.Law, 335.

## ASSURANCE, FURTHER, COVENANT FOR

See
Covenant for Further Assurance.

## ASSURE

To make certain and put beyond doubt.
Armour & Co. v. New York, N. H. & H. R. Co., 41
R.I. 361, 103 A. 1031, 1033. To declare solemnly;
to assure to any one with design of inspiring be-
lief or confidence; to declare, aver, avouch, assert,
or asseverate. Chanin v. Chevrolet Motor Co.,
C.C.A.Ill., 89 F.2d 889, 891. Used interchangeably
With insure in insurance law; in real property
documents it means a warranty; and in business
documents, generally, it means a pledge or se-
curity. Utilities Engineering Institute v. Kafad,
58 N.Y.S.2d 743, 745, 185 Misc. 1035.

## ASSURED

A person who has been insured by
some insurance company, or underwriter, against
losses or perils mentioned in the policy of insur-
ance. Brockway v. Insurance Co., C.C.Pa., 29 Fed.
Thus where a wife insures her husband's life for her
own benefit and he has no interest in the policy, she is
the "assured" and he the "insured."
The person for whose benefit the policy is is-
sued and to whom the loss is payable, not neces-
sarily the person on whose life or property the
policy is written. Insurance Co. v. Luchs, 2 S.Ct.
949, 108 U.S. 498, 27 L.Ed. 800. Ordinarily syn-
onymous with insured. Thompson v. Northwest-
ern Mut. Life Ins. Co., 161 Iowa, 446, 143 N.W. 518.

## ASSURED CLEAR DISTANCE AHEAD

Re-
quires driver keep automobile under such control
that he can stop in distance that he can clearly
see, the distance varying with circumstances.

608, 610; Smiley v. Arrow Spring Bed Co., 138
Ohio St. 81, 33 N.E.2d 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 133 A.L.R. 960.

## ASYLUM

A sanctuary, or place of refuge and
protection, where criminals and debtors found
shelter, and from which they could not be taken
without sacrilege. Cromie v. Institution of Mercy,
3 Bush (Ky.) 391.
Shelter; refuge; protection from the hand of
justice. The word includes not only place, but
also shelter, security, protection.
A fugitive from justice, who has committed a crime in a
foreign country, "seeks an asylum" at all times when he
claims the use of the territories of the United States. In
re De Giacomo, 12 Blatchf. 395, Fed.Cas.No.3,747. Every
sovereign state has the right to offer an asylum to fugitives
from other countries, but there is no corresponding right
on the part of the alien to claim asylum. In recent years
this right of asylum has been voluntarily limited by most
states by treaties providing for the extradition (q. v.) of
fugitive criminals.
In time of war, a place of refuge in neutral
territory for belligerent war-ships.
An institution for the protection and relief of
unfortunates, as asylums for the poor, for the
deaf and dumb, or for the insane. Lawrence v.
Leidigh, 58 Kan. 594, 50 P. 600, 62 Am.St.Rep.
631. The term may also include a hospital con-
structed and maintained by the United States
government for the treatment of soldiers and ex-
soldiers. Kemp v. Heebner, 77 Colo. 177, 234 P.
1068, 1069.
ing, and somewhat indefinite. As used to fix a
time, it does not necessarily mean eo instante or
the identical time named, or even a fixed definite
moment. Barnett v. Strain, 151 Ga. 553, 107 S.E.
530, 532; In re Clark's Estate, 61 P.2d 1221, 1222,
17 Cal.App.2d 323; And may mean on the same
day, Perry v. Gross, 172 Cal. 468, 156 P. 1031,
1032. But "at" may often express simply near-
ness and proximity, and consequently may denote
a reasonable time. Smeltzer v. Atlanta Coach Co.,
44 Ga.App. 53, 160 S.E. 665, 666. Primarily, "at"
means "near" or "near to," and involves the idea
of proximity. Chesapeake & 0. Ry. Co. v. Hill,
215 Ky. 222, 284 S.W. 1047, 1048, 48 A.L.R. 327;
"At" a village or city may mean "near." Howell
v. State, 164 Ga. 204, 138 S.E. 206, 209; Board of
Trustees of Albany College v. Monteith, 64 Or.
356, 130 P. 633, 636. Depending on the context,
"at" may be equivalent to "in"; Millikan v. Se-
curity Trust Co., 187 Ind. 307, 118 N.E. 568; Fayette
County Board of Education v. Tompkins, 212 Ky.
751, 280 S.W. 114, 116; "toward"; State v. Cun-
ningham, 107 Miss. 140, 65 So. 115, 117, 51 L.R.A.
(N.S.) 1179; "after"; Davis v. Godart, 131 Minn.
221, 154 N.W. 1091, 1092; "not later than"; Smith
v. Jacksonville Oil Mill Co., 21 Ga.App. 679, 94
S.E. 900, 901; or be equivalent to the words on,
by, about, under, over, through, from, to, etc.

## AT ARM'S LENGTH

Beyond the reach of per-
sonal influence or control.
Parties are said to deal "at arm's length" when each
stands upon the strict letter of his rights, and conducts
the business in a formal manner, without trusting to the
other's fairness or integrity, and without being subject to
the other's control or overmastering influence.

## AT BAR

Before the court. "The case at bar,"
etc. Dyer, 31.

## AT ISSUE

Whenever the parties come to a point
in the pleadings which is affirmed on one side and
denied on the other, they are said to be at an

AT LARGE. Not limited to any particular place,
district, person, matter, or question; open to dis-
cussion or controversy; not precluded. Free;

liable to do mischief. Fully; in detail; in an ex-
tended form.

electors of an entire state.

## AT LAW

particularly in distinction from that which is done
in or according to equity; or in titles such as
sergeant at law, barrister at law, attorney or
counsellor at law. Hooker v. Nichols, 116 N.C.
157, 21 S.E. 208.

## AT LEAST

In deed of trust covenant specifying
amount of fire insurance, means at lowest esti-
mate, at smallest concession or claim, in smallest
or lowest degree, at smallest number. Browne v.
Franklin Fire Ins. Co., 225 Mo.App. 665, 37 S.W.2d
977, 979.
phrase is construed as synonymous with "imme-
diately" and "forthwith," where the subject-mat-
ter is the giving of notice. The use of such term
does not ordinarily call for instantaneous action,
but rather that notice shall be given within such
time as is reasonable in view of the circumstances.
George v. Aetna Casualty and Surety Co., 121
Neb. 647, 238 N.W. 36, 39. Likewise, contracts or
statutes requiring the performance of a particular
act "at once" are usually held to mean simply
within a reasonable time. Arizona Power Co. v.
State, 19 Ariz. 114, 166 P. 275, 277. An order to
"ship at once" is synonymous with "as soon as
possible". Myers v. Hardin, 208 Ark. 505, 186 S.

611, 44 N.E.2d 967, 970, 144 A.L.R. 887.

It differs from arrest, because it takes not only the body,
but sometimes the goods, whereas an arrest is only against
the person; besides, he who attaches keeps the party
attached in order to produce him in court on the day
named, but he who arrests lodges the person arrested in
the custody of a higher power, to be forthwith disposed of.

side of the affidavit, is improper. Wood v. Yearous, 159
Iowa, 211, 140 N.W. 362, 364.

## ATTACHMENT

The act or process of taking,
apprehending, or seizing persons or property, by
virtue of a writ, summons, or other judicial order,
and bringing the same into the custody of the
law; used either for the purpose of bringing a
person before the court, of acquiring jurisdiction
over the property seized, to compel an appearance,
to furnish security for debt or costs, or to arrest
a fund in the hands of a third person who may be-
come liable to pay it over. Also the writ or other
process for the accomplishment of the purposes
above enumerated, this being the more common
use of the word. A remedy ancillary to an action
by which plaintiff is enabled to acquire a lien
upon property or effects of defendant for satis-
faction of judgment which plaintiff may obtain.
First Nat. Bank & Trust Co. of Vermillion v.
Kirby, 62 S.D. 489, 253 N.W. 616; Lipscomb v.
Rankin, Tex.Civ.App., 139 S.W.2d 367, 369. Though
sometimes called an ancillary or auxiliary pro-
ceeding, it is in all essential respects, a suit.
Farmers State Bank of Lexington v. Lemmer, 130
Neb. 211, 264 N.W. 415, 416.
The purpose is to take defendant's property into legal
custody, so that it may be applied on defendant's debt to
plaintiff when established. John Deere Plow Co. of St.
Louis v. L. D. Jennings, Inc., 203 S.C. 426, 27 S.E.2d 571,
572; Union Bank & Trust Co. v. Edwards, 281 Ky. 693, 137
23.W.2d 344, 348.
At common law, "attachment" was procedure whereby
sheriff was, commanded to attach a defendant who, after
mons, by keeping certain of his goods which he would for-
feit if he did not appear, or by making him find securities
who would be amerced if he continued his nonappearance,
and, if after such attachment he still neglected to appear,
he would not only forfeit this security, but was compel-
lable by a writ of distringas infinite. Grimmett v. Barn-
well, 184 Ga. 461, 192 S.E. 191, 194, 116 A.L.R. 257.
Execution and attachment distinguished. See
Execution.
Persons
A writ issued by a court of record, commanding
the sheriff to bring before it a person who has
been guilty of contempt of court, either in neglect
or abuse of its process or of subordinate powers.
3 Bl.Comm. 280; 4 Bl.Comm. 283; Commonwealth
v. Shecter, 250 Pa. 282, 95 A. 468, 470.
Property
A species of mesne process, by which a writ is
issued at the institution or during the progress
of an action, commanding the sheriff to seize the
property, rights, credits, or effects of the defend-
ant to be held as security for the satisfaction of
such judgment as the plaintiff may recover. It is
principally used against absconding, concealed, or
fraudulent debtors. U. S. Capsule Co. v. Isaacs,
23 Ind.App. 533, 55 N.E. 832.
To Give Jurisdiction
Where the defendant is a non-resident, or be-
yond the territorial jurisdiction of the court, his
goods or land within the territory may be seized
upon process of attachment; whereby he will be
compelled to enter an appearance, or the court
acquires jurisdiction so far as to dispose of the
property attached. This is sometimes called "for-
eign attachment." Megee v. Beirne, 39 Pa. 50;
Bray v. McClury, 55 Mo. 128. In such a case, the
proceeding becomes in substance one in rem
against the attached property. St. John v. Par-
sons, 54 Ohio App. 420, 7 N.E.2d 1013, 1014.
Domestic and Foreign
In some jurisdictions it is common to give the
name "domestic attachment" to one issuing
against a resident debtor, (upon the special
ground of fraud, intention to abscond, etc.,) and
to designate an attachment against a non-resident,
or his property, as "foreign." Longwell v. Hart-
well, 30 A. 495, 164 Pa. 533; David E. Kennedy,
Inc. v. Schleindl, 290 Pa. 38, 137 A. 815, 816, 53
A.L.R. 1020.
But the term "foreign attachment" more properly
belongs to the process otherwise familiarly known as
"garnishment." It was a peculiar and ancient remedy
open to creditors within the jurisdiction of the city of
London, by which they were enabled to satisfy their own
debts by attaching or seizing the money or goods of the
debtor in the hands of a third person within the jurisdic-
tion of the city. Welsh v. Blackwell, 14 N.J.Law, 346.
This power and process survive in modern law, in all com-
mon-law jurisdictions, and are variously denominated.
"garnishment," "trustee process," or "factorizing." Rai-
guel v. McConnell, 25 Pa. 362, 363. A "foreign attachment"
is a mesne process issued to compel a foreign debtor to
appear to the suit of his creditor, while "attachment
execution" is a final process issued for the purpose of
enforcing a judgment already obtained. Williams v. Ricca,
324 Pa. 33, 187 A. 722, 723.
satisfaction of a judgment. As to the judgment
debtor it is an execution; but as to the garnishee
it is an original process—a summons commanding
him to appear and show cause, if any he has, why
the judgment should not be levied on the goods
and effects of the defendant in his hands. Snider-
man v. Nerone, 7 A.2d 496, 499, 136 Pa.Super. 381.

## ATTACHMENT OF PRIVILEGE

In English law.
A process by which a man, by virtue of his privi-
lege, calls another to litigate in that court to
which he himself belongs, and who has the privi-
lege to answer there. A writ issued to apprehend
a person in a privileged place. Termes de la Ley.

## ATTACHMENT OF THE FOREST

One of the
three courts formerly held in forests. The high-
est court was called "justice in eyre's seat;" the
middle, the "swainmote;" and the lowest, the "at-
tachment." Manwood, 90, 99.

## ATTAIN

To reach or come to by progression or
motion; to arrive at; as, to attain a ripe old age.
Watkins v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 156 Kan.
27, 131 P.2d 722, 723.

## ATTAINDER

That extinction of civil rights and
capacities which takes place whenever a person
who has committed treason or felony receives
sentence of death for his crime. 1 Steph.Com. 408;
1 Bish.Cr.L. § 641; State v. Hastings, 37 Neb. 96,
55 N.W. 781.
The effect of "attainder" upon such felon is, in general
terms, that all his estate, real and personal, is forfeited.
Caldwell v. Hill, 179 Ga. 417, 176 S.E. 381, 386, 98 A.L.R.
1124. It differs from conviction, in that it is after judg-
ment, whereas conviction is upon the verdict of guilty, but
before judgment pronounced, and may be quashed upon
some point of law reserved, or judgment may be arrested.
The consequences of attainder are forfeiture of property
and corruption of blood. 4 Bl.Comm. 380. At the common
law, attainder resulted in three ways, viz. : by confession,
by verdict, and by process or outlawry. The first case was
where the prisoner pleaded guilty at the bar, or having
fled to sanctuary, confessed his guilt and abjured the realm
to save his life. The second was where the prisoner
pleaded not guilty at the bar, and the jury brought in a
verdict against him. The third, when the person accused
made his escape and was outlawed. Coke, Litt. 391.
In England, by statute 33 & 34 Vict. c. 23, attainder upon
conviction, with consequent corruption of blood, forfeiture,
or escheat, is abolished. In the United States, the doctrine
of attainder is now, scarcely known, although during and
shortly after the Revolution acts of attainder were passed
by several of the states. The passage of such bills is
expressly forbidden by the constitution.
Bill of Attainder
A legislative act, directed against a designated
person, pronouncing him guilty of an alleged
crime, (usually treason,) without trial or convic-
tion according to the recognized rules of proce-
dure, and passing sentence of death and attainder
upon him.
"Bills of attainder," as they are technically called, are
such special acts of the legislature as inflict capital punish-
ments upon persons supposed to be guilty of high offenses,
such as treason and felony, without any conviction in the
ordinary course of judicial proceedings. If an act inflicts
a milder degree of punishment than death, it is called a
"bill of pains and penalties," but both are included in the
Mo. 1102, 182 S.W.2d 46, 54.

## ATTAINT

Attainted, stained, or blackened.
In old English practice. A writ which lay to
inquire whether a jury of twelve men had given
a false verdict, in order that the judgment might
be reversed. 3 Bl.Comm. 402; Bract. fol. 288b-
292; Fleta, 1, 5, c. 22, § 8.
This inquiry was made by a grand assise or jury of
twenty-four persons, usually knights, and, if they found
the verdict a false one, the judgment was that the jurors
should become infamous, should forfeit their goods and
the profits of their lands, should themselves be imprisoned,
and their wives and children thrust out of doors, should
have their houses razed, their trees extirpated, and their
meadows plowed up, and that the plaintiff should be
restored to all that he lost by reason of the unjust verdict.
3 Bl.Comm. 404; Co.Litt. 294b.
ATTAINT D'UNE CAUSE, In French law. The
gain of a suit.
ATTEMPT.
In Civil Matters
In statutes and in cases other than criminal
prosecutions an "attempt" ordinarily means an
intent combined with an act falling short of the
thing intended. In re Bergland's Estate, 180 Cal.
629, 182 P. 277, 283, 5 A.L.R. 1363. It may be de-
scribed as an endeavor to do an act, carried be-
yond mere preparation, but short of execution.
Columbian Ins. Co. of Indiana v. Modern Laundry,
C.C.A.Minn., 277 F. 355, 358, 20 A.L.R. 1159.
In Criminal Law
An effort or endeavor to accomplish a crime,
amounting to more than mere preparation or
planning for it, which, if not prevented, would
have resulted in the full consummation of the
act attempted, but which, in fact, does not bring
to pass the party's ultimate design. Dooley v.
State, 27 Ala.App. 261, 170 So. 96, 98.
Acts amounting to mere preparation for commission of
crime, if unaccompanied by some overt act toward actual
commission, do not amount to an "attempt" and cannot be
punished as such. People v. Lombard, 131 Cal.App. 525, 21
P.2d 955. Implies an intent and an actual effort to carry
out or consummate the intent or purpose. Dooley v. State,
27 Ala.App. 261, 170 So. 96, 97, 98.
To constitute an act of attempt, the act must possess
four characteristics : First, it must be a step toward a
punishable offense ; second, it must be apparently (but not
necessarily in reality) adapted to the purpose intended;
third, it must come dangerously near to success; fourth,
it must not succeed. State v. Ainsworth, 146 Kan. 665, 72
P.2d 962.

## ATTENDANT

One who owes a duty or service
to another, or in some sort depends upon him.
Termes de la Ley. One who follows and waits
upon another.
ATTENDANT, adj. Accompanying, or connected
with. Fletcher v. Winnfield Bottling Works, 160
La. 261, 107 So. 103, 104.

## ATTENDANT TERMS

In English law, terms,
(usually mortgages,) for a long period of years,
which are created or kept outstanding for the
attending
ing the inheritance. 1 Steph.Comm. 351.
A phrase used in conveyancing to denote estates which
are kept alive, after the objects for which they were orig-
inally created have ceased, so that they might be deemed
merged or satisfied, for the purpose of protecting or
strengthening the title of the owner. Abbott.

## ATTENDED BY A PHYSICIAN

As used in ap-
plication for insurance, requires an attendance
with reference to some disease of a serious charac-
ter, affecting sound bodily health and does not
refer to a mere temporary indisposition or an ail-
ment trivial in its nature. Houston v. Metropoli-
tan Life Ins. Co., 232 Mo.App. 195, 97 S.W.2d 856,
ATTENTAT. Lat. He attempts.
In the civil and canon law. Anything wrong-
fully innovated or attempted in a suit by an in-
ferior judge (or judge a quo) pending an appeal.
1 Addams, 22, note; Shelf.Mar. & Div. 562; Ay-
liffe, Parerg. 100.

## ATTENTION

Consideration; notice. The phrase
"your bill shall have attention" was held to be
ambiguous and not to amount to an acceptance of
the bill. 2 B. & Aid. 113.

## ATTERMINARE

In old English law. To put
off to a succeeding term; to prolong the time of
payment of a debt. Stat.Westm. 2, c. 4; Cowell;
Blount.

off; the granting of a time or term, as for the
payment of a debt. Cowell.

## ATTEST

To bear witness to; to bear witness
to a fact; to affirm to be true or genuine; to act
as a witness to; to certify; to certify to the veri-
ty of a copy of a public document; formally by
signature; to make solemn declaration in words
or writing to support a fact; to signify by sub-
scription of his name that the signer has witnessed
the execution of the particular instrument. Lind-
sey v. Realty Trust Co., Tex.Civ.App., 75 S.W.2d
322, 324; City Lumber Co. of Bridgeport v. Borsuk,
131 Conn. 640, 41 A.2d 775, 778.
Also the technical word by which, in the practice in
many of the states, a certifying officer gives assurance of
the genuineness and correctness of a copy. Thus, an
"attested" copy of a document is one which has been
examined and compared with the original, with a certifi-
cate or memorandum of its correctness, signed by the per-
sons who have examined it. Gerner v. Mosher, 58 Neb.
135, 78 N.W. 384, 46 L.R.A. 244.

## ATTESTATION

The act of witnessing an instru-
ment in writing, at the request of the party mak-
ing the same, and subscribing it as a witness. In
re Jones' Estate, 101 Wash. 128, 172 P. 206, 207.
The act of witnessing the execution of a paper
and subscribing the name of the witness in testi-
mony of such fact. In re Carlson's Estate, 156
Or. 597, 68 P.2d 119, 121.
the former being the act of the party, the latter of the
witnesses only. Subscription differs from attestation, in
that the former is the mere manual or mechanical act of
signing—the act of the hand, whereas the latter signifies
the mental act of bearing witness to—the act of the senses.
In re Smith's Estate, 130 Neb. 739, 266 N.W. 611, 613.

## ATTESTATION CLAUSE

That clause wherein
the witnesses certify that the instrument has been
executed before them, and the manner of the exe-
cution of the same.
In wills. A certificate certifying as to facts and
circumstances attending execution of will. In
re Bragg's Estate, 106 Mont. 132, 76 P.2d 57, 62.

## ATTESTATION OF WILL

Act of witnessing
performance of statutory requirements to valid
execution. Davis v. Davis, Tex.Civ.App., 45 S.W.
2d 240, 241; Zaruba v. Schumaker, Tex.Civ.App.,
178 S.W.2d 542, 543.
There is some authority to the effect that there may be a
perfect attestation without subscription, on the theory that
attestation is mental, and subscription is mechanical. In
re Chambers' Estate, 187 Wash. 417, 60 P.2d 41, 44.

## ATTESTED COPY

See Attest.

## ATTESTING WITNESS

One who signs his name
to an instrument, at the request of the party or
parties, for the purpose of proving and identifying

## ATTINCTA, L

Lat. An attaint, stain, or black-
ening; a conviction or finding of guilty of some
offense. Adams Gloss.

Misc. 163, 189 A. 363, 364. To consent to the trans-
fer of a rent or reversion. To agree to become
tenant to one as owner or landlord of an estate
previously held of another, or to agree to recog-
nize a new owner of a property or estate and

Feudal Law
To turn over; to transfer to another money or
goods; to assign to some particular use or serv-
ice. 2 Bla.Comm. 288; 1 Spence, Eq.Jur. 137.

consent of the tenant, and in some cases without, attorn
or transfer the homage and service of the latter to the
alienee or new lord. Bract. fols. 81b, 82.
ATTORNARE, Lat. To attorn; to transfer or
turn over; to appoint an attorney or substitute.
goods, i. e., to assign or appropriate them to some
particular use or service.
ATTORNATO FACIENDO VEL RECIPIENDO.

sents the person of his master in almost all re-
spects. Adams Gloss., citing Bract. fol. 342.

## ATTORNE

L. Fr. In old English law. An at-
torney. Britt. c. 126.

## ATTORNEY

In the most general sense this
term denotes an agent or substitute, or one who is
appointed and authorized to act in the place or
stead of another. Nardi v. Poinsatte, D.C.Ind.,
46 F.2d 347, 348. An agent, or one acting on be-
half of another. Sherts v. Fulton Nat. Bank of
Lancaster, 342 Pa. 337, 21 A.2d 18.
One who s put in place, stead, and turn of an-
other to ma lage his matters of law. Kaufman v.
Jurczak, 102 N.J.Eq. 66, 139 A. 716. An agent
employed by party to case to manage it for him.
McLyman v. Miller, 52 R.I. 374, 161 A. 111, 112.
When used with reference to the proceedings of courts,
or the transaction of business in the courts, the term
always means "attorney at law" (q. v.) unless a contrary
meaning is clearly indicated. In re Morse, 98 Vt. 85, 126
A. 550, 551, 36 A.L.R. 527.
"Lawyer" and "attorney" are synonymous. Peo-
ple v. Taylor, 56 Colo. 441, 138 P. 762, 763.
—Attorney ad hoc. See Ad Hoc.
—Attorney at large. In old practice. An attorney
who practiced in all the courts. Cowell.
—Attorney at law. An advocate, counsel, or offi-
cial agent employed in preparing, managing, and
trying cases in the courts. An officer in a court

to manage it for him. In re Bergeron, 220 Mass.
472, 107 N.E. 1007, 1008, Ann.Cas.1917A, 549.
In English law. A public officer belonging to the supe-
rior courts of common law at Westminster, who conducted
legal proceedings on behalf of others, called his clients,
by whom he was retained; he answered to the solicitor in
the courts of chancery, and the proctor of the admiralty,
ecclesiastical, Probate, and divorce courts. An attorney
was almost invariably also a solicitor. It is now provided
by the judicature act, 1873, § 87, that solicitors, attorneys,
Dr proctors of, or by law empowered to practice in, any
court the jurisdiction of which is by that act transferred
to the high court of justice or the court of appeal, shall
be called "so .citors of the supreme court." Wharton.
The term 'attorney at law," as used in the United
States, usua ly includes "barrister," "counsellor," and
"solicitor," in the sense in which those terms are used in
England. In some states, as well as in the United States
supreme court, "attorney" and "counsellor" are distin-
guishable, the former term being applied to the younger
members of the bar, and to those who carry on the prac-
adviser, or special counsel retained to try the cause. Rap.
& L.
—Attorney in fact. A private attorney authorized
by another to act in his place and stead, either for
some particular purpose, as to do a particular act,
or for the transaction of business in general, not
of a legal character. This authority is conferred
by an instrument in writing, called a "letter of at-
torney," or more commonly a "power of at-
torney." Treat v. Tolman, C.C.A.N.Y., 113 F.
893, 51 C.C.A. 522; Massachusetts Bonding & In-
surance Co. v. Bankers' Surety Co., 96 Ind.App.
250, 179 N.E. 329, 334.
This term is employed to designate persons who act
under a special agency, or a special letter of attorney, so
that they are appointed in fact-um, for the deed, or special
act to be performed; but in a more extended sense it
includes all other agents employed in any business, or to do
any act or acts in pais for another. Bacon, Abr. Attor-
ney; Story, Ag. § 25.
—Attorney of record. Attorney whose name must
appear somewhere in permanent records or files
of case, or on the pleadings or some instrument
filed in the case, or on appearance docket. De-
laney v. Husband, 64 N.J.L. 275, 45 A. 265. Per-
son whom the client has named as his agent
upon whom service of papers may be made.
Reynolds v. Reynolds, 21 Ca1.2d 580, 134 P.2d 251,

30. See also 7 & 8 Vict. c. 73, §§ 21-26; 16 & 17
Vict. c. 63.
—Attorney's lien. See Attorney's Lien.
—Letter of attorney. A power of attorney; a
written instrument by which one person consti-
tutes another his true and lawful attorney, in or-
der that the latter may do for the former, and in
his place and stead, some lawful act. People v.
Smith, 112 Mich. 192, 70 N.W. 466, 67 Am.St.Rep.
392. An instrument of writing, appointing an at-
torney in fact for an avowed purpose and setting
forth his powers and duties. Mullins v. Common-
wealth, 179 Ky. 71, 200 S.W. 9, 11. It is, in effect,
a mere contract of agency. Filtsch v. Bishop, 118
Okl. 272, 247 P. 1110, 1111. A general power au-
thorizes the agent to act generally in behalf of
the principal. A special power is one limited to
particular acts.
—Power of attorney. Commonly meant the in-
strument by which authority of one person to act
in place and stead of another as attorney in fact
is set forth. In re Katz' Estate, 274 N.Y.S. 202,
152 Misc. 757.
—Public attorney. A name sometimes given to an
attorney at law, as distinguished from a private
attorney, or attorney in fact.

mations and prosecute for the crown in matters
criminal, and to file bills in the exchequer in any
matter concerning the king's revenue. 3 Bla.
Comm. 27; Termes de la Ley; Wilentz v. Hen-
drickson, 133 N.J.Eq. 447, 33 A.2d 366, 374.
American Law
The attorney general of the United States is the
head of the department of justice, appointed by
the president, and a member of the cabinet. He
appears in behalf of the government in all cases
in the supreme court in which the government
is interested, and gives his legal advice to the
president and heads of departments upon ques-
tions submitted to him. Act of Sept. 24, 1789 (5
U.S.C.A. §§ 291, 303, 309).
He is the chief law officer of the federal and state gov-
ernments with the duty of representing the sovereign,
national or state. Johnson v. Commonwealth, ex rel.
Meredith, 291 Ky. 829, 165 S.W.2d 820, 826.
In each state also there is an attorney general,
or similar officer, who appears for the people, as
in England the attorney general appears for the
crown. State v. District Court, 22 Mont. 25, 55
Pac. 916; He is the chief law officer of the state
and head of the legal department. People v.
Newcomer, 284 Ill. 315, 120 N.E. 244, 247; Darling

## ATTORNEY'S LIEN

The right of an attorney at
law to hold or retain in his possession the money
or property of a client until his proper charges
have been adjusted and paid. It requires no eq-
uitable proceeding for its establishment. Sweeley
v. Sieman, 123 Iowa, 183, 98 N.W. 571. Also a
lien on funds in court payable to the client, or on
a judgment or decree or award in his favor, re-
covered through the exertions of the attorney, and
for the enforcement of which he must invoke the
equitable aid of the court. Fowler v. Lewis, 36 W.
Va. 112, 14 S.E. 447.
Charging lien. An attorney's lien, for his proper compen-
sation, on the fund or judgment which his client has recov-
ered by means of his professional aid and services. Good-
rich v. McDonald, 112 N.Y. 157, 19 N.E. 649; In re Craig,
157 N.Y.S. 310, 311, 171 App.Div. 218. It is a specific
lien covering only the services rendered by an attorney in
the action in which the judgment was obtained, whereas
a retaining lien is a general lien for the balance of the
account between the attorney and his client, and applies
to the property of the client which may come into the
attorney's possession in the course of his employment. In
re Heinsheimer, 143 N.Y.S. 895, 896, 159 App.Div. 33.

his client's papers, deeds, vouchers, etc., which remain in

tion of his claims for professional services. In re Wilson,

leum Co. v. Rice, 109 Okl. 161, 235 P. 502, 507.

## ATTORNMENT

In feudal and old English law.
A turning over or transfer by a lord of the serv-
ices of his tenant to the grantee of his seigniory.
Attornment is the act of a person who holds a
leasehold interest in land, or estate for life or
years, by which he agrees to become the tenant
of a stranger who has acquired the fee in the land,
or the remainder or reversion, or the right to the
rent or services by which the tenant holds. Sny-
der v. Bernstein Bros., 201 Iowa, 931, 208 N.W. 503,
504. It is an act by which a tenant acknowledges
his obligation to a new landlord. Del-New Co. v.
James, 167 A. 747, 748, 111 N.J.L. 157.
And requires an overt act by the tenant. Hem-
minger v. Klaprath, 189 A. 363, 15 N.J.Misc. 163.
The doctrine of attornment grew out of the peculiar
relations existing between the landlord and his tenant
under the feudal law, and the reasons for the rule never
had any existence in this country, and is inconsistent with
our laws, customs and institutions. Beyond its application
to estop a tenant from denying the title of his landlord, it
can serve but little, if any, useful purpose. Perrin v. Lep-
per, 34 Mich. 292.

## ATTRACTIVE AGENCIES DOCTRINE

See At-
tractive Nuisance Doctrine. Schock v. Ringling
Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Combined Shows,
5 Wash. 599, 105 P.2d 838, 843.

## ATTRACTIVE INSTRUMENTALITIES DOC- TRINE

See Attractive Nuisance Doctrine.
Schock v. Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey
Combined Shows, 5 Wash.2d 599, 105 P.2d 838, 843.

## ATTRACTIVE NUISANCE DOCTRINE

The doc-
trine is that one maintaining on his premises a
condition, instrumentality, machine or other agen-
cy, which is dangerous to young children because
of their inability to appreciate peril and may rea-
sonably be expected to attract them to premises,
owes duty to exercise reasonable care to protect
them against dangers of such attraction. Schock
v. Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Combined
Shows, 5 Wash.2d 599, 105 P.2d 838, 843.
The doctrine, is that person who has an instrumentality,
agency, or condition upon his own premises, or who cre-
ates such condition on the premises of another, or in a
public place, which may reasonably be apprehended to be
a source of danger to children, is under a duty to take such
precautions as a reasonably prudent man would take to
prevent injury to children of tender years whom he knows
to be accustomed to resort there, or who may, by reason
of something there which may be expected to attract
them, come there to play. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v.
O'Neal, 48 Ga.App. 706, 172 S.E. 740, 741. It does not
apply to natural condition or common dangers existing in
order of nature, McCall v. McCallie, 48 Ga.App. 99, 171 S.E.
843, 844, applies only in favor of children of tender years,
too young to appreciate danger. Drew v. Lett, 95 Ind. App.
89, 182 N.E. 547, 548. Requires that the attraction be visi-
ble from a public place or a place where children have a
right to be. Rokicki v. Polish Nat. Alliance of United
States of North America, 314 Ill.App. 380, 41 N.E.2d 300.

## AU BESOIN

Fr. In case of need. "Au besoin
chez Messieurs a ." "In case of need, ap-
ply to Messrs. at ". A phrase some-
times used in the direction of a bill of exchange,
pointing out the person to whom application may

of the drawee to pay. Story, Bills § 65.

## AUCTION

A public sale of land or goods, at
public outcry, to the highest bidder. Perry Trad-
ing Co. v. City of Tallahassee, 128 Fla. 424, 174
So. 854, 857, 111 A.L.R. 463.
A sale by auction is a, sale by public outcry to the
highest bidder on the spot. Barber Lumber Co. v. Gifford,
25 Idaho, 654, 139 P. 557, 560.
While auction is very generally defined as a sale to the
highest bidder, and this is the usual meaning, there may
be a sale to the lowest bidder, as where land is sold for
non-payment of taxes to whomsoever will take it for the
shortest term; or where a contract is offered to the one
who will perform it at the lowest price. And these appear
fairly included In the term "auction." Abbott.
Dutch Auction
A method of sale by auction which consists in
the public offer of the property at a price beyond
its value, and then gradually lowering the price
until some one becomes the purchaser. Crandall
v. State, 28 Ohio St. 482.
Public Auction
A sale of property at auction, where any and
all persons who choose are permitted to attend
and offer bids. The phrase imports a sale to the
highest and best bidder with absolute freedom for
competitive bidding. State v. Miller, 52 Mont.
562, 160 P. 513, 515.
Though this phrase is frequently used, It is doubtful
whether the word "public" adds anything to the force of
the expression, since4"auction" itself imports publicity. If
there can be such a thing as a private auction, it must be
one where the property is sold to the highest bidder, but
only certain persons, or a certain class of persons, are
permitted to be present or to offer bids.
AUCTIONARLzE. Catalogues of goods for public
sale or auction.

## AUCTIONARIUS

A.L.R. 489; One who sells goods at public auction
for another on commission, or for a recompense.
State ex rel. Danziger v. Recorder of Mortgages
for Parish of Orleans, 206 La. 259, 19 So.2d 129,
Auctioneers differ from brokers, in that the latter may
both buy and sell, whereas auctioneers can only sell; also
brokers may sell by private contract only, and auctioneers
by public auction only. Auctioneers can only sell goods
for ready money, but factors may sell upon credit. Wilkes
v. Ellis, 2 H. BI. 557; Steward v. Winters, 4 Sandf.Ch.
(N. Y.) 590.

ducting a vessel from one place to another, tow-
age, light money, beaconage, anchorage, bridge

A pleading in the action of replevin,
by which the defendant avows, that is, acknowl-
edges, the taking of the distress or property
complained of, where he took it in his own right,
and sets forth the reason of it; as for rent in ar-
rear, damage done, etc. 3 Bl.Comm. 149; 1 Tidd
Pr. 645. L. A. W. Acceptance Corporation v. Cher-

Avowry is the setting forth, as in a declaration, the
nature and merits of the defendant's case, showing that
the distress taken by him was lawful, which must be done
with such sufficient authority as will entitle him to a
retorno habendo. Wilhem v. Boyd, 172 Md. 79, 190 A. 823,
An avowry must be distinguished from a justification.
The former species of plea admits the plaintiff's owner-
ship of the property, but alleges a right in the defendant
sufficient to warrant him in taking the property and which
still subsists. A justification, on the other hand, denies
that the plaintiff had the right of property or possession in
the subject-matter, alleging it to have been in the defend-
ant or a third person, or avers a right sufficient to warrant
the defendant in taking it, although such right has not
continued in force to the time of making answer. See 2
W.Jones, 25.

tion of a new one. Harper v. Holston, 119 Wash. 436, 205
P. 1062, 1064.
Where running streams are the boundaries between
states, the same rule applies as between private proprie-
tors, and, if the stream from any cause, natural or arti-
ficial, suddenly leaves its old bed and forms a new one by
the process known as "avulsion," the resulting change of
channel works no change of boundary, which remains in
the middle of the old channel though no water may be
