property. This stipulation, sometimes found in
mortgages made in Louisiana, and derived from
the Spanish law, binds the mortgagor not to sell

made to a third person, but enables the mortgagee

force, but which it recognizes only as a valid
ground of defense, were called "pacta." Those
agreements that are enforced, in other words, are
supported by actions, are called "contractus." The
exceptions are few, and belong to a late period.
Hunter, Rom. Law, 546.
Nudum Pactum. A bare or naked pact or
agreement; a promise or undertaking made with-
out any consideration for it, and therefore not

il Law. An agreement by which a person appoint-
ed to his creditor a certain day, or a certain time,

## PAINTING

A likeness, image, or scene depicted
with paints. Cent. Dict. The term does not nec-

division is had on the particular question. By this
mutual agreement a vote is neutralized on each
side of the question, and the relative numbers on

due to him from his feudal subordinates through
an ascending scale of penalties culminating in the
absolution of the prince's subjects from the bonds
of allegiance, and in the disposition of the sover-
eign himself. The papal supremacy was over-

## PAR

In commercial law. Equal; equality. An
equality subsisting between the nominal or face

inal worth, it is "above par;" if for less, it is "be-
low par." Conover v. Smith, 83 Cal.App. 227, 256

this footing; i. e., when a bill for £100 drawn on
London sells in Paris for 2,520 frs., and vice versa.

In Pari Delicto.

## PARACIUM

The tenure between parceners, viz.,
that which the youngest owes to the eldest with-
out homage or service. Domesday.
PARAGE, or PARAGIUM. An equality of blood
or dignity, but more especially of land, in the par-
tition of an inheritance between co-heirs. Co. Litt.
166b. More properly, however, an equality of
condition among nobles, or persons holding by a
noble tenure. Thus, when a fief is divided among
brothers, the younger hold their part of the elder
by parage; e., without any homage or service.
Also the portion which a woman may obtain on
her marriage. Cowell.

## PARAGRAPH

A distinct part of a discourse or
writing, any section or subdivision of writing or
chapter which relates to particular point, whether
consisting of one or many sentences. Lehmann v.
Revell, 354 Ill. 262, 188 N.E. 531, 540.
An entire or integral statement of a cause of
action equivalent to a count at common law. Bail-
ey v. Mosher, 11 C.C.A. 304, 63 F. 488.
A part or section of a statute, pleading, affidavit,
etc., which contains one article, the sense of which
is complete. McClellan v. Hein, 56 Neb. 600, 77
N.W. 120; Hill v. Fairhaven & W. R. Co., 75 Conn.
177, 52 A. 725; Marine v. Packham, 3 C.C.A. 210,
52 F. 579. The term in an act of congress will be
construed to mean section whenever to do so ac-
cords with the legislative intent; Alfrey v. Col-
bert, 93 C.C.A. 517, 168 F. 231.

## PARALLEL

Extending in the same direction and
in all parts equidistant; having the same direction
or tendency. Postal Tel. C. Co. v. R. Co., 88 Va.
920, 14 S.E. 803.
In the specification of a patent the word has been con-
strued in its popular sense of going side by side and not
in its purely mathematical sense; 2 App.Cas. 423; and so
in Fratt v. Woodward, 32 Cal. 231, 91 Am.Dec. 573; Wil-
liams v. Jackson, 5 Johns. (N.Y.) 489; where it was held
that parallel lines were not necessarily straight lines. For
two lines of street railway to be "parallel," within the
lines should be parallel for the whole length of each or
either route. Exact parallelism is not contemplated. Cro-
nin v. Highland St. Ry. Co.. 144 Mass. 254, 10 N.E. 833.
And see East St. Louis Connecting Ry., Co. v. Jarvis, 34
C.C.A. 639, 92 F. 735; Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Kentucky,
16 S.Ct. 714, 161 U.S. 677, 40 L. Ed. 849.

## PARALYSIS

In its popular rather than medical
sense, signifies that the part of the body so af-
flicted, as an arm, is numb. Hudson v. Kansas
City Rys. Co., Mo.Sup., 246 S.W. 576, 578.

## PARAMOUNT

Above; upwards. Kelh. Norm.
Dict. Paramount especifió, above specified.
Plowd. 209a. Higher; superior; pre-eminent; of
the highest rank or nature. Board of Com'rs of
Big Horn County v. Bench Canal Drainage Dist.,
56 Wyo. 285, 108 P.2d 590, 594. Malone v. Kansas
City Rys. Co., Mo.App., 232 S.W. 782, 785. That
which is superior; usually applied to the highest
lord of the fee of lands, tenements, or heredita-
ments, as distinguished from the mesne (or inter-
mediate) lord. Fitzh. Nat. Brev. 135.

## PARAMOUNT EQUITY

An equitable right or
claim which is prior, superior, or preferable to
that with which it is compared.

## PARAMOUNT TITLE

In the law of real prop-
erty, properly one which is superior to the title
with which it is compared, in the sense that the
former is the source or origin of the latter. It is,
however, frequently used to denote a title which
is simply better or stronger than another, or will
prevail over it. Isaacs v. Maupin, 191 Ky. 527, 231
S.W. 49, 51. But this use is scarcely correct, un-
less the superiority consists in the seniority of
the title spoken of as "paramount." Hoopes v.
Meyer, 1 Nev. 444; Jones & Brindisi, Inc., v. Bern-
stein, 119 Misc.Rep. 697, 197 N.Y.S. 263, 265.

land, 126 La. 674, 52 So. 986-988.

## PARAPHERNA

In the civil law. Goods brought
by wife to husband over and above her dowry
(dos). Voc. Jur. Utr.; Fleta, lib. 5, c. 23, § 6;
Mack. C. L. § 529.
In mediaeval times the "res parapherna" were all the
goods other than the "dos." These the husband did not
own and of them the wife could make her will. 3 Holdsw.
Hist. E. L. 426.

## PARAPHERNAL PROPERTY

See Parapherna-
lia.

## PARAPHERNALIA

The separate property of a
married woman, other than that which is included
in her dowry, or dos.
The separate property of the wife is divided into dotal
and extradotal. Dotal property is that which the wife
brings to the husband to assist him in bearing the ex-
penses of the marriage establishment. Extradotal proper-
ty, otherwise called "paraphernal property," is that which
forms no part of the dowry. Civ. Code La. art. 2335. It
is property brought to the marriage by one of the spouses.
There can be no such thing as paraphernal property prior
to marriage; Le Boeuf v. Melancon, 131 La. 148, 59 So.
Those goods which a woman is allowed to have,
after the death of her husband, besides her dower,
consisting of her apparel and ornaments, suitable
to her rank and degree. 2 Bl. Comm. 436.
Those goods which a wife could bequeath by her
testament. 2 Poll. & Maitl. 427.

prefixed to titles of law, giving a summary of their
contents. Cod. 1, 17, 1, 12. An abbreviated explan-
ation of some titles or books of the Code or Digest.

## PARATUM HABEO

Lat. I have him in readi-
ness. The return by the sheriff to a capias ad
respondendum, signifying that he has the defend-
ant in readiness to be brought into court. This
was a fiction, where the defendant was at large.
Afterwards he was required, by statute, to take
bail from the defendant, and he returned cepi cor-
pus and bailbond. But still he might be ruled to
bring in the body; White v. Fitler, 7 Pa. 533.

## PARATUS EST VERIFICARE

Lat. He is ready
to verify. The Latin form for concluding a plead-
ing with a verification, (q. v.).

## PARAVAIL

Inferior; subordinate. Tenant par-
avail signified the lowest tenant of land, being the

value of one shilling, of the goods," etc. The parcel in
question was taken from the hold of a vessel, out of a box
broken open by the prisoner. Held an insufficient descrip-
tion; 7 Cox, C. C. 13.

Town of Churdan, 196 Iowa 1057, 195 N.W. 996,
997. A part of an estate. Martin v. Cole, 38 Iowa,
141; 1 Comyns, Dig. Abatement (H 51), Grant (E
10). It may be synonymous with lot. Terre Haute
v. Mack, 139 Ind. 99, 38 N.E. 468.

## PARDON

An act of grace, proceeding from the
power intrusted with the execution of the laws,
which exempts the individual on whom it is be-
stowed from the punishment the law inflicts for
a crime he has committed. tr. S. v. Wilson, 7 Pet.
160, 8 L.Ed. 640; Ex parte Garland, 4 Wall. 380,
18 L.Ed. 366; Ex parte Wells, 18 How. 307, 15 L.
Ed. 421; Moore v. State, 43 N.J.Law, 241, 39 Am.
Rep. 558; Ex parte Rice, 72 Tex.Cr.R. 587, 162 S.
W. 891, 899; People v. Hale, 64 Cal.App. 523, 222
P. 148, 151; Ex parte Miers, 124 Tex.Cr.R. 592, 64
S.W.2d 778.
It releases punishment and blots out the exist-
ence of guilt, so that in the eyes of the law the
offender is as innocent as if he had never commit-
ted the offense. U. S. ex rel. Palermo v. Smith,
C.C.A.N.Y., 17 F.2d 534, 535; Ex parte Jones, 25
Okl.Cr. 347, 220 P. 978, 34 A.L.R. 206. It implies
guilt and does not proceed on the theory of inno-
cence of the person pardoned. State v. Cullen, 14
Wash.2d 105, 127 P.2d 257, 259.
A "pardon" releases the offender from the entire punish-
ment prescribed for the offense, and from all the disabili-
ties consequent on his conviction, while by a "parole" a
convict is merely released before the expiration of his
term, to remain subject during the remainder thereof to
supervision by the public authority, and to return to im-
prisonment on violation of the condition of the parole.
Board of Prison Com'rs v. De Moss, 157 Ky. 289, 163 S.W.
183, 187.
A pardon, to be effective, must be accepted; Burdick v.
U. S., 35 S.Ct. 267, 268, 236 U.S. 79, 59 L.Ed. 476; but a
commutation is merely a cessation of the exercise of sover-
eign authority, and does not obliterate guilt nor restore
civil rights, and need not be accepted by the convict to be
operative; Chapman v. Scott, D.C.Conn., 10 F.2d 156, 159;
In re Charles, 115 Kan. 323, 222 P. 606, 608. A commuta-
tion is simply a remission of a part of the punishment, a
substitution of a less penalty for the one originally im-
posed; State v. District Court of Eighteenth Judicial Dist.
in and for Blaine County, 73 Mont. 541, 237 P. 525, 527;
while a "pardon" avoids or terminates punishment for
crime; U. S. v. Commissioner of Immigration at Port of
New York, C.C.A.N.Y., 5 F.2d 162, 165.
The distinction between amnesty and pardon is one
rather of philological interest than of legal importance.
Knote v. U. S., 95 U.S. 149, 153, 24 L.Ed. 442, 443. This
is so as to their ultimate effect, but there are incidental
differences of importance. They are of different char-
acter and have different purposes. The one overlooks of-
fense; the other remits punishment. The first is usually
addressed to crimes against the sovereignty of the state,
to political offenses, forgiveness being deemed more ex-
pedient for the public welfare than prosecution and pun-
ishment. The second condones infractions of the peace of
the state. Amnesty is usually general, addressed to classes
or even communities-a legislative act, or under legislation,
constitutional or statutory-the act of the supreme magis-
trate. There may or may not be distinct acts of accept-
ance. If other rights are dependent upon it and are as-
serted, there is affirmative evidence of acceptance. Bur-
dick v. U. S., 35 S.Ct. 267, 236 U.S. 79, 271, 59 L.Ed. 476.
"Pardon" applies only to the individual, releases him from
the punishment fixed by law for his specific offense, but
does not affect the criminality of the same or similar acts
when performed by other persons or repeated by the same
person.
Absolute or Unconditional Pardon. One which
frees the criminal without any condition what-
ever. That which reaches both the punishment
prescribed for the offense and the guilt of the of-
fender. It obliterates in legal contemplation the
offense itself. Ex parte Collins, 32 Okl.Cr. 6, 239
P. 693, 696. It goes no further than to restore the
accused to his civil rights and remit the penalty
imposed for the particular offense of which he was
convicted in so far as it remains unpaid. State v.
Cullen, 14 Wash.2d 105, 127 P.2d 257, 259.
Conditional Pardon. One to, which a condition is
annexed, performance of which is necessary to
the validity of the pardon. Ex parte Hunt, 10
Ark. 284; State v. Fuller, 1 McCord, S.C., 178. A
pardon which does not become operative until
the grantee has performed some specific act, or
where it becomes void when some specific even
transpires. Ex parte Collins. 32 Okl.Cr. 6, 239 P.
693, 697. One granted on the condition that i
shall only endure until the voluntary doing of
some act by the person pardoned, or that it shall
be revoked by a subsequent act on his part, as
that he shall leave the state and never return
Ex parte Janes, 1 Nev. 319; State V. Wolfer, 5
Minn. 135, 54 N.W. 1065, 19 L.R.A. 783, 39 Am.St.
Rep. 582; State v. Barnes, 32 S.C. 14, 10 S.E. 611,
6 L.R.A. 743, 17 Am.St.Rep. 832; People v. Burns,
77 Hun, 92, 28 N.Y.S. 300.
Full pardon. One freely and unconditionally
absolving party from all legal consequences, direct
• and collateral, of crime and conviction. Warren
v. State, 127 Tex.Cr.R. 71, 74 S.W.2d 1006, 1008.
Executive pardon. See Executive Pardon.
General Pardon. One granted to all the persons
participating in a given criminal or treasonable
offense (generally political), or to all offenders of
a given class or against a certain statute or within
certain limits of time. But "amnesty" is the more
appropriate term for this. It may be express, as
when a general declaration is made that all of-
fenders of a certain class shall be pardoned, or
implied, as in case of the repeal of a penal statute.
Roberts v. State, 2 Over. (Tenn.) 423.
Partial pardon. That which remits only por-
tion of punishment or absolves from only por-
tion of legal consequences of crime. Warren v.
State, 127 Tex.Cr.R. 71, 74 S.W.2d 1006, 1008.

## PARDONERS

carried about the pope's indulgences, and sold
them to any who would buy them.

## PARENS

Lat. In Roman law. A parent; orig-
inally and properly only the father or mother of
the person spoken of; but also, by an extension of
its meaning, any relative, male or female, in the
line of direct ascent.

## "PARENS" EST NOMEN GENERALE AD OM- NE GENUS COGNATIONIS

"Parent" is a
name general for every kind of relationship. Co.
Litt. 80; Littleton § 108; Mag. Cart. Joh. c. 50.

## PARENS PATRLZE

Father of his country; par-
ent of the country. In England, the king. In the
United States, the state, as a sovereign-referring
to the sovereign power of guardianship over per-
sons under disability; In re Turner, 94 Kan. ns,
145 P. 871, 872, Ann.Cas.1916E, 1022; such as min-
ors, and insane and incompetent persons; McIn-
tosh v. Dill, 86 Okl. 1, 205 R 917, 925.

## PARENT

187; In re Tombo, 86 Misc. 361, 149 N.Y.S. 219,
221; One who procreates, begets, or brings forth
offspring. McDonald v. Texas Employers' Ins.
Ass'n, Tex.Civ.App., 267 S.W. 1074, 1075.
This word is distinguished from "ancestors" in including
only the immediate progenitors of the person, while the
latter embraces his more remote relatives in the ascending
line. The word "parents" should therefore not ordinarily
be construed to include grandparents. In re Spooner's Es-
tate, 172 Wis. 174, 177 N.W. 598, 600. But by the civil law,
grandfathers and grandmothers, and other ascendants,
were, in certain cases, considered parents. Dict. de Jur.
Parents; Corn. v. Anderson, 1 Ashm. (Pa.) 55; 2 Kent 159;
5 East 223.
The term literally can apply only to a father or mother
related by blood, including the parent of an illegitimate
child; Commonwealth v. Wibner, 73 Pa.Super.Ct. 349, 351;
and excluding a stepfather or stepmother or one standing
in loco parentis; State v. District Court of Second Judi-
cial Dist. of Montana in and for Silver Bow County, 66
Mont. 427, 213 P. 802, 804; State v. Barger, 14 Ohio App.

Coakley v. Coakley, 216 Mass. 71, 102 N.E. 930, 932, Ann.
Cas.1915A, 867. In statutes, however, the word is com-
monly construed as including a stepmother; State v.
Juvenile Court of Ramsey County, 163 Minn. 312, 204 N.W.
21, 22, (see. also, Sovereign Camp, W. O. W., v. Cole, 124
Miss. 299, 86 80. 802, 804); and likewise adopting parents;

Yates' Estate, 108 Kan. 721, 196 P. 1077; but not as includ-
ing the father of an illegitimate child; People v. Rupp,
219 Ill.App. 269, 271; Howard v. U. S., D.C.Ky., 2 F.2d
170, 173; Ex parte Newsome, 212 Ala. 168, 102 So. 216,

## PARENTAGE

Kindred in the direct ascending
line. See 2 Bouv. Inst. n. 1955.

## PARENTELA

The sum of those persons who
trace descent from one ancestor. 2 Poll. & Maitl.
In old English law. Parentela, or de parentela
se tollere, signified a renunciation of one's kindred
and family. This was, according to ancient cus-
tom, done in open court, before the judge, and in
the presence of twelve men, who made oath that
they believed it was done for a just cause. We
read of it in the laws of Henry I. After such ab-
juration, the person was incapable of inheriting
anything from any of his relations, etc. Enc.
Lond.

## PARENTHESIS

Part of a sentence occurring in
the middle thereof, and inclosed between marks
like ( ), the omission of which part would not in-
jure the grammatical construction of the rest of
the sentence. Wharton; In re Schilling, 53 Fed.

## PARES

Lat. A person's peers or equals; as
the jury for the trial of causes, who were orig-
inally the vassals or tenants of the lord, being the
equals or peers of the parties litigant; and, as
the lord's vassals judged each other in the lord's
courts, so the sovereign's vassals, or the lords
themselves, judged each other in the sovereign's
courts. 3 Bl. Comm. 349.

## PARES CURIE

Peers of the court. . Vassals
who were bound to attend the lord's court.

## PARES REGNI

Popularly, but not very correctly, called "soften-
The term is applied to a group of mental and
bodily symptoms, developing usually late in life
and as a result of previous syphilis. The condi-
tion differs from the various insanities, in that
definite alterations of the surface of the brain and
its membranes are found, in the form of chronic
inflammation. Loss of memory, passionate out-
bursts, delusions of grandeur, restlessness and in-
somnia, with final absolute dementia, are the
chief mental symptoms, while physically muscu-
lar weakness, tremor, particularly of the lips and
tongue, ataxia, and various convulsive seizures
are seen. Losh v. Winters Nat. Bank & Trust

86 N.E.2d 903, 906.

## PARI PASSU

Lat. By an equal progress; equa-

## PARI PASSU BONDS

A name given in Scot-
land to certain bonds secured upon lands which
share an equal benefit of the security. Where sev-
eral securities are created over the same lands
by separate bonds and dispositions in security,
they would ordinarily have priority according to-
the date of registration of the sasine or bond, as
the case may be. If it is intended to have them
rank as pari passu, it is usual to insert a clause
in each bond declaring that they shall be so-
ranked without regard to their priority of regis-
tration. 9 Jurid. Rev. 74.

## PARI RATIONE

Lat. For the like reason; by

## PARTIES

The persons who take part in the
performance of any act, or who are directly in-
terested in any affair, contract, or conveyance, or
who are actively concerned in the prosecution and
defense of any legal proceeding. U. S. to Use of
Edward Hines Lumber Co. v. Henderlong, C.C.Ind.,
102 F. 2; Robbins v. Chicago, 4 Wall. 672, 18 L.
Ed. 427; Green v. Bogue, 15 S.Ct. 975, 158 U.S. 478,
39 L.Ed. 1061; Hughes v. Jones, 116 N.Y. 67, 22 N.
E. 446, 5 L.R.A. 637, 15 Am.St.Rep. 386. See also
Party.
In the Roman civil law, the parties were desig-
nated as "actor" and "recs." In the common law,
they are called "plaintiff" and "defendant;" in
real actions, "demandant" and "tenant;" in equity,
"complainant" or "plaintiff" and "defendant;" in
Scotch law, "pursuer" and "defender;" in ad-
miralty practice, "libelant" and "respondent;" in
appeals, "appellant" and "respondent," sometimes,
"plaintiff in error" and "defendant in error;" in
criminal proceedings, "prosecutor" and "prisoner."
Classification
Formal, or proper parties are those who have
no interest in the controversy between the imme-
diate litigants, but have an interest in the subject-
matter which may be conveniently settled in the
suit, and thereby prevent further litigation; they
may be male parties or not, at the option of the
complainant. Chadbourne v. Coe, 2 C.C.A. 327,
51 F. 479; Sexton v. Sutherland, 37 N.D. 500, 164
N.W. 278, 281; Consolidated Gas Co. of New York
v. Newton, D.C.N.Y., 256 F. 238, 245; State v.
Municipal Savings & Loan Co., 111 Ohio St. 178,
144 N.E. 736, 740. Necessary parties are those
parties who have such an interest in the subject-
matter of a suit in equity, or whose rights are so
involved in the controversy, that no complete and
effective decree can be made, disposing of the mat-
ters in issue and dispensing complete justice, un-
less they are before the court in such a manner
as to entitle them to be heard in vindication or
protection of their interests. Chandler v. Ward,
188 Ill. 322, 58 N.E. 919; Chadbourne v. Coe, 2 C.
C.A. 327, 51 F. 480; Burrill v. Garst, 19 R.I. 38,
31 A. 436; Castle v. Madison, 113 Wis. 346, 89 N.
Co., 24 Wis. 132. Nominal parties are those who
are joined as plaintiffs or defendants, not because
they have any real interest in the subject-matter
or because any relief is demanded as against them,
but merely because the technical rules of plead-
ing require their presence on the record. It should
be noted that some courts make a further distinc-
tion between "necessary" parties and "indispensa-
ble" parties. Thus, it is said that the supreme
court of the United States divides parties in equity
suits into three different classes: (1) Formal par-
ties, who have no interest in the controversy be-
tween the immediate litigants, but have such an
interest in the subject-matter as may be conven-
iently settled in the suit, and thereby prevent fur-
ther litigation; (2) necessary parties, who have
an interest in the controversy, but whose interests
are separable from those of the parties before the
court, and will not be directly affected by a decree
which does complete and full justice between
them; (3) indispensable parties, who not only
have an interest in the subject-matter of the con-
troversy, but an interest of such a nature that a
final decree cannot be made without either affect-
ing their interests or leaving the controversy in
such a condition that its final determination may
be wholly inconsistent with equity and good con-
science. Hicklin v. Marco, 6 C.C.A.10, 56 F. 552,
citing Shields v. Barrow, 17 How. 139, 15 L.Ed. 158;

more v. Darragh, Tex.Civ.App., 227 S.W. 522, 523;

## PARTIES AND PRIVIES

Parties to a deed or
contract are those with whom the deed or con-
tract is actually made or entered into. By the
term "privies," as applied to contracts, is fre-
quently meant those between whom the contract
is mutually binding, although not literally parties
to such contract. Thus, in the case of a lease, the
lessor and lessee are both parties and privies, the
contract being literally made between the two, and
also being mutually binding; but, if the lessee as-
sign his interest to a third party, then a privity
arises between the assignee and the original les-
sor, although such assignee is not literally a party
to the original lease. Brown.

## PARTIES IN INTEREST

Under General Order
6 (11 U.S.C.A. § 53) respecting transfer of bank-
ruptcy proceedings for the greatest convenience
of "parties in interest," the term "parties in in-
terest" includes not only general creditors, but
prior and secured creditors as well, and also the
bankrupt and every other party, whose pecuniary
interest is affected by the proceedings. In re De-
vonian Mineral Spring Co, D.C.Ohio, 272 F. 527,
PARTITIO. Lat. In the civil law. Partition; di-
vision. This word did not always signify dimi-
dium, a dividing into halves. Dig. 50, 16, 164, 1.

## PARTITIO LEGATA

A testamentary partition.
This took place where the testator, in his will,
directed the heir to divide the inheritance and
deliver a designated portion thereof to a named
legatee. See Mackeld. Rom. Law, §§ 781, 785.
rARTITION. The dividing of lands held by joint
tenants, coparceners, or tenants in common, into
distinct portions, so that they may hold them in
severalty. And, in a less technical sense, any di-
vision of real or personal property between co-
owners or co-proprietors. Meacham v. Meacham,
91 Tenn. 532, 19 S.W. 757; Hudgins v. Sansom,
72 Tex. 229, 10 S.W. 104; Weiser v. Weiser, 5
Watts, Pa., 279, 30 Am.Dec. 313; Thomason v.
Thompson, 123 Okl. 218, 253 P. 99, 102; Gillespie
v. Jackson, 153 Tenn. 150, 281 S.W. 929, 932.
Partition does not create or convey a new or additional
title or interest but merely severs the unity of possession.

Bl.Comm. 323, 324.
Partition of a Succession. The partition of a
succession is the division of the effects of which
the succession is composed, among all the co-heirs,
according to their respective rights. Partition is
voluntary or judicial. It is voluntary when it is
made among all the co-heirs present and of age,
and by their mutual consent. It is judicial when
it is made by the authority of the court, and ac-
cording to the formalities prescribed by law.
Every partition is either definitive or provisional.
Definitive partition is that which is made in a per-
manent and irrevocable manner. Provisional par-
tition is that which is made provisionally, either of
certain things before the rest can be divided, or
even of everything that is to be divided, when the
parties are not in a situation to make an irrevoca-
ble partition. Civ. Code La. art. 1293, et seq.

third parties. Dormant partners, in strictness of
language, mean those who are merely passive in
the firm, whether known or unknown, in contra-
distinction to those who are active and conduct
the business of the firm, as principals. Story,

## PARTY

A person concerned or having or tak-
ing part in any affair, matter, transaction, or pro-
ceeding, considered individually. See Parties.
"Party" is a technical word, and has a precise meaning
in legal parlance. By it is understood he or they by or
against whom a suit is brought, whether in law or equity;
the party plaintiff or defendant, whether composed of one
or more individuals, and whether natural or legal persons,
(they are parties in the writ, and parties on the record ; )
and all others who may be affected by the suit, indirectly
or consequentially, are persons interested, but not parties.
Merchants' Bank v. Cook, 4 Pick. 405.
"Party" is not restricted to strict meaning of plaintiff or
defendant in a lawsuit, being defined as one concerned in
or privy to a matter as in the relation of accessory or con-
fidant, and again a partial person, one who takes sides.
State v. Orr, 53 Idaho 452, 24 P.2d 679.
Party aggrieved. Under statutes permitting
any party aggrieved to appeal, one whose right
has been directly and injuriously affected by ac-
tion of court. Freeman v. Thompson, 216 N.C.
484, 5 S.E.2d 434, 436. Singer v. Allied Factors,
216 Minn. 443, 13 N.W.2d 378, 380.
Party and party. This phrase signifies the con-
tending parties in an action; e., the plaintiff and
defendant, as distinguished from the attorney and
his client. It is used in connection with the sub-
ject of costs, which are differently taxed between
party and party and between attorney and client.
Brown.
Party injured. As used in divorce statute giv-
ing right of action only to party injured means
party wronged by action of the other. Byers v.
Byers, 223 N.C. 85, 25 S.E.2d 466, 469.
Party to be charged. A phrase used in the stat-
ute of frauds, meaning the party against whom
the contract is sought to be enforced. Dominion
Oil Co. v. Pou, Tex.Civ.App., 253 S.W. 317, 320;
Kingfisher Mill & Elevator Co. v. Westbrook, 79
Okl. 188, 192 P. 209, 212. The party to be charged
in the action—that is, the defendant. Jones v.
School Dist. No. 48, 137 Ark. 414, 208 S.W. 798, 799;
Graham v. Henderson Elevator Co., 60 Ind.App.
697, 111 N.E. 332, 335; Also, the vendor. Henry
v. Reeser, 153 Ky. 8, 154 S.W. 371, 373; Kaiser v.
Jones, 157 Ky. 607, 163 S.W. 741, 742; The owner
of the realty rather than the party attempted to
be charged or held liable in an action based on
the memorandum. Lusky v. Keiser, 128 Tenn. 705,
164 S.W. 777, 778, L.R.A.1915C, 400.
Real party. In statutes requiring suits to be
brought in the name of the "real party in inter-
est," this term means the person who is actually
and substantially interested in the subject-matter,
as distinguished from one who has only a nomin-
al, formal, or technical interest in it or connection
with it. Hoagland v. Van Etten, 22 Neb. 681, 35
N.W. 870; Gruber v. Baker, 20 Nev. 453, 23 P. 858,
9 L.R.A. 302; Chew v. Brumagen, 13 Wall. 504, 20
L.Ed. 663. Gay v. Jackson County Board of Edu-
cation, 205 Ky. 277, 265 S.W. 772, 773; Taylor v.
Hurst, 186 Ky. 71, 216 S.W. 95, 96; Rothwell v.
Knight, 37 Wyo. 11, 258 P. 576, 582.
Third parties. A term used to include all per-
sons who are not parties to the contract, agree-
ment, or instrument of writing by which their
interest in the thing conveyed is sought to be af-
fected. Morrison v. Trudeau (La.) 1 Mart., N.S.,
384. But it is difficult to give a very definite idea
of third persons; for sometimes those who are not
parties to the contract, but who represent the
rights of the original parties, as executors, are not
to be considered third persons. 1 Bouvier, Inst. n.
1335. In statutes the words may have special
Flemming v. Drake, 163 Ga. 872, 137 S.E. 268, 270;

one owner, and partly on the land of another, for

used in the construction of contiguous buildings.
Brown v. Werner, 40 Md. 19. In the primary and
most ordinary meaning of the term, a party-wall
is (1) a wall of which the two adjoining owners
are tenants in common. But it may also mean
(2) a wall divided longitudinally into two strips,
one belonging to each of the neighboring owners ;
(3) a wall which belongs entirely to one of the
adjoining owners, but is subject to an easement
or right in the other to have it maintained as a
dividing wall between the two tenements, (the
term is so used in some of the English building
acts;) or (4) a wall divided longitudinally into
two moieties, each moiety being subject to a cross-
easement in favor of the owner of the other moie-
ty. Sweet. Gates v. Friedman, 83 W.Va. 710, 98 S.

value equal to the debt or liability. Crutchfield v. Johnson
& Latimer, 243 Ala. 73, 8 So.2d 412, 414. "Payment" of a
debt involves both tender by debtor with intention to pay
debt, and acceptance by creditor. In re McElmurray, D.C.
S.C., 47 F.Supp. 15, 19. Anything delivered and accepted
in discharge of obligation is payment of debt. Barret v.
Clarke, 226 Ky. 109, 9 S.W.2d 1091, 1093.
Though "payment" in a broad sense includes money or

faction of his debt, it means in its restricted sense full
satisfaction paid by money and not by exchange or com-
promise or by an accord and satisfaction. Roach v. Mc-
Donald, 187 Ala. 64, 65 So. 823. "Payment" is generally
understood to mean a discharge by a compliance with the
terms of the obligation or its equivalent, while in an "ac-
cord and satisfaction" the discharge is effected by the per-
formance of terms other than those originally agreed on.
Barcus v. J. I. Case Threshing Mach. Co., Tex.Civ.App.,
197 S.W. 478, 480.

has paid the debt or claim laid in the declaration,

General
Part payment. The reduction of any debt or
demand by the payment of a sum less than the
whole amount originally due. Young v. Perkins,
29 Minn. 173, 12 N.W. 515; Moffitt v. Carr, 48
Neb. 403, 67 N.W. 150, 58 Am.St.Rep. 696.
Partial payments. The United States rule of
partial payments is to apply the payment, in
the first place, to the discharge of the interest
then due. If the payment exceeds the interest,
the surplus goes toward discharging the princi-
pal, and the subsequent interest is to be computed
on the balance of principal remaining due. If the
payment be less than the interest, the surplus of
the interest must not be taken to augment the
principal; but interest continues on the former
principal until the period of time when the pay-
ments, taken together, exceed the interest then
due, to discharge which they are applied, and the
surplus, if any, is to be applied towards the dis-
charge of the principal, and the interest is to be
computed on the balance as aforesaid, and this
process continues until final settlement. Langton
v. Kops, 41 N.D. 442, 171 N.W. 334, 336.
Payment into court. In practice. The act of a
defendant in depositing the amount which he ad-
mits to be due, with the proper officer of the court,
for the benefit of the plaintiff and in answer to
his claim.

debtor of his own will and choice, as distinguished
tion or other compulsion. Redmond v. New York,
125 N.Y. 632, 26 N.E. 727; Rumford Chemical
Works v. Ray, 19 R.I. 456, 34 A. 814; St. Johns
Electric Co. v. City of St. Augustine, 81 Fla. 588,
88 So. 387; Greene v. E. H. Taylor, Jr. & Sons,
184 Ky. 739, 212 S.W. 925, 928. Payments may be
voluntary which are made unwillingly as a choice
of evils. Singer Sewing Mach. Co. v. Teasley,
198 Ala. 673, 73 So. 969, 971. But money paid
under a mistake of the facts is not ordinarily
treated as ,falling within the rule that money paid
with full knowledge of all the facts relating to
the claim paid constitutes a voluntary payment,
and cannot be recovered back. Strong & Jarvis v.
Oldsmobile Co. of Vermont, 96 Vt. 355, 120 A. 100,
PAYS. Fr. Country. Trial per pays, trial by
jury, (the country.) See Pais.

Great Britain, being the lords temporal having
seats in parliament, and including dukes, marquis-
es, earls, viscounts, and barons.
Equals; those who are a man's equals in rank
and station; thus "trial by a jury of his peers"
means trial by jury of citizens. In re Grilli, 110
Misc. 45, 179 N.Y.S. 795, 797. For "judgment of
his peers," see Judgment.

## PEERS OF FEES

putes arising upon fees; but, if there were too

twelve, who had the title of peers, by way of
distinction; whence, it is said, we derive our
common juries and other peers. Cowell.

## PEINE FORTE ET DURE

lish law. A special form of punishment for those

## PENAL ACTION

In practice. An action upon a

penalty given by statute. 3 Steph. 535, 536;
Smith Engineering Works v. Custer, 194 Okl. 318,
151 P.2d 404, 407, 408. An action which enforces
a forfeiture or penalty for transgressing the law.
The term "penal" is broader than "criminal," and
relates to actions which are not necessarily crim-
inal as well. The term "penalty" in its broad
sense is a generic term which includes fines as
well as other kinds of punishment, but in its nar-
rowest sense is the amount recovered for violation
of the statute law of the state or a municipal or-
dinance, which violation may or may not be a
crime, and the term applies mostly to a pecuniary
punishment. The word "forfeiture" is frequently
used in civil as well as criminal law, and it is
also used in actions for a penalty, although the
action is a civil one. Silberman v. Skouras Thea-
tres Corporation, 11 N.J.Misc. 907, 169 A. 170, 171.
Distinguished from a popular or qui tam action, in which
the action is brought by the informer, to whom part of
the penalty goes. A penal action or information is brought
by an officer, and the penalty goes to the king. 1 Chit.
Gen.Pr. 25, note; 2 Archb. Pr. 188. But in American law,
the term includes actions brought by informers or other
private persons, as well as those instituted by governments
or public officers. In a broad sense, the term has been
made to include all actions in which there may be a re-
covery of exemplary or vindictive damages, as suits for
libel and slander, or in which special, double, or treble
damages are given by statute, such as actions to recover
money paid as usury or lost in gaming. See Bailey v.
Dean, 5 Barb., N.Y., 303; Ashley v. Frame, 4 Kan.App.
265, 45 P. 927; Cole v. Groves, 134 Mass. 472. But in a
more particular sense it means (1) an action on a statute
which gives a certain penalty to be recovered by any per-
son who will sue for it. Gawthrop v. Fairmont Coal Co.,
74 W.Va. 39, 81 S.E. 560, 561; McNeely v. City of Natchez,
148 Miss. 268, 114 So. 484, 487, or (2) an action in which
the judgment against the defendant is in the nature of a
fine or is intended as a punishment, actions in which the
recovery is to be compensatory in its purpose and effect
not being penal actions but civil suits, though they may
carry special damages by statute. Moller v. U. S., 6 C.C.
A. 459, 57 F. 490; Atlanta v. Chattanooga Foundry & Pipe
Works, 61 C.C.A. 387, 127 F. 23, 64 L.R.A. 721.

## PENAL BILL

An instrument formerly in use,
by which a party bound himself to pay a certain
sum or sums of money, or to do certain acts, or,
in default thereof, to pay a certain specified sum
by way of penalty; thence termed a "penal sum."
These instruments have been superseded by the
use of a bond in a penal sum, with conditions.
Brown.

## PENAL BOND

A promise to pay a named sum
of money, the penalty, with a condition underwrit-
ten that, if a stipulated collateral thing, other than
the payment of money, be done or forborne, the
obligation shall be void. Maryland Casualty Co.
v, Kansas City, Mo., C.C.A.Mo., 128 F.2d 998, 1004.

## PENAL CLAUSE

A secondary obligation en-
tered into for purpose of enforcing performance
of a primary obligation, and nature of penalty is
by way of compensation for damages and not as
punishment for failure to perform obligation.
Civ.Code, art. 2117. Reimann v. New Orleans
Public Service, 191 La. 1079, 187 So. 30, 31, 32. Al-
so a clause in a statute declaring a penalty for a
violation of the preceding clauses.

## PENAL LAWS

Those which prohibit an act
and impose a penalty for the commission of it.
2 Cro.Jac. 415. Strictly and properly speaking, a
penal law is one imposing a penalty or punish-
ment (and properly a pecuniary fine or mulct)
for some offense of a public nature or wrong com-
mitted against the state. Kilton v. Providence
Tool Co., 22 R.I. 605, 48 A. 1039; Wellman v.
Mead, 93 Vt. 322, 107 A. 396, 397; Atlantic Coast
Line R. Co. v. State, 73 Fla. 609, 74 So. 595, 600.
Strictly speaking, statutes giving a private ac-
tion against a wrongdoer are not penal in their
nature, neither the liability imposed nor the rem-
edy given being penal. If the wrong done is to
the individual, the law giving him a right of ac-
tion is remedial, rather than penal, though the
sum to be recovered may be called a "penalty"
or may consist in double or treble damages. See
Huntington v. Attrill, 13 S.Ct. 224, 146 U.S. 657,
36 L.Ed. 1123; Diversey v. Smith, 103 Ill. 390, 42
Am.Rep. _14; Cullinan v. Burkhard, 41 Misc. 321,
84 N.Y.S. 825; Credit Men's Adjustment Co. v.
Vickery, 62 Colo. 214, 161 P. 297, 298.
Where a statute is both penal and remedial, as where it
is penal in one part and remedial in the other, it should be
considered as a "penal statute" when it is sought to en-
force the penalty, and as a "remedial statute" when it is
sought to enforce the remedy. Collins v. Kidd, D.C.Tex.,
38 F.Supp. 634, 637.

## PENAL SERVITUDE

168 P. 815, 816. A punishment; a punishment im-

C.C., 37 F. 497, 3 L.R.A. 554; Miller v. Bopp, 136
La. 788, 67 So. 831. Also money recoverable by
virtue of a statute imposing a payment by way
of punishment. City of Buffalo v. Neubeck, 209

lin, 63 Utah, 442, 226 P. 674, 676. Brown v. Corn-
mins Distilleries Corporation, D.C.Ky., 56 F.Supp.
941, 942.
To constitute a "punishment" or "penalty" there must
be a deprivation of property or some right, such as the

tion exists, even though it is determined that no
cause of action is made out under federal grounds.

F.Supp. 179, 191. The test is whether substantial-

The word "people" may have various significations ac-
cording to the connection in which it is used. When we
speak of the rights of the people, or of the government of
the people by law, or of the people as a non-political ag-
gregate, we mean all the inhabitants of the state or nation,
without distinction as to sex, age, or otherwise. But when

## PERAMBULATION

The act or custom of walk-
ing over the boundaries of a district or piece of
land, either for the purpose of determining them

fected invention; not a perfectly constructed
machine, but a machine so constructed as to em-
body all the essential elements of the invention, in
a form that would make them practical and opera-
tive so as to accomplish the result.

result in the most perfect manner, and be in a condition

Fed. Cas. 647.

tract is to execute, fulfill, or accomplish it ac-
cording to its terms. This may consist either in
action on the part of the person bound by the con-
tract or in omission to act, according to the nature
of the subject-matter; but the term is usually
applied to any action in discharge of a contract
other than payment.

## PERFORMANCE

The fulfillment or accomplish-
ment of a promise, contract, or other obligation
according to its terms.
Part Performance. The doing some portion,
yet not the whole, of what either party to a
contract has agreed to do. Borrow v. Borrow,
34 Wash. 684, 76 P. 305.
The "part performance" necessary to take oral contract
to sell realty out of the statute of frauds must be of such
character that it is impossible or impracticable to place the
parties in status quo and payment in full is not sufficient.
Rork v. Orcutt, 53 N.Y.S.2d 354, 356. The possession neces-
sary to constitute "part performance" which will take an
oral agreement, purporting to convey an interest in land,
out of the operation of the statute of frauds must be un-
equivocal and in consequence of the contract. Guckenberg-
er v. Shank, 110 Ind.App. 442, 37 N.E.2d 708, 714.
Specific Performance. Performance of a con-
tract in the specific form in which it was made, or
according to the precise terms agreed upon. This
is frequently compelled by a bill in equity filed for
the purpose. 2 Story, Eq.P1. § 712, et seq. The
actual accomplishment of a contract by a party
bound to fulfil} it. Guadalupe County Board of
Education v. O'Bannon, 26 N.M. 606, 195 P. 801,
803; Municipal Gas Co. v. Lone Star Gas Co., Tex.
Civ.App., 259 S.W. 684, 689. The doctrine of spe-
cific performance is that, where damages would
be an inadequate compensation for the breach
of an agreement, the contractor will be compelled
to perform specifically what he has agreed to do.
Sweet. As the exact fulfillment of an agreement
is not always practicable, the phrase may mean,
in a given case, not literal, but substantial per-
formance. Waterm.Spec.Perf. § 1.

## PERICULUM REI VENDITA, NONDUM TRA- DIME, EST EMPTORIS

The risk of a thing
sold, and not yet delivered, is the purchaser's. 2
Kent, Comm. 498, 499,
PERIL. The risk, hazard, or contingency insured
against by a policy of insurance.
Peril within humanitarian doctrine means certain peril,
not bare possibility of injury. Thomasson v. Henwood,
235 Mo.App. 1211, 146 S.W.2d 88, 91.

## PERILS OF THE LAKES

As applied to naviga-
tion of the Great Lakes, this term has the same
meaning as "perils of the sea." See infra.

## PERILS OF THE SEA

In maritime and insur-
ance law. Natural accidents peculiar to the sea,
which do not happen by the intervention of man,
nor are to be prevented by human prudence. 3
Kent, Comm. 216. Hence to recover on marine
policy insuring against loss by perils of sea, ves-
sel must be seaworthy when it is sent to sea.
Read v. Agricultural Ins. Co., 219 Wis. 580, 263
N.W. 632. Perils of the sea are from (1) storms
and waves; (2) rocks, shoals, and rapids; (3)
other obstacles, though of human origin; (4)
changes of climate; (5) the confinement neces-
sary at sea; (6) animals peculiar to the sea; (7)
all other dangers peculiar to the sea. Civ.Code
Cal. § 2199. All losses caused by the action of
wind and water acting on the property insured un-
der extraordinary circumstances, either directly
or mediately, without the intervention of other in-
dependent active external causes, are losses by
"perils of the sea or other perils and dangers,"
within the meaning of the usual clause in a policy
of marine insurance. Baily, Perils of Sea, 6. In
an enlarged sense, all losses which occur from
maritime adventure may be said to arise from
the perils of the sea; but underwriters are not
bound to this extent. They insure again4t losses
from extraordinary occurrences only; such as
stress of weather, winds and waves, lightning,
tempests, etc. These are understood to be meant
by the phrase "the perils of the sea," in a marine
policy, and not those ordinary perils which every
vessel must encounter. American-Hawaiian S. S.
Co. v. Bennett & Goodall, 125 C.C.A. 172, 207 F.
510, 513; The Mary F. Barrett, C.C.A.Pa., 279 F.
329, 331; Delanty v. Yang Tsze Ins. Ass'n, 127
Wash. 238, 220 P. 754, 758; Western Assur. Co. of
Toronto, Canada, v. Shaw, C.C.A.Pa., 11 F.2d 495,
496; Union Marine Ins. Co. v. Chas. D. Stone &
Co., C.C.A.Ill., 15 F.2d 937, 939.
" 'Perils of the sea' means all marine casualties resulting
from the violent action of the elements, as distinguished
from their natural, silent influence upon the fabric of tire
vessel; casualties which may, and not consequences which
must, occur." Pillsbury Flour Mills Co. v. Becker S. S.
Co., D.C.N.Y., 49 F.2d 648, 650.

## PERINDE VALERE

A dispensation granted to
a clerk, who, being defective in capacity for a
benefice or other ecclesiastical function, is de
facto admitted to it. Cowell.
PERIOD, Any point, space, or division of time.
"The word has its etymological meaning, but it also has
a distinctive signification, according to the subject with
which it may be used in connection. It may mean any
portion of complete time, from a thousand years or less to
the period of a day; and when used to designate an act
to be done or to be begun, though its completion may take
an uncertain time, as, for instance, the act of exportation,
it must mean the day on which the exportation commences,
or it would be an unmeaning and useless word in its con-
nection in the statute. Sampson v. Peaslee, 20 How. 579, 15
L. Ed. 1022.

## PERIODICAL

Recurring at fixed intervals; to
be made or done, or to happen, at successive pe-
riods separated by determined intervals of time;
as periodical payments of interest on a bond.

## PERIPHRASIS

Circumlocution; use of many
words to express the sense of one.

## PERISH

To come to an end; to cease to be;
to die.

## PERISHABLE

Subject to speedy and natural
decay. But, where the time contemplated is nec-
essarily long, the term may embrace property li-
able merely to material depreciation in value from
other causes than such decay. Callahan v. Dan-
ziger, 172 Cal. 738, 158 P. 760, 761; Marston v. Rue,
92 Wash. 129, 159 P. 111, 113; In re Pedlow, C.C.
A.N.Y., 209 F. 841, 842; Falmouth Co-op. Market-
ing Ass'n v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 237 Mich. 406,
212 N.W. 84, 85.

## PERISHABLE COMMODITY

A relative term
used ordinarily by courts and lawyers to describe
a product, like fruit or fresh vegetables, which
quickly deteriorates in quality and value. In re
Rosenbaum Grain Corporation, C.C.A.I11., 83 F.
2d 391, 393.

## PERISHABLE GOODS

Goods which decay and
lose their value if not speedily put to their in-
tended use. Kleinpeter v. Ferrara, 179 La. 193,
153 So. 689.
PERJURI SUNT QUI SERVATIS VERBIS JUR-
AMENTI DECIPIUNT AURES EORUM QUI AC-
CIPIUNT. 3 Inst. 166. They are perjured, who,
preserving the words of an oath, deceive the ears
of those who receive it.

## PERJURY

In criminal law. The willful asser-
tion as to a matter of fact, opinion, belief, or
knowledge, made by a witness in a judicial pro-
ceeding as part of his evidence, either upon oath
or in any form allowed by law to be substituted
for an oath, whether such evidence is given in
open court, or in an affidavit, or otherwise, such
assertion being material to the issue or point of
inquiry and known to such witness to be false.
2 Whart.Crim.Law, § 1244; People v. Glenn, 294
Ill. 333, 128 N.E. 532, 533; Mathes v. State, 15
Okl.Cr. 382, 177 P. 120; Commonwealth v. Hinkle,
177 Ky. 22, 197 S.W. 455, 456; People v. Rendigs,
123 Misc.Rep. 32, 205 N.Y.S. 133, 136.
To constitute "perjury" an oath must be administered
by one authorized to do so. People v. Gade, City Ct., 6 N.
Y.S.2d 1018, 1021.
Perjury shall consist in willfully, knowingly, absolutely,
and falsely swearing, either with or without laying the
hand on the Holy Evangelist of Almighty God, or affirming,
in a matter material to the issue or point in question, in
some judicial proceeding, by a person to whom a lawful
oath or affirmation is administered. Code Ga. 1882, § 4460
(Pen. Code 1910, § 259). Every person who, having taken
an oath that he will testify, declare, depose, or certify
truly before any competent tribunal, officer, or person, in
any of the cases in which such an oath may by law be ad-
ministered, willfully, and contrary to such oath, states
as truth any material matter which he knows to be false,
is guilty of perjury. Pen. Code Cal. § 118. The willful
giving, under oath, in a judicial .proceeding or course of
justice, of false testimony material to the issue or point of
inquiry. 2 Bish.Crim. Law, § 1015. Perjury, at common
law, is the "taking of a willful false oath by one who, be-
ing lawfully sworn by a competent court to depose the
truth in any judicial proceeding, swears absolutely and
falsely in a matter material to the point in issue, whether
he believed or not." Comm. v. Powell, 2 Metc. (Ky.) 10;
Cothran v. State, 39 Miss. 541. It will be observed that,
at common law, the crime of perjury can be committed
only in the course of a suit or judicial proceeding. But
statutes have very generally extended both the definition
and the punishment of this offense to willful false swearing
in many different kinds of affidavits and depositions, such
as those required to be made in tax returns, pension pro-
ceedings, transactions at the custom house, and various
other administrative or non-judicial proceedings.

## PERMANENT

Fixed, continuing, lasting, sta-
ble, enduring, abiding, not subject to change.
Generally opposed in law to "temporary," but not
always meaning "perpetual." Penn Mut. Life
Ins. Co. v. Milton, 160 Ga. 168, 127 S.E. 140, 141,
40 A.L.R. 1382; Roseburg Nat. Bank v. Camp, 89
Or. 67, 173 P. 313, 316. Richards v. Metropolitan
Life Ins. Co., 184 Wash. 595, 55 P.2d 1067, 1071.
As to permanent "Alimony," "Injunction," and
"Trespass," see those titles.

## PERMANENT ABODE

A domicile or fixed
home, which the party may leave as his interest
or whim may dictate, but which he has no pres-
ent intention of abandoning. Moffett v. Hill, 131
Ill. 239, 22 N.E. 821; Berry v. Wilcox, 44 Neb. 82,
62 N.W. 249, 48 Am.St.Rep. 706.

## PERMANENT BUILDING AND LOAN ASSO- CIATION

One which issues its stock, not all
at once or in series, but at any time when applica-
tion is made therefor. Cook v. Equitable B. & L.
Ass'n, 104 Ga. 814, 30 S.E. 911.

## PERMANENT DISABILITY

Within insurance
policies does not mean that disability must con-
tinue throughout life of insured, but it connotes
idea that disability must be something more than
temporary, and at least presumably permanent.
Commonwealth Life Ins. Co. v. Ovesen, 257 Ky.
622, 78 S.W.2d 745, 746; Equitable Life Ins. Co. of
Iowa v. Gerwick, 50 Ohio App. 277, 197 N.E. 923,
926; Equitable Life Assur. Soc. of U. S. v. Preston,
253 Ky. 459, 70 S.W.2d 18.

## PERMANENT EMPLOYMENT

Provided for by
contract, means only that employment is to con-
tinue indefinitely and until either party wishes to
sever relation for some good reason. Speegle v.
Board of Fire Underwriters of Pacific, Cal.App.,
158 P.2d 426, 429; Alabama Mills v. Smith, 237
Ala. 296, 186 So. 699, 701.

## PERMISSION

thority to do an act which, without such author-

27, 107 A. 150; State v. Peters, 112 Ohio St. 249,
147 N.E. 81, 84; Little Falls Fibre Co. v. Henry
Ford & Son, 126 Misc. 126, 212 N.Y.S. 630, 634;
Lemery v. Leonard, 99 Or. 670, 196 P. 376, 378;
Armstrong's Adm'r v. Sumne & Ratterman Co.,
211 Ky. 750, 278 S.W. 111, 113; Atwater v. Lober,
133 Misc. 652, 233 N.Y.S. 309, 313.

ity, empowering the grantee to do some act not
forbidden by law, but not allowable without such
authority.

ing therefrom. 2 Bl.Comm. 163.

## PERNOR OF PROFITS

He who receives the
profits of lands, etc.; he who has the actual per-
nancy of the profits.

## PERNOUR

L. Fr. A taker. Le pernour ou le
detenour, the taker or the detainer. Britt. c. 27.

## PERPARS

L. Lat. A purpart; a part of the
inheritance.

## PERPETRATOR

Generally, this term denotes the
person who actually commits a crime or delict, or
by whose immediate agency it occurs. But, where
a servant of a railroad company is killed through
the negligence of a co-employee, the company it-
self may be regarded as the "perpetrator" of the
act, within the meaning of a statute giving an ac-
tion against the perpetrator. Philo v. Illinois
Cent. R. Co., 33 Iowa, 47.
PERPETUA LEX EST NULLAM LEGEM HU-
MANAM AC POSITIVAM PERPETUAM ESSE,
ET CLAUSULA QUIE ABROGATIONEM EX-
CLUDIT AB INITIO NON VALET. It is a per-
petual law that no human and positive law can
be perpetual, and a clause [in a law] which pre-
cludes the power of abrogation is void ab initio.
Bac. Max. p. 77, in reg. 19.

## PERPETUAL

Never ceasing; continuous; en-
during; lasting; unlimited in respect of time;
continuing without intermission or interval.
Scanlan v. Crawshaw, 5 Mo.App. 337.
As to perpetual "Curacy," "Injunction,"
"Lease," and "Statute," see those titles.

## PERPETUAL EDICT

In Roman law. Original:
ly the term "perpetual" was merely opposed to
"occasional" and was used to distinguish the gen-
eral edicts of the praetors from the special edicts
or orders which they issued in their judicial ca-
pacity. But under Hadrian the edict was revised
by the jurist Julianus, and was republished as a
permanent act of legislation. It was then styled
"perpetual," in the sense of being calculated to
endure in perpetuum, or until abrogated by com-
petent authority. Aust.Jur. 855.

## PERPETUAL SUCCESSION

That continuous
existence which enables a corporation to man-
age its affairs, and hold property without the ne-
cessity of perpetual conveyances, for the purpose
of transmitting it. By reason of this quality, this
ideal and artificial person remains, in its legal
entity and personality, the same, though frequent
changes may be made of its members. Field,
Corp. § 58; Scanlan v. Crawshaw, 5 Mo.App. 340.

## PERPETUATING TESTIMONY

A proceeding
for taking and preserving the testimony of wit-
nesses, which otherwise might be lost before the
trial in which it is intended to be used. It is us-
ually allowed where the witnesses are aged and
infirm or are about to remove from the state. 3
Bl.Comm. 450.

## PERPETUITY

Any limitation or condition
which may take away or suspend the power of
alienation for a period beyond life or lives in be-
ing and 21 years thereafter. Loud v. St. Louis
Union Trust Co., 298 Mo. 148, 249 S.W. 629, 634;
Barton v. Thaw, 246 Pa. 348, 92 A. 312, 313, Ann.
Cas.1916D, 570; True Real Estate Co. v. True, 115
Me. 533; 99 A. 627, 630; Melvin v. Hoffman, 290
Mo. 464, 235 S.W. 107, 115. Any limitation tend-
ing to take the subject of it out of commerce for
a longer period than a life or lives in being, and
twenty-one years beyond, and, in case of a post-
humous child, a few months more, allowing for
the term of gestation. Rand.Perp. 48. Such a
limitation of property as renders it unalienable
beyond the period allowed by law. Gilb. Uses,
(Sugd. Ed.) 260. Ould v. Washington Hospital,
95 U.S. 303, 24 L.Ed. 450; Duggan v. Slocum, 34
C.C.A. 676, 92 F. 806; Stevens v. Annex Realty
Co., 173 Mo. 511, 73 S.W. 505; Griffin v. Graham,
8 N.C. 130, 9 Am.Dec. 619; In re John's Will, 30
Or. 494, 47 P. 341, 36 L.R.A. 242. See, also, Rule
Against Perpetuities.

## PERPETUITY OF THE KING

That fiction of
the English law which for certain political pur-
poses ascribes to the king in his political capaci-
ty the attribute of immortality; for, though the
reigning monarch may die, yet by this fiction the
king never dies, i. e., the office is supposed to be
reoccupied for all political purposes immediately
on his death. Brown.

## PERQUISITES

Anything obtained by industry
or purchased with money, different from that
which descends from a father or ancestor. Bract.
1. 2, c. 30, n. 3.
Profits accruing to a lord of a manor by virtue
of his court-baron, over and above the yearly pro-
fits of his land; also other things that come cas-
ually and not yearly. Mozley & Whiteley.
In Modern Use. Emoluments or incidental pro-
fits attaching to an office or official position, be-
yond the salary or regular fees. Harris County
v. Hammond, Tex.Civ.App., 203 S.W. 445, 448;
Christopherson v. Reeves, 44 S.D. 634, 184 N.W.
1015; State v. Reeves, 44 S.D. 568, 184 N.W. 993,
own act or agreement, and not by descent.

## PERQUISITOR

In old English law. A pur-
chaser; one who first acquired an estate to his
family; one who acquired an estate by sale, by
gift, or by any other method, except only that of
descent. 2 Bl.Comm. 220.

## PERSECUTIO

Lat. In the civil law. A follow-
ing after; a pursuing at law; a suit or prosecu-
tion. Properly that kind of judicial proceeding
before the prEetor which was called "extraordina-
ry." In a general sense, any judicial- proceeding,
including not only "actions," (actiones,) properly
so called, but other proceedings also. Calvin.

## PERSEQUI

Lat. In the civil law. To follow
after; to pursue or claim in form of law. An
action is called a "jus persequendi."
PERSON. A man considered according to the
rank he holds in society, with all the right to
which the place he holds entitles him, and the du-
ties which it imposes. People v. R. Co., 134 N.Y.
506, 31 N.E. 873.
The word in its natural and usual signification
includes women as well as men. Commonwealth
v. Welosky, 276 Mass. 398, 177 N.E. 656.
Term may include artificial beings, as corpora-
tions, 1 Bla.Com. 123; 4 Bingh. 669; People
v. Com'rs of Taxes, 23 N.Y. 242; quasi-corpora-
tions, Sedgw. Stat. & Const. L. 372; L. R. 5 App.
Cas. 857; territorial corporations, Seymour v.
School District, 53 Conn. 507, 3 A. 552; and for-
eign corporations, People v. McLean, 80 N.Y. 259;
under statutes, forbidding the taking of property
without due process of law and giving to all per-
sons the equal protection of the laws, Smyth v.
Ames, 18 S.Ct. 418, 169 U.S. 466, 42 L.Ed. 819;
Gulf, C. & S. F. R. Co. v. Ellis, 17 S.Ct. 255, 165
U.S. 150, 41 L.Ed. 666; concerning claims arising
from Indian depredations, U. S. v. Transp. Co.,
17 S.Ct. 206, 164 U.S. 686, 41 L.Ed. 599; relating
to taxation and the revenue laws, People v. Mc-
Lean, 80 N.Y. 254; to attachments, Bray v. Wal-
lingford, 20 Conn. 416; usurious contracts, Phil-
adelphia Loan Co. v. Towner, 13 Conn. 249; ap-
plying to limitation of actions, Olcott v. R. Co., 20
N.Y. 210, 75 Am.Dec. 393; North Mo. R. Co. v.
Akers, 4 Kan. 453, 96 Am.Dec. 183; and concern-
ing the admissibility as a witness of a party in
his own behalf when the opposite party is a liv-
ing person, La Farge v. Ins. Co., 22 N.Y. 352. A.
corporation is also a person under a penal stat-
ute; U. S. v. Amedy, 11 Wheat. 392, 6 L.Ed. 502.
Corporations are "persons" as that word is used
in the first clause of the XIVth Amendment; Cov-
ington & L. Turnp. Co. v. Sandford, 17 S.Ct. 198,
164 U.S. 578, 41 L.Ed. 560; Smyth v. Ames, 18
S.Ct. 418, 169 U.S. 466, 42 L.Ed. 819; People v.
Fire Ass'n, 92 N.Y. 311, 44 Am.Rep. 380; U. S.
v. Supply Co., 30 S.Ct. 15, 215 U.S. 50, 54 L.Ed. 87;
contra, Central P. R. Co. v. Board, 60 Cal. 35.
But a corporation of another state is not a "per-
son" within the jurisdiction of the state until it
has complied with the conditions of admission to
do business in the state, Fire Ass'n of Phila. v.
New York, 7 S.Ct. 108, 119 U.S. 110, 30 L.Ed. 342;
and a statutory requirement of such conditions
is not in conflict with the XIVth Amendment;
Pembina Consol. S. M. & M. Co. v. Pennsylvania,
8 S.Ct. 737, 125 U.S. 181, 189, 31 L.Ed. 650.
It may include partnerships. In re Julian, D.
C.Pa., 22 F.Supp. 97, 99. Also firms. State ex
rel. Joseph R. Peebles Sons Co. v. State Board of
Pharmacy, 127 Ohio St. 513, 189 N.E. 447, 448.
"Persons" are of two kinds, natural and artificial. A
natural person is a human being. Artificial persons in-
clude a collection or succession of natural persons forming
a corporation; a collection of property to which the law
attributes the capacity of having rights and duties. The
latter class of artificial persons is recognized only to a
limited extent in our law. Examples are the estate of a
bankrupt or deceased person. Hogan v. Greenfield, 58
Wyo. 13, 122 P.2d 850, 853.
It has been held that when the word person is used in a
legislative act, natural persons will be intended unless
something appear in the context to show that it applies to
artificial persons, Blair v. Worley, 1 Scam., Ill., 178; Ap-
peal of Fox, 112 Pa. 337 ; 4 A. 149 ; but as a rule corpora-
tions will be considered persons within the statutes unless
the intention of the legislature is manifestly to exclude
them. Stribbling v. Bank, 5 Rand., Va., 132.
A county is a person in a legal sense, Lancaster Co. v.
Trimble, 34 Neb. 752, 52 N.W. 711; but a sovereign is not;
In re Fox, 52 N.Y. 535, 11 Am.Rep. 751; U. S. v. Fox, 94
U.S. 315, 24 L.Ed. 192, but contra within the meaning of a
statute, providing a penalty for 'the fraudulent alteration of
a public record with intent that any "person" be de-
frauded, Martin v. State, 24 Tex. 61; and within the
meaning of a covenant for quiet and peaceful possession
against all and every person or persons; Giddings v.
Holter, 19 Mont. 263, 48 P. 8. An Indian is a person, U.
S. v. Crook, 5 Dill. 459, Fed.Cas.No.14,891; and a slave was
so considered, in so far, as to be capable of committing a
riot .in conjunction with white men, State v. Thackam, 1
Bay, S.C., 358. The estate of a decedent is a person, Bill-
ings v. State, 107 Ind. 54, 6 N.E. 914, 7 N.E. 763, 57 Am.
Rep. 77; and where the statute makes the owner of a dog
liable for injuries to any person, it includes the property
of such person, Brewer v. Crosby, 11 Gray, Mass., 29; but
where the statute provided damages for the bite of a dog
which had previously bitten a person, it was held insuffi-
cient to show that the dog had previously bitten a goat,
[1896] 2 Q.B. 109; a dog will not be included in the word
in an act which authorizes a person to kill dogs running
at large, Heisrodt v. Hackett, 34 Mich. 283, 22 Am.Rep. 529.
Where the statute prohibited any person from pursuing
his usual vocation on the Lord's Day, it was held to apply
to a judge holding court. Bass v. Irvin, 49 Ga. 436.
A child en ventre sa mere is not a person. Dietrich v.
Northampton, 138 Mass. 14, 52 Am.Rep. 242; but an in-
fant is so considered; Madden v. Springfield, 131 Mass. 441.
In the United States bankrupty act of 1898, it is provided
that the word "persons" shall include corporations, except
where otherwise specified, and officers, partnerships, and
women, and, when used with reference to the commission
of acts which are therein forbidden, shall include persons
who are participants in the forbidden acts, and the agents,
officers, and members of the board of directors or trustees,
or their controlling bodies, of corporations. 11 U.S.C.A.
§ 1.
Persons are the subject of rights and duties; and, as a
subject of a right, the person is the object of the correla-
tive duty, and conversely. The subject of a right has been
called by Professor Holland, the person of inherence ; the
subject of a duty, the person of incidence. "Entitled" and
"bound" are the terms in common use in English and for
most purposes they are adequate. Every full citizen is a
person; other human beings, namely, subjects who are
not citizens, may be persons. But not every human being
is necessarily a person, for a person is capable of rights
and duties, and there may well be human beings having no
legal rights, as was the case with slaves in English law.
• • *
A person is such, not because he is human, but because
rights and duties are ascribed to him. The person is the
are attributes. An individual human being considered as
having such attributes is what lawyers call a natural per-
son. Pollock, First Book of Jurispr. 110. Gray, Nature
and Sources of Law, ch. IL
PERSONA. Lat.
In the civil law. Character, in virtue of which

ant. Mackeld.Rom.Law, § 129.
In Ecclesiastical Law. The rector of a church
instituted and inducted, for his own life, was
called "persona mortalis;" and any collegiate or
conventual body, to whom the church was forever
appropriated, was termed "persona immortalis."
Jacob.

ought to be drawn from it.

## PETITION

A written address, embodying an ap-
plication or prayer from the person or persons
preferring it, to the power, body, or person to
whom it is presented, for the exercise of his or
their authority in the redress of some wrong, or
the grant of some favor, privilege, or license.
Enderson v. Hildenbrand, 52 N.D. 533, 204 N.W.
356; Benton Coal Mining Co. v. Industrial Com-
mission, 321 Ill. 208, 151 N.E. 520, 522; In re L.

parte, or where there are no parties in opposition,
praying for the exercise of the judicial powers of
the court in relation to some matter which is not
the subject for a suit or action, or for authority
to do some act which requires the sanction of the
court; as for the appointment of a guardian, for
leave to sell trust property, etc.
The word "petition" is generally used in judicial pro--
ceedings to describe an application in writing, in contra-
distinction to a motion, which may be viva voce. Bergen
v. Jones, 4 Metc., Mass., 371. The principal distinction
between motions and petitions lies in the fact that motions,
though usually made in writing, may sometimes be made-
orally, while a petition is always in writing. So, also,
motions can usually be made only by a party to the record,
while petitions may in some cases be presented by persons
not parties. Gibbs v. Ewing, 94 Fla. 236, 113 So. 730, 735.
In the practice of some of the states, the word "petition"
is adopted as the name of that initiatory pleading in an
action which is elsewhere called a "declaration" or "com-
plaint."
In equity practice. An application in writing
,es upon which it is founded; a proceeding resort-
ed to whenever the nature of the application to
the court requires a fuller statement than can be
conveniently made in a notice of motion. 1 Barb.
Ch.Pr. 578.

465, Fed.Cas.No.14,054.

one in the series of pleadings. More particularly,
the first pleading on the part of the defendant. In
the strictest sense, the answer which the defend•
ant in an action at law makes to the plaintiff's dec-
laration, and in which he sets up matter of fact
as defense, thus distinguished from a demurrer,
which interposes objections on grounds of law.
Equity. A special answer showing or relying
upon one or more things as a cause why the suit
should be either dismissed or delayed or barred.
Mitf.Eq.P1. 219; Coop.Eq.P1. 223.
A short statement, in response to a bill in
equity, of facts which, if inserted in the bill,
would render it demurrable; while an answer is
a complete statement of the defendant's case, and
contains answers to any interrogatories the plain-
tiff may have administered. Hunt, Eq. pt. 1, c. 3.
Old English Law
A suit or action.
Thus, the power to "hold pleas" is the power to take
cognizance of actions or suits; so "common pleas" are
actions or suits between private persons. And this mean-
ing of the word still appears in the modern declarations,
where it is stated, e. g., that the defendant "has been sum-
moned to answer the plaintiff in a plea of debt."
General
Affirmative plea. One which sets up a single
fact, not appearing in the bill, or sets up a num-
ber of circumstances all tending to establish a
single fact, which fact, if existing, destroys the
complainant's case. Potts v. Potts, N.J.Ch., 42
A. 1055.
Anomalous plea. One which is partly affirma-
tive and partly negative. Baldwin v. Elizabeth, 42
N.J.Eq. 11, 6 A. 275; Potts v, Potts, N.J.Ch., 42 A.
Bad plea. One which is unsound or insufficient
in form or substance, or which .does not technic-
ally answer or correspond with the pleading which
preceded it in the action.
Common pleas. Common causes or suits; civil
actions brought and prosecuted between subjects
or citizens, as distinguished from pleas of the
crown or criminal cases.
Counter-plea. A plea to some matter incidental
to the main object of the suit, and out of the direct
line of pleadings. In the more ancient system of
in effect, a replication to aid prayer, (q. v.;) that
is, where a tenant for life or other limited inter-
est in land, having an action brought against him
in respect to the title to such land, prayed in aid
of the lord or reversioner for his better defense,
that which the demandant alleged against either
request was called a "counter-plea." Cowell.
Dilatory pleas. See Dilatory.
Double plea. One having the technical fault of
duplicity; one consisting of several distinct and
independent matters alleged to the same point
and requiring different answers.
False plea. A sham plea; (which title see
infra.)
Foreign plea. A plea objecting to the jurisdic-
tion of a judge, on the ground that he had not cog-
nizance of the subject-matter of the suit. Cowell.
Negative plea. One which does not undertake
to answer the various allegations of the bill, but
specifically denies some particular fact or matter
the existence of which is essential to entitle the
complainant to any relief. Potts v. Potts, N.J.
Ch., 42 A. 1056.
Peremptory pleas. "Pleas in bar" are so termed
in contradistinction to that class of pleas called
"dilatory pleas." The former, viz., peremptory
pleas, are usually pleaded to the merits of the ac-
tion, with the view of raising a material issue be-
tween the parties; while the latter class, viz., dila-
tory pleas, are generally pleaded with a view of
retarding the plaintiff's proceedings, and not for
the purpose of raising an issue upon which the
parties may go to trial and settle the point in dis-
pute. Peremptory pleas are also called "pleas in
bar," while dilatory pleas are said to be in abate-
ment only. Brown.
Plea in abatement. In practice. A plea which,
without disputing justice of plaintiff's claim, ob-
jects to place, mode, or time of asserting it; it al-
lows plaintiff to renew suit in another place or
form, or at another time, and does not assume to
answer action on its merits, or deny existence of
particular cause of action on which plaintiff re-
lies. Dickenson v. Hawes, 32 Ga.App. 173, 122 S.E.
811, 812; Harris v. North, 78 W.Va. 76, 88 S.E.
603, 604, 1 A.L.R. 356; Hurst v. Everett, C.C.N.C.,
21 F. 221; Wilson v. Winchester & P. R. Co., C.C.
W.Va., 82 F. 18.
Plea in bar. In practice. A plea which goes
to bar the plaintiff's action; that is, to defeat it
absolutely and entirely. 1 Burrill, Pr. 162; 3 Bl.
Comm. 303; Rawson v. Knight, 71 Me. 102; Nor-
ton v. Winter, 1 Or. 48, 62 Am.Dec. 297; Wilson
v. Knox County, 132 Mo. 387, 34 S.W. 45.
Plea in discharge. One which admits that the
plaintiff had a cause of action, but shows that it
was discharged by some subsequent or collateral
matter, as, payment or accord and satisfaction.
Nichols v. Cecil, 106 Tenn. 455, 61 S.W. 768.
Plea in reconvention. In the civil law. A plea
which sets up new matter, not in defense to the
action, but by way of cross-complaint, set-off, or
counterclaim.
Plea of confession and avoidance. One which
admits that plaintiff had a cause of action, but
which avers that it has been discharged by some
subsequent or collateral matter. De Lissa v.
Fuller Coal and Mining Co., 59 Kan. 319, 52 P.
886, 888.
Plea of guilty. A confession of guilt in open
court. Griffin v. State, 12 Ga.App. 615, 77 S.E.
1080, 1084; Stokes v. State, 122 Ark. 56, 182 S.W.
521; Accardi v. U. S., C.C.A.Mo., 15 F.2d 619, 621.
Plea of nolo contendere. One which has the
same effect as a "plea of guilty" in so far as re-
gards the proceedings on the indictment, and it is
a confession only for the purposes of the criminal
prosecution and does not bind the defendant in a
civil suit for the same wrong. Schireson v. State
Board of Medical Examiners of New Jersey, 129
N.J.L. 203, 28 A.2d 879, 881. See, also, Nolo Con-
tendere.
Plea of release. One which admits the cause
of action, but sets forth a release subsequently
executed by the party authorized to release the
claim. Landis v. Morrissey, 69 Cal. 83, 10 P. 258.
Plea side. The plea side of a court is that
branch or department of the court which enter-
tains or takes cognizance of civil actions and
suits, as distinguished from its criminal or crown
department. Thus the court of king's bench is
said to have a plea side and a crown or criminal
side; the one branch or department of it being de-
voted to the cognizance of civil actions, the other
to criminal proceedings and matters peculiarly
concerning the crown. So the court of exchequer
is said to have a plea side and a crown side; the
one being appropriated to civil actions, the other
to matters of revenue. Brown.
Pleas in short by consent. Pleas which are in-
tended to be nothing more than a mere outline,
or sketch of the defense they respectively set up.
Steele v. Walker, 115 Ala. 485, 21 So. 942, 943, 67
Am.St.Rep. 62.
Pleas of the crown. In English law. A phrase
now employed to signify criminal causes, in which
the king is a party. Formerly it signified royal
causes for offenses of a greater magnitude than
mere misdemeanors.
Pleas roll. In English practice. A record upon
which are entered all the pleadings in a cause,
in their regular order, and the issue.
Pure plea. One which relies wholly on some
matter outside those referred to in the bill; as
a plea of a release on a settled account.
Pleas not pure are so called in contradistinction to pure
pleas; they are sometimes also denominated negative
pleas. 4 Bouvier, Inst. n. 4275.
Sham plea. A false plea; a plea of false or
fictitious matter, subtly drawn so as to entrap
A vexatious or false defense, resorted to under
the old system of pleading for purposes of delay
and annoyance. Steph.P1. 383.
Mr. Chitty defines sham pleas to be pleas so palpably
and manifestly untrue that the court will assume them to
be so ; pleas manifestly absurd. When answers or defenses
admit of lawyer-like argument, such as courts should listen
to, they are not "sham," in the sense of the statute. When
it needs argument to prove that an answer or demurrer is
frivolous, it is not frivolous, and should not be stricken
off. To warrant this summary mode of disposing of a
defense, the mere reading ,of the pleadings should be suffi-
cient to disclose, without deliberation and without a doubt,
that the defense is sham or irrelevant. Cottrill v. Cramer,
40 Wis. 559. A "sham plea" is one good on its face, but
false in fact. In re Beam, 93 N.J.Eq. 593, 117 A. 613, 614.
At common law a plea was considered sham when it was
palpably or inherently false, and from the plain or con-
ceded facts in the case must have been known to the party
interposing it to be false. Fidelity Mut. Life Ins. Co. v.
Wilkes Barre & H. R. Co., 98 N.J.Law, 507, 120 A. 734,
Special plea. A special kind of plea in 'bar, dis-
tinguished by this name from the general issue,
and consisting usually of some new affirmative
matter, though it may also be in the form of a
traverse or denial. Steph.P1. 52, 162; Allen v.
New Haven & N. Co., 49 Conn. 245.
Special plea in bar. One which advances new
matter. It differs from the general, in this; that
the latter denies some material allegation, but
never advances new matter. Gould, Pl. c. 2, § 38.

## PLEAD

To make, deliver, or file any pleading;
to conduct the pleadings in a cause. To interpose
any pleading in a suit which contains allegations
of fact; in this sense the word is the antithesis
of "demur." More particularly, to deliver in a
formal manner the defendant's answer to the
plaintiff's declaration, or to the indictment, as the
case may be.
To appear as a pleader or advocate in a cause;
to argue a cause in a court of justice. But this
meaning of the word is not technical, but col-
loquial.

## PLEAD A STATUTE

Pleading a statute is stat-
ing the facts which bring the case within it; and
"counting" on it, in the strict language of plead-
ing, is making express reference to it by apt terms
to show the source of right relied on. McCullough
v. Colfax County, 4 Neb. (Unof.) 543, 95 N.W. 31.

## PLEAD ISSUABLY

This means to interpose
such a plea as is calculated to raise a material
issue, either of law or of fact.

## PLEAD OVER

To pass over, or omit to notice,
a material allegation in the last pleading of the
opposite party; to pass by a defect in the plead-
ing of the other party without taking advantage
of it. In another sense, to plead the general is-
sue, after one has interposed a demurrer or spe-
cial plea which has been dismissed by a judgment
of respondeat ouster,
PLEAD TO THE MERITS. This is a phrase of
long standing and accepted usage in the law, and
distinguishes those pleas which answer the cause
pleas of a different character. Rahn v. Gunnison,
12 Wis. 529.

## PLEADED

Alleged or averred, in form, in a
judicial proceeding.
It more often refers to matter of defense, but
not invariably. To say that matter in a declara-
tion or replication is not well pleaded would not
be deemed erroneous. Abbott.

## PLEADER

A person whose business it Is to
draw pleadings. Formerly, when pleading at
common law was a highly technical and difficult
art, there was a class of men known as "special
pleaders not at the bar," who held a position in-
termediate between counsel and attorneys. The
class is now almost extinct, and the term "plead-
ers" is generally applied, in England, to junior
members of the common-law bar. Sweet.
Special pleader. In English practice. A person
whose professional occupation is to give verbal
or written opinions upon statements made ver-
bally or in writing, and to draw pleadings, civil
or criminal, and such practical proceedings as may
be out of the usual course. 2 Chit.Pr. 42.
Special pleaders were not necessarily at the bar; but
those that were not required to take out annual certificates
under 33 & 34 Vict. c. 97, §§ 60, 63; Moz. & W.

## PLEADING

The peculiar science or system of
rules and principles, established in the common
law, according to which the pleadings or respon-
sive allegations of litigating parties are framed,
with a view to preserve technical propriety and
to produce a proper issue.
The process performed by the parties to a suit
or action, in alternately presenting written state-
ments of their contention, each responsive to that
which precedes, and each serving to narrow the
field of controversy, until there evolves a single
point, affirmed on one side and denied on the
other, called the "issue," upon which they then
go to trial.
The act or step of interposing any one of the
pleadings in a cause, but particularly one on the
part of the defendant; and, in the strictest sense,
one which sets up allegations of fact in defense
to the action.
The name "a pleading" is also given to any one of the
formal written statements of accusation or defense pre-
sented by the parties alternately in an action at law; the
aggregate of such statements filed in any one cause' are
termed "the pleadings."
The oral advocacy of a client's cause in court,
by his barrister or counsel, is sometimes called
"pleading;" but this is a popular, rather than
technical, use.
Chancery Practice
It consists in making the formal written allega-
tions or statements of the respective parties on
the record to maintain the suit, or to defeat it,
of which, when contested in matters of fact, they
propose to offer proofs, and in matters of law to
offer arguments to the court. Story, Eq.P1. § 4,
note.
Articulated pleading. The stating In separate
paragraphs, r separately numbered, of each ma-
terial fact of the petition. Newspaper Feature
Service v. Southern Pub. Co., 140 La. 702, 73 So.
Double pleading. This is not allowed either
in the declaration or subsequent pleadings. Its
meaning with respect to the former is that the
declaration must not, in support of a single de-
mand, allege several distinct matters, by any one
of which that demand is sufficiently supported.
With respect to the subsequent pleadings, the
meaning is that none of them is to contain sev-
eral distinct answers to that which preceded it;
and the reason of the rule in each case is that
such pleading tends to several issues in respect
of a single claim. Wharton.
Special pleading. When the allegations (or
"pleadings," as they are called) of the contending
parties in an action are not of the general or ordi-
nary form, but are of a more complex or special
character, they are denominated "special plead-
ings;" and, when a defendant pleads a plea of
this description, (i. e., a special plea,) he is said
to plead specially, in opposition to pleading the
general issue. These terms have given rise to
the popular denomination of that science which,
though properly called "pleading," is generally
known by the name of "special pleading." Brown.
The allegation of special or new matter in opposi-
tion or explanation of the last previous averments
on the other side, as distinguished from a direct
denial of matter previously alleged by the oppo-
site party. Gould, Pl. c. 1, § 18; Gelston v. Hoyt,
3 Wheat. 246, 4 L.Ed. 381; Com.Dig. Pleader (E
15) ; Steph.Pl., And. ed. 240, n. In popular lan-
guage, the adroit and plausible advocacy of a
client's case in court. Stimson, Law Gloss.

## PLEADINGS

The formal allegations by the
parties of their respective claims and defenses, for
the judgment of the court. Smith v. Jacksonville
Oil Mill Co., 21 Ga.App. 679, 94 S.E. 900, 901; Wil-
kinson v. Stone, 82 Okl. 296, 200 P. 196, 199; Tread-
gold v. Willard, 81 Or. 658, 160 P. 803, 805.
The individual allegations of the respective par-
ties to an action at common law, proceeding from
them alternately, in the order and under the dis-
tinctive names following: The plaintiff's declara-
tion, the defendant's plea, the plaintiff's replica-
tion, the defendant's rejoinder, the plaintiff's sur-
re joinder, the defendant's rebutter, the plaintiff's
surrebutter; after which they have no distinctive
names. Burrill.
The term "pleadings" has a technical and well-defined
meaning. Pleadings are written allegations of what is
affirmed on the one side, or denied on the other, disclosing
to the court or jury having 'to try the cause the real mat-
ter in dispute between the parties. Desnoyer v. Hereux, 1
Minn. 17 (Gil. 1).

## PLEBANUS

In old English ecclesiastical law.
A rural dean. Cowell.

## PLEBEIAN

mon people, as distinguished from the nobles.
er sort of people; the plebeians.

White, New Recop. b. 1, tit. 5, c. 3, § 6, and note.

## PLEBIANA

In old records. A mother church.

## PLEBISCITE

In modern constitutional law, the
name "plebiscite" has been given to a vote of the
entire people, (that is, the aggregate of the en-
franchised individuals composing a state or na-
tion,) expressing their choice for or against a
proposed law or enactment, submitted to them,
and which, if adopted, will work a radical change
in the constitution, or which is beyond the pow-
ers of the regular legislative body. The proceed-
ing is extraordinary, and is generally revolution-
ary in its character; an example of which may
be seen in the plebiscites submitted to the French
people by Louis Napoleon, whereby the Second
Empire was established. But the principle of
the plebiscite has been incorporated in the mod-
ern Swiss constitution, (under the name of "re-
ferendum,") by which a revision of the constitu-
tion must be undertaken when demanded by the
vote of fifty thousand Swiss citizens. Maine Pop-
ular Govt. 40, 96.

## PLEBISCITUM

Lat. In Roman law. A law
enacted by the plebs or commonalty, (that is, the
citizens, with the exception of the patricians and
senators,) at the request or on the proposition of
a plebeian magistrate, such as a "tribune." Inst.
1, 2, 4.

## PLEBS

Lat. In Roman law. The commonalty
or citizens, exclusive of the patricians and sena-
tors. Inst. 1, 2, 4.

## PLEDABLE

L. Fr. That may be brought or
conducted; as an action or "plea," as it was
formerly called. Britt. c. 32.

## PLEDGE

In the law of bailment. A bailment
of goods to a creditor as security for some debt
or engagement. A bailment or delivery of goods
by a debtor to his creditor, to be kept till the
debt be discharged. Story, Bailm. § 7; Civ. Code
La. art. 3133; 2 Kent, Comm. 577; Stearns v.
Marsh, 4 Denio, N.Y., 229, 47 Am.Dec. 248; Sheri-
dan v. Presas, 18 Misc. 180, 41 N.Y.S. 451; Bank
of Rochester v. Jones, 4 N.Y. 507, 55 Am.Dec. 290;
Gloucester Bank v. Worcester, 10 Pick., Mass., 531;
Lilienthal v. Ballou, 125 Cal. 183, 57 P. 897.
The necessary elements to constitute a contract
one of "pledge" are: Possession of the pledged
property must pass from the pledgor to the pled-
gee; the legal title to the property must remain
in the pledgor; and the pledgee must have a
lien on the property for the payment of a debt or
the performance of an obligation due him by the
pledgor or some other person—while, in a "chat-
tel mortgage," the legal title passes to the mort-
gagee subject to a defeasance. Rice v. Garnett,
17 Ala.App. 239, 84 So. 557, 558; Campbell v. Red-
wine Bros., 22 Ga.App. 455, 96 S.E. 347; Sneeden
v. Nurnberger's Market, 192 N.C. 439, 135 S.E.
328, 330; McAndrews v. Idawa Gold Mining Co.,
54 N.D. 734, 210 N.W. 514, 519, 51 A.L.R. 1123.
A bailment of personal property as security
for a debt or other obligation. Thoen v. First
Nat. Bank, 199 Minn. 47, 271 N.W. 111, 112;
Travers v. Stevens, 108 Fla. 11, 145 So. 851, 854.
The specific article delivered to the creditor
in security is also called a "pledge" or "pawn."
There is a clear distinction between mortgages and
pledges. In a pledge the legal title remains in the pledgor ;
in a mortgage it passes to the mortgagee. In a mortgage
the mortgagee need not have possession; in a pledge the
pledgee must have possession, though it be only construc-
tive. In a mortgage, at common law, the property on non-
payment of the debt passes wholly to the mortgagee; in a
pledge the property is sold, and only so much of the pro-
ceeds as will pay his debt passes to the pledgee. A mort-
gage is a conditional conveyance of property, which be-
comes absolute unless redeemed at a specified time. A
pledge is not strictly a conveyance at all, nor need any day
of redemption be appointed for it. A mortgagee can sell
and deliver the thing mortgaged, subject only to the right
of redemption. A pledgee cannot sell and deliver his pawn
until the debt is due and payment denied. Bouvier.
There are two varieties of the contract of pledge known
to the law of Louisiana, viz., pawn and antichresis ; the
former relating to chattel securities, the latter to landed
securities. Civ.Code La. art. 3134; and see those titles.

## PLEDGEE

The party to whom goods are pledg-
ed, or delivered in pledge. Story, Bailm. § 287.

## PLEDGERY

Suretyship, or an undertaking or
answering for another. Gloucester Bank v. Wor-
cester, 10 Pick. Mass., 531.
;

## PLEDGES

In pleading. Those persons who be-
came sureties for the prosecution of the suit.
Their names were anciently appended at the
foot of the declaration. In time it became purely
a formal matter, because the plaintiff was no
longer liable to be amerced for a false claim, and
the fictitious persons John Doe and Richard Roe
became the universal pledges, or they might be
omitted altogether, 1 Tidd, Pr. 455; Archb. Civ. Pl.
171; or inserted at any time before judgment;
they are now omitted.

## PLEDGES TO RESTORE

In England, before
the plaintiff in foreign attachment can issue exe-
cution against the property in the hands of the
garnishee, he must find "pledges to restore," con-
sisting of two householders, who enter into a re-
cognizance for the restoration of the property, as
a security for the protection of the defendant;
for, as the plaintiff's debt is not proved in any
stage of the proceedings, the court guards the
rights of the absent defendant by taking security
on his behalf, so that if he should afterwards dis-
prove the plaintiff's claim he may obtain restitu-
tion of the property attached. Brand. For. At-
tachm. 93; Sweet.

## PLEDGOR

The party delivering goods in pledge;
the party pledging. Story, Bailm. § 287.

## PLEGIABILIS

In old English law. That may
be pledged; the subject of pledge or security.
Fleta, lib. 1, c. 20, § 98.

## PLEGII DE PROSEQUENDO

## PLENARY CONFESSION

A full and complete
confession. An admission dr confession, whether
in civil or criminal law, is said to be "plenary"
when it is, if believed, conclusive against the per-
son making it. Best, Ev. 664; Rosc. Crim. Ev. 39.

## PLENARY SUIT

One that proceeds on formal
pleadings. Central Republic Bank and Trust Co.
v. Caldwell, C.C.A.Mo., 58 F.2d 721.
In the ecclesiastical courts, (and in admiralty practice,)
causes are divided into plenary and summary. The former
are those in whose proceedings the order and solemnity of
the law is required to be exactly observed, so that if there
is the least departure from that order, or disregard of that
solemnity, the whole proceedings are annulled. Summary
causes are those in which it is unnecessary to pursue that
order and solemnity. Brown.

A kind of earnest used in pub-
lic sales at Amsterdam. Wharton.

## PLOTTAGE

A term used in appraising land
values and particularly in eminent domain pro-
ceedings, to designate the additional value given

ber of votes has a plurality, but he has not a
majority unless he receives a greater number of
votes than those cast for all his competitors com-
bined, or, in other words, more than one-half of
the total number of votes cast.
In ecclesiastical law, "plurality" means the
holding two, three, or more benefices by the same
incumbent; and he is called a "pluralist." Plural-
ities are now abolished, except in certain cases.

## PLUS PETITIO

In Roman law. A phrase de-

just in one's pleadings. This more might be
claimed in four different respects, viz.: (1) Re,
i. e., in amount, (e. g., £50 for £5;) (2) loco, i. e.,
in place (e. g., delivery at some place more diffi-
cult to effect than the place specified;) (3) tern-
pore, i. e., in time, (e. g., claiming payment on the
1st of August of what is not due till the 1st of
September;) and (4) causa, e., in quality, (e. g.,
claiming a dozen of champagne, when the con-
tract was only for a dozen of wine generally.)
Prior to Justinian's time, this offense was in gen-
eral fatal to the action; but, under the legislation
of the emperors Zeno and Justinian, the offense
(if re, loco, or causa) exposed the party to the
payment of three times the damage, if any, sus-
tained by the other side, and (if ternpore) obliged
him to postpone his action for double the time,
and to pay the costs of his first action before com-
mencing a second. Brown.

pears, the goods themselves are delivered.
Poinding of stray cattle, committing depreda-
tions on corn, grass, or plantations, until satis-

## POINT RESERVED

When, in the progress of
the trial of a cause, an important or difficult point
of law is presented to the court, and the court is
not certain of the decision that should be given,
it may reserve the point, that is, decide it pro-
visionally as it is asked by the party, but reserve
its more mature consideration for the hearing
on a motion for a new trial, when, if it shall ap-
pear that the first ruling was wrong, the verdict
will be set aside. The point thus treated is tech-
nically called a "point reserved."
POINTS. The distinct propositions of law, or
chief heads of argument, presented by a party

ment of the cause. Also the marks used in punc-

## POLICE

The function of that branch of the

is charged with the preservation of public order
and tranquillity, the promotion of the public
health, safety, and morals, and the prevention, de-
59 Conn. 50, 21 A. 1024, 10 L.R.A. 83; People v.
Squire, 107 N.Y. 593, 14 N.E. 820, 1 Am.St.Rep.
The police of a state, in a comprehensive sense, em-
braces its whole system of internal regulation, by which
the state seeks not only to preserve the public order and to
prevent offenses against the state, but also to establish for
the intercourse of citizen with citizen those rules of good
manners and good neighborhood which are calculated to
prevent a conflict of rights, and to insure to each the unin-
terrupted enjoyment of his own, so far as is reasonably
consistent with a like enjoyment of rights by others.
Cooley, Const.Lim. *572. It is defined by Jeremy Bentham
in his works: "Police is in general a system of precau-
tion, either for the prevention of crime or of calamities.
Its business may be distributed into eight distinct branch-
es; (1) police for the prevention of offenses; (2) police
for the prevention of calamities; (3) police for the preven-
tion of epidemic diseases; (4) police of charity; (5) police
of interior communications; (6) police of public amuse-
ments; (7) police for recent intelligence; (8) police for
registration." Canal Com'rs v. Willamette Transp. Co., 6
Or. 222.
The term "police" has also been divided into "adminis-
trative police", which has for its object to maintain con-
stantly public order in every part of the general adminis-
tration, and "judiciary police" which is intended princi-
pally to prevent crimes by punishing the criminals. Its
object is to punish crimes which the administrative police
has not been able to prevent. Green v. City of Bennetts-
ville, 197 S.C. 313, 15 S.E.2d 334, 337.

## POLICE COURT

ior court in several of the states, which has a
summary jurisdiction over minor offenses and
misdemeanors of small consequence, and the pow-
ers of a committing magistrate in respect to
more serious crimes, and, in some states, a limited
jurisdiction for the trial of civil causes. In Eng-
lish law. Courts in which stipendiary magis-
trates, chosen from barristers of a certain stand-
ing, sit for the dispatch of business. Their gen-
eral duties and powers are the same as those of
the unpaid magistracy, except that one of them
may usually act in cases which would require to
be heard before two other justices. Wharton.

## POLICE DE CHARGEMENT

Fr. In French
law. A bill of lading. Ord. Mar. liv. 3, tit. 2.

## POLICE JURY

In Louisiana. The governing
bodies of the "parishes," which are political sub-
divisions of the state, comparable to counties in
other states. National Liberty Ins. Co. of Ameri-
ca v. Police Jury of Natchitoches Parish, 'C.C.A.
La., 96 F.2d 261, 262.

## POLICE JUSTICE

A magistrate charged exclu-
sively with the duties incident to the common-law
office of a conservator or justice of the peace;
the prefix "police" serving merely to distinguish
them from justices having also civil jurisdiction.
Wenzler v. People, 58 N.Y. 530.

## POLICE MAGISTRATE

An inferior judicial of-
ficer having jurisdiction of minor criminal of-
fenses, breaches of police regulations, and the
like; so called to distinguish them from magis-
trates who have jurisdiction in civil cases also,
as justices of the peace. People v. Curley, 5 Colo.
416; McDermont v. Dinnie, 6 N.D. 278, 69 N.W.

## POLICE OFFICER

One of the staff of men em-
ployed in cities and towns to enforce the muni-
cipal police, i. e., the laws and ordinances for
preserving the peace and good order of the com-
munity. Otherwise called "policeman."
POLICE POWER. The power vested in a state
to establish laws and ordinances for the regula-
tion and enforcement of its police as above de-
fined. The power vested in the legislature to
make, ordain, and establish all manner of whole-
some and reasonable laws, statutes, and ordi-
nances, either with penalties or without, not re-
pugnant to the constitution, as they shall judge
to be for the good and welfare of the common-
wealth, and of the subjects of the same. Corn. v.
Alger, 7 Cush. (Mass.) 85. An authority con-
ferred by the American constitutional system up-
on the individual states, through which they are
enabled to establish a special department of po-
lice; adopt such regulations as tend to prevent
the commission of fraud, violence, or other offens-
es against the state; aid in the arrest of crim-
inals; and secure generally the comfort, health,
and prosperity of the state, by preserving the
public order, preventing a conflict of rights in the
common intercourse of the citizens, and insuring
to each an uninterrupted enjoyment of all the
privileges conferred upon him by the laws of his
country. Lalor, Pol. Enc. s. v.
That inherent and plenary power in state over persons
and property which enables the people to prohibit all
things inimical to comfort, safety, health, and welfare of
society. Drysdale v. Prudden, 195 N.C. 722, 143 S.E. 530,
It is true that the legislation which secures to all pro-
tection in their rights, and the equal use and enjoyment of
their property, embraces an almost infinite variety of sub-
jects. Whatever affects the peace, good order, morals,
and health of the community comes within its scope; and
every one must use and enjoy his property subject to the
restrictions which such legislation imposes. What is
termed the "police power" of the state, which, from the
language often used respecting it, one would suppose to be
an undefined and irresponsible element in government, can
only interfere with the conduct of individuals in their in-
tercourse with each other, and in the use of their property,
so far as may be required to secure these objects. Munn
v. Illinois, 94 U.S. 145, 24 L.Ed. 77. For other definitions,
see Slaughterhouse Cases, 16 Wall. 62, 21 L.Ed. 394; Stone

land & B. R. Co., 27 Vt. 140, 62 Am.Dec. 625; People v.
Steele, 231 Ill. 340, 83 N.E. 236, 14 L.R.A.,N.S., 361, 121
Am.St.Rep. 321; In re Clark, 65 Conn. 17, 31 A. 522, 28
L.R.A. 242; Mathews v. Board of Education, 127 Mich. 530,
86 N.W. 1036, 54 L.R.A. 736; In re Main, 162 Okl. 65, 19
P.2d 153, 156.

## POLICE REGULATIONS

Laws of a state, or
ordinances of a municipality, which have for their
object the preservation and protection of public
peace and good order, and of the health, morals,
and security of the people. Ex parte Bourgeois,

137 Cal. 583, 70 P. 674; Roanoke Gas Co. v.
Roanoke, 88 Va. 810, 14 S.E. 665.

## POLICE SUPERVISION

to police supervision is where a criminal offender
is subjected to the obligation of notifying the
place of his residence and every change of his
residence to the chief officer of police of the dis-
trict, and of reporting himself once a month to
the chief officer or his substitute. Offenders sub-
ject to police supervision are popularly called
"habitual criminals." Sweet.

## POLICIES OF INSURANCE, COURT OF

## POLICY

The general principles by which a gov-
ernment is guided in its management of public
affairs, or the legislature in its measures.
This term, as applied to a law, ordinance, or
rule of law, denotes its general purpose or tend-
ency considered as directed to the welfare or
prosperity of the state or community.
In gaming. A species of "lottery" whereby the
chance is determined by numbers; "numbers
game" also being a lottery. People v. Hines, 258
App.Div. 466, 17 N.Y.S.2d 141, 142.
Policy of a statute, or legislature. As applied
to a penal or prohibitive statute, means -the in-
tention of discouraging conduct of a mischievous
tendency. See L.R. 6 P.C. 134; 5 Barn. & Ald.
335; Pol. Cont. 235.
Policy of the law. By this phrase is under-
stood the disposition of the law to discountenance
certain classes of acts, transactions, or agree-
ments, or to refuse them its sanction, because it
considers them immoral, detrimental to the pub-
lic welfare, subversive of good order, or other-
wise contrary to the plan and purpose of civil
regulations.
Public policy. That principle of the law which
holds that no subject can lawfully do that which
has a tendency to be injurious to the public or
against the public good. 4 H. L. Cas. 1; Greenh.

dom of contract or private dealings is restricted
by law for the good of the community. Wharton.
The term "policy," as applied to a statute, regu-
lation, rule of law, course of action, or the like,
refers to its probable effect, tendency, or object,
considered with reference to the social or politi-
cal well-being of the state. Thus, certain classes
of acts are said to be "against public policy,"
when the law refuses to enforce or recognize
them, on the ground that they have a mischievous
tendency, so as to be injurious to the interests of
the state, apart from illegality or immorality.

"Public policy" is the community common sense and
common conscience extended and applied throughout the
state to matters of public morals, public health, public
safety, public welfare, and the like; it is that general and
well-settled public opinion relating to man's plain, palpable
duty to his fellow men having due regard to all the cir-
cumstances of each particular relation and situation. Pitts-
burgh, C., C. & St. L. Ry. Co. v. Kinney, 95 Ohio St. 64,

The term "specific" as applied in insurance phraseology

## POSITIVE LAW

Law actually and specifically
enacted or adopted by proper authority for the
government of an organized jural society.
"A 'law,' in the sense in which that term is employed in
jurisprudence, is enforced by a sovereign political author-
ity. It is thus distinguished not only from all rules which,
like the principles of morality and the so-called laws of
honor and of fashion, are enforced by an indeterminate
authority, but also from all rules enforced by a determi-
nate authority which is either, on the one hand, super-

and enjoyment of a termor, or a person having a
term, who is said to be possessed, and not seised.
Bac.Tr. 335; Poph. 76; Dyer, 369.
"Possessed" is a variable term in the law, and has dif-
ferent meanings as it is used in different circumstances. It
sometimes implies a temporary interest in lands; as we
say a man is possessed, in contradistinction to being seised.
It sometimes implies the corporal having; as we say a man
is seised and possessed. But it sometimes implies no more
than that one has a property in a thing; that he has it as
owner; that it is his. Thompson v. Moran, 44 Mich. 603,
7 N.W. 180; In re Dillingham's Estate, 196 Cal. 525, 238

## POSSESSIO

Lat.
Civil Law
That condition of fact under which one can
exercise his power over a corporeal thing at his
pleasure, to the exclusion of all others. This con-
dition of fact is called "detention," and it forms
the substance of possession in all its varieties.
Mackeld. Rom. Law, § 238.
"Possession," in the sense of "detention," is the actual
exercise of such a power as the owner has a right to exer-
cise. The term "possessio" occurs in the Roman jurists
in various senses. There is possessio simply, and possessio
civilis, and possessio naturalis. Possessio denoted, orig-
inally, bare detention. But this detention, under certain
conditions, becomes a legal state, inasmuch as it leads to
ownership, through usucapio. Accordingly, the word "pos-
sessio," which required no qualification so long as there
was no other notion attached to possessio, requires such
qualification when detention becomes a legal state. This
detention, then, when it has the conditions necessary to
usucapio, is called "possessio civilis;" and all other pos-
sessio as opposed to civilis is naturalis. Sandars, Just.Inst.
274. Wharton.
Old English law. Possession; seisin. The de-
tention of a corporeal thing by means of a physi-
cal act and mental intent, aided by some support
of right. Bract. fol. 38b.
General
Pedis possessio. A foothold; an actual posses-
sion of real property, implying either actual oc-
cupancy or enclosure and use. Lawrence v. Ful-
ton, 19 Cal. 690; Porter v. Kennedy, 1 McMul.,
S.C., 357.
Possessio bona fide. Possession in good faith.
possessor bona fide is one who believes that no
other person has a better right to the possession
than himself. A possessor mala fide is one who
knows that he is not entitled to the possession.
Mackeld. Rom. Law, § 243.
Possessio bonorum. In the civil law. The pos-
session of goods. More commonly termed "bono-
rum possessio." (q. v.).
Possessio civilis. In Roman law. A legal pos-
session, i. e., a possessing accompanied with the
intention to be or to thereby become owner; and,
as so understood, it was distinguished from "pos-
sessio naturalis," otherwise called "nuda deten-
tio," which was a possessing without any such.
intention. Possessio civilis was the basis of usuca-
pio or of longi temporis possessio, and was usual-
ly (but not necessarily) adverse possession.
Brown.
Possessio fratris. The possession or seisin of
a brother; that is, such possession of an estate
by a brother as would entitle his sister of the
whole blood to succeed him as heir, to the exclu-
sion of a half-brother. Hence, derivatively, that
doctrine of the older English law of descent which
shut out the half-blood from the succession to
estates; a doctrine which was abolished by the de-
scent act, 3 & 4 Wm. IV. c. 106. 1 Steph.Comm.
385; Broom, Max. 532.
Possessio longi temporis. See Usucapio.
Possessio naturalis. See Possessio Civilis.

## POSSESSION

The detention and control, or the
manual or ideal custody, of anything which may
be the subject of property, for one's use and en-
joyment, either as owner as the proprietor
of a qualified right in it, and either held personally
or by another who exercises it in one's place and
name. Act or state of possessing. That condition
of facts under which one can exercise his power
over a corporeal thing at his pleasure to the ex-
clusion of all other persons. Starits v. Avery,
204 Iowa 401, 213 N.W. 769, 771; Schenk v. State,

Compton, Mo.App., 297 S.W. 413, 414; Nevin v.
Louisville Trust Co., 258 Ky. 187, 79 S.W.2d 688,
In the older books, "possession" is sometimes used as
the synonym of "seisin;" but, strictly speaking, they are
entirely different terms. "The difference between posses-
sion and seisin is : Lessee for years is possessed, and yet
the lessor is still seised; and therefore the terms of law
ments, gifts in tail, and leases for life he is described as
'seised.' " Noy. Max. 64.
"Possession" is used in some of the books in the sense
of property. "A possession is an hereditament or chattel."
Finch, Law, b. 2, c. 3.

State, 130 Miss. 673, 95 So. 64; State v. McAllister, 187
N.C. 400, 121 S.E. 739, 740; People v. Leslie, 239 Mich. 334,
214 N.W. 128.
Actual possession. Exists where the thing
is in the immediate occupancy of the party. Simp-
son v. Blount, 14 N.C. 34; Field Furniture Co. v.
Community Loan Co., 257 Ky. 825, 79 S.W.2d 211,
Adverse possession. The actual, open, and no-
torious possession and enjoyment of real proper:
ty, or of any estate lying in grant, continued for
a certain length of time, held adversely and in de-
nial and opposition to the title of another claim-
ant, or under circumstances which indicate an as-
sertion or color of right or title on the part of the
person maintaining it, as against another person
who is out of possession. Hall v. Lavat, 301 Mo.
675, 257 S.W. 108, 111; W. T. Carter & Bro. v.
Richardson, Tex.Civ.App., 225 S.W. 816, 817; Bax-

166 N.W. 910, 912.
Chose in possession. A thing (subject of per-
sonal property) in actual possession, as distin-
guished from a "chose in action," which is not
presently in the owner's possession, but which he
has a right to demand, receive, or recover by suit.
Civil possession. In modern civil law and in
the law of Louisiana, that possession which exists
when a person ceases to reside in a house or on
the land which he occupied, or to detain the
movable which he possessed, but without intend-
ing to abandon the possession. It is the detention
of a thing by virtue of a just title and under the
conviction of possessing as owner. Civ.Code La.
art. 3429 et seq. A fiction resulting from the reg-
istry of the title of the original owner. Baldwin
Lumber Co. v. Dalferes, 138 La. 507, 70 So. 493,

500, 501.
Constructive possession. Possession not actual
but assumed to exist, where one claims to hold

regularly laid out, is in possession of a part, he is
constructively in possession of the whole. Flem-
ing v. Maddox, 30 Iowa 241.
Corporeal possession. The continuing exercise
of a claim to the exclusive use of a material thing.
The elements of this possession are first, the men-
tal attitude of the claimant, the intent to possess,
to appropriate to oneself; and second, the ef-
fective realization of this attitude. All the au-
thorities agree that an intent to exclude others
must coexist with the external facts, and must be
fulfilled in the external physical facts in order
to constitute possession. State v. Wagoner, 123
Kan. 591, 256 P. 957, 958.
Derivative possession. The kind of possession
of one who is in the lawful occupation or custody
of the property, but not under a claim of title of
his own, but under a right derived from another,
as, for example, a tenant, bailee, licensee, etc.
Dispossession. The act of ousting or removing
one from the possession of property previously
held by him, which may be tortious and unlawful,

suance of law, as where a landlord "dispossesses"
his tenant at the expiration of the term or for oth-
er cause by the aid of judicial process.
Estate in possession. An estate whereby a
present interest passes to and resides in the ten-
ant, not depending on any subsequent circum-
stance or contingency. 2 Bl.Comm. 163. An es-
tate where the tenant is in actual pernancy, or
receipt of the rents and other advantages arising
therefrom. 2 Crabb, Real Prop. p. 958, § 2322.
Eberts v. Fisher, 44 Mich. 551, 7 N.W. 211; Sage
v. Wheeler, 3 App.Div. 38, 37 N.Y.S. 1107.
Exclusive possession. See Exclusive Posses-
sion.
Hostile possession. This term, as applied to an
occupant of real estate holding adversely, is not
construed as implying actual enmity or ill will,
but merely means that he claims to hold the pos-
session in the character of an owner, and there-
fore denies all validity to claims set up by any
and all other persons. Ballard v. Hansen, 33 Neb.
861, 51 N.W. 295; Mittet v. Hansen, 178 Wash.
541, 35 P.2d 93, 95.
Naked possession. The actual occupation of
real estate, but without any apparent or colorable
right to hold and continue such possession; spo-
ken of as the lowest and most imperfect degree
of title. 2 Bl.Comm. 195; Birdwell v. Burleson,
31 Tex.Civ.App. 31, 72 S.W. 446.
Natural possession. That by which a man de-
tains a thing corporeally, as, by occupying a
house, cultivating ground, or retaining a movable
in possession; natural possession is also defined
to be the corporeal detention of a thing which we
possess as belonging to us, without any title to
that possession or with a title which is void. Civ.
Code La. arts. 3428, 3430. Railroad Co. v. Le Ros-
en, 52 La.Ann. 192, 26 So. 854.
Open possession. Possession of real property
is said to be "open" when held without conceal-
ment or attempt at secrecy, or without being cov-
ered up in the name of a third person, or other-
wise attempted to be withdrawn from sight, but
in such a manner that any person interested can
ascertain who is actually in possession by prop-
er observation and inquiry. See Bass v. Pease, 79
Ill.App. 318
Peaceable possession. See Peaceable.
Pedal possession. In establishing title by ad-
verse possession this means actual possession;
that is, living upon or actually occupying the land,
or placing improvements directly upon it. Schaef-
fer v. Williams, Tex., 208 S.W. 220, 224.
Possession money. In English law. The man
whom the sheriff puts in possession of goods tak-
en under a writ of fieri facias is entitled, while
he continues so in possession, to a certain sum of
money per diem, which is thence termed "posses-
sion money." The amount is 3s. 6d. per day if
he is boarded, or 5s. per day if he is not boarded.
Brown.
Possession, writ of. Where the judgment in an
action of ejectment is for the delivery of the land
claimed, or its possession, this writ is used to put
the plaintiff in possession. It is in the nature of
execution.
Quasi possession. Is to a right what posses-
sion is to a thing, it is the exercise or enjoyment
of the right, not necessarily the continuous exer-
cise, but such an exercise as shows an intention
to exercise it at any time when desired. Sweet.
Scrambling possession. By this term is meant
a struggle for possession on the land itself, not
such a contest as is waged in the courts, or pos-
session gained by an act of trespass, such as
building a fence. Lobdell v. Keene, 85 Minn. 90,
88 N.W. 426.
Unity of possession. Joint possession of two
rights by several titles, as where a lessee of land
acquires the title in fee-simple, which extinguishes
the lease. The term also describes one of the es-
sential properties of a joint estate, each of the ten-
ants having the entire possession as well of every
parcel as of the whole. 2 Bl.Comm. 182.
Vacant possession. An estate which has been
abandoned, vacated, or forsaken by the tenant.
The abandonment must be complete in order to
make the possession vacant, and, therefore, if
the tenant have goods on the premises it will not
be so considered. 2 Chitty, Bail. 177; 2 Stria. 1064.

## POSSESSION IS A GOOD TITLE WHERE NO BETTER TITLE APPEARS

20 Vin.Abr. 278.
POSSESSION IS NINE-TENTHS OF THE LAW.
This adage is not to be taken as true to the full
extent, so as to mean that the person in posses-
sion can only be ousted by one whose title is nine
times better than his, but it places in a strong
light the legal truth that every claimant must
succeed by the strength of his own title, and not
by the weakness of his antagonist's. Wharton.

## POSSESSION VAUT TITRE

Fr. In English
law, as in most systems of jurisprudence, the
fact of possession raises a prima facie title or a
presumption of the right of property in the thing
possessed. In other words, the possession is as
good as the title (about.) Brown.
possession.

## POSSESSOR BONA FIDE

He is a bona fide
possessor who possesses as owner by virtue of
an act sufficient in terms to transfer property,
the defects of which he was ignorant of. He ceas-
es to be a bona fide possessor from the moment
these defects are made known to him, or are de-
clared to him by a suit instituted for the recovery
of the thing by the owner. Civ.Code La. art. 503.

## POSSESSOR MALA FIDE

The possessor in bad
faith is he who possesses as master, but who as-
sumes this quality, when he well knows that he
has no title to the thing, or that his title is vicious
and defective. Civ.Code La. art. 3452.

## POSSESSORY

Relating to possession; founded
on possession; contemplating or claiming posses-
sion.
Possessory action. See next title.
Possessory claim. The title of a pre-emptor
of public lands who has filed his declaratory state-
ment but has not paid for the land. Enoch v.
Spokane Falls & N. Ry. Co., 6 Wash. 393, 33 P. 966.
Possessory judgment. In Scotch practice. A
judgment which entitles a person who has unin-
terruptedly been in possession for seven years to
continue his possession until the question of right
be decided in due course of law. Bell.

ample, an attorney's lien on the papers and documents of
the client in his possession. Wood Sewing Mach. Co. v.
Boutelle, 56 Vt. 570, 48 Am. Rep. 821.

## POSSESSORY ACTION

An action which has
for its immediate object to obtain or recover the

tinguished from an action which merely seeks to
vindicate the plaintiff's title, or which involves
the bare right only; the latter being called a "pe-
titory" action.
An action founded on possession. Trespass for
injuries to personal property is called a "posses-
sory" action, because it lies only for a plaintiff
who, at the moment of the injury complained of,
was in actual or constructive, immediate, and ex-
clusive possession. 1 Chit.P1. 168, 169.
Admiralty practice. One which is brought to
recover the possession of a vessel, had under a
claim of title. The Tilton, 5 Mason, 465, Fed.Cas.

## POSSIBILITAS

Lat. Possibility; a possibility.
Possibilitas post dissolutionem executionis nun-
quam reviviscatur, a possibility will never be re-
vived after the dissolution of its execution. 1
Rolle, 321. Post executionem status, lex non
patitur possibilitatem, after the execution of an
estate the law does not suffer a possibility. 3
Bulst. 108.

## POSSIBILITY

An uncertain thing which may
happen. A contingent interest in real or person-
al estate. Kinzie v. Winston, 14 Fed.Cas. 651;
Bodenhamer v. Welch, 89 N.C. 78; Needles v.
Needles, 7 Ohio St. 442, 70 Am.Dec. 85.
It is either near, (or ordinary,) as where an es-
tate is limited to one after the death of another,
or remote, (or extraordinary,) as where it is lim-
ited to a man, provided he marries a certain wo-
man, and that she shall die and he shall marry
another.
Bare possibility. The same as a "naked" possi-
bility. See infra.
Naked possibility. A bare chance or expecta-
tion of acquiring a property or succeeding to an
estate in the future, but without any present
right in or to it which the law would recognize
as an estate or interest. Rogers v. Felton, 98
Ky. 148, 32 S.W. 406.
Possibility coupled with an interest. An ex-
pectation recognized in law as an estate or in-
terest, such as occurs in executory devises and
shifting or springing uses: such a possibility may
be sold or assigned.
Possibility of reverter. This term denotes no es-
tate, but only a possibility to have the estate at a
future time. Of such possibilities there are sever-
al kinds, of which two are usually denoted by the
term under consideration, (1) the possibility that
a common-law fee may return to the grantor by
breach of a condition subject to which it was
granted, (2) the possibility that a common-law
fee other than a fee simple may revert to the gran-
tor by the natural determination of the fee. Sor-
rels v. McNally, 89 Fla. 457, 105 So. 106, 109; Des
Moines City Ry. Co. v. City of Des Moines, 183
Iowa, 1261, 159 N.W. 450, 452, L.R.A.1918D, 839;
Trustees of Calvary Presbyterian Church of Buf-
falo v. Putnam, 221 App.Div. 502, 224 N.Y.S. 651,
Possibility on a possibility. A remote possibil-
ity, as if a remainder be limited in particular to
A.'s son John, or Edward, it is bad if he have no
son of that name, for it is too remote a possibility
that he should not only have a son, but a son of
that particular name. 2 Coke, 51.

## POSSIBLE

Capable of existing, happening, be-
ing, becoming or coming to pass; feasible, not
contrary to nature of things; neither necessitated
nor precluded; free to happen or not; contrasted
with necessary and impossible. In another sense,
the word denotes extreme improbability, without
excluding the idea of feasibility. It is also some-
times equivalent to "practicable" or "reasonable,"
as in some cases where action is required to be
taken "as soon as possible." Norris v. Elmdale
Elevator Co., 216 Mich. 548, 185 N.W. 696, 698;
Miller v. Southern Express Co., 99 S.C. 333, 83 S.

quent part of the book.

## POST

A conveyance for letters or dispatches.
The word is derived from "positi," the horses
carrying the letters or dispatches being kept or
placed at fixed stations. The word is also ap-
plied to the person who conveys the letters to the
houses where he takes up and lays down his
charge, and to the stages or distances between
house and house. Hence the phrases, post-boy,
post-horse, post-house, etc. Wharton.
A military establishment where a body of troops
is permanently fixed. Caldwell's Case, 19 Wall.
268, 22 L.Ed. 114; a military post is synonymous

assurance that such funds will exist when check
becomes due. Lovell v. Eaton, 99 Vt. 255, 133 A.
742, 743; State v. Langer, 46 N.D. 462, 177 N.W.

a writ, which lies for him who, having recovered

is again disseised by a former disseisor. Jacob.

## POST ENTRY

When goods are weighed or
measured, and the merchant has got an account
thereof at the custom-house, and finds his entry
already made too small, he must make a post or
additional entry for the surplusage, in the same
manner as the first was done. As a merchant is
always in time, prior to the clearing of the vessel,
to make his post, he should take care not to over-
enter, to avoid as well the advance as the trouble
of getting back the overplus. McCul.Dict.

## POST EXCHANGE

A voluntary association of
companies, detachments, or other army units at
military posts, permitted by a special regulation
of the War Department for the purpose of con-

plied by old writers to a second or younger son.
It is used in private international law to desig-

event, (such as the American Revolution or the

whose rights or status will be governed or af-
fected by the 'question of his birth before or aft-
er such event.

## POST-NOTES

A species of bank-notes payable
at a distant period, and not on demand.
They are a species of obligation resorted to by banks
when the exchanges of the country, and especially of the
banks, have become embarrassed by excessive speculations.
Much concern is then felt for the country, and through the
newspapers it is urged that post-notes be issued by the
banks "for aiding domestic and foreign exchanges," as a
"mode of relief," or a "remedy for the distress," and "to
take the place of the southern and foreign exchanges."
And so presently this is done. Post-notes are therefore
intended to enter into the circulation of the country as a
part of its medium of exchanges; the smaller ones for
ordinary business, and the larger ones for heavier opera-
tions. They are intended to supply the place of demand
notes, which the banks cannot afford to issue or reissue,
to relieve the necessities of commerce or of the banks, or
to avoid a compulsory suspension. They are under seal, or
without seal, and at long or short dates, at more or less
interest, or without interest, as the necessities of the bank
may require. Appeal of Hogg, 22 Pa. 488.

## POST-NUPTIAL

agreement entered into by a father after the
marriage of his daughter, by which he engages to

## POST OBIT BOND

A bond given by an expect-
ant, to become due on the death of a person from

N.Y., 92; Boynton v. Hubbard, 7 Mass. 119.

## POSTAL CURRENCY

During a brief period
following soon after the commencement of the,
civil war in the United States, when specie change.
was scarce, postage stamps were popularly used
as a substitute; and the first issues of paper rep-
resentatives of parts of a dollar, issued by author-
ity of congress, were called "postal currency.",
This issue was soon merged in others of a more
permanent character, for which the later and
more appropriate name is "fractional currency."
Abbott.

The act of
congress of June 25, 1910, c. 386, 36 Stat. 814 (39

treasury, and the attorney general) to establish
such depositories. Deposits may be made by any
person of ten years or over, in his or her name, or
by a married woman in her own name and free
from her husband's control. Deposits may be
made of $1 or multiples thereof, and any person

## POSTERIORES

Lat. This term was used by
the Romans to denote the descendants in a di-
rect line beyond the sixth degree.

## POSTERIORITY

This is a word of comparison
and relation in tenure, the correlative of which is
the word "priority." Thus, a man who held lands
or tenements of two lords was said to hold of
his more ancient lord by priority, and of his less
ancient lord by posteriority. Old Nat.Brev. 94.
It has also a general application in law consistent
with its etymological meaning, and, as so used, it
is likewise opposed to priority. Brown.

## POSTERITY

All the descendants of a person in
a direct line to the remotest generation. Breckin-
ridge v. Denny, 8 Bush (Ky.) 527.

## POSTHUMOUS WORK

Work on which origin-
al copyright has been taken out by someone to
whom literary property passed before publication.
Shapiro, Bernstein & Co. v. Bryan, C.C.A.N.Y., 123
F.2d 697, 699.

## POSTLIMINIUM

Lat. In the civil law. A doc-
trine or fiction of the law by which the restoration
of a person to any status or right formerly pos-
sessed by him was considered as relating back to
the time of his original loss or deprivation; par-
ticularly in the case of one who, having been tak-
en prisoner in war, and having escaped and re-
turned to Rome, was regarded, by the aid of this
fiction, as having never been abroad, and was
thereby reinstated in all his rights. Inst. 1, 12, 5.

ue: adjourn; as when a hearing is postponed.
Also to place after; to set below something else;
as when an earlier lien is for some reason post-
poned to a later lien.
The word "postpone" carries with it the idea of de-
ferring the doing of something or the taking effect of some-
thing until a future or later time. Gartner v. Roth, Cal.,
157 P.2d 361, 363.
The word "postponement," in speaking of legal proceed-
ings, is nearly equivalent to "continuance;" except that
the former word is generally preferred when describing
an adjournment of the cause to another day during the
term, and the latter when the case goes over to another
term. State v. Underwood, 76 Mo. 639; State v. Nathaniel,
52 La. Ann. 558, 26 So. 1008.

## POT-DE-VIN

In French law. A sum of money
frequently paid, at the moment of entering into a
contract, beyond the price agreed upon. It dif-

mote and near; that which never comes into ac-
tion is a power the most'remote and vain.

## POTENTIA NON EST NISI AD BONUM

Power

to existence at some future time, though not now
existing; for example, the future product of grain
or trees already planted, or the successive future
installments or payments on a contract or engage-
ment already made. Things having a "potential
existence" may be the subject of mortgage, as-
signment, or sale. Campbell v. Grant Co., 36 Tex.
Civ.App. 641, 82 S.W. 796; Dickey v. Waldo, 97
Mich. 255, 56 N.W. 608, 23 L.R.A 449; Long v.

Bench, and probably older than the kingdom." Maine,
Early Hist. of Inst., p. 263.
A measure of weight. The pound avoirdupois
contains 7,000 grains; the pound troy 5,760 grains.
In New York, the unit or standard of weight from which
all other weights shall be derived and ascertained, is
declared to be the pound, of such magnitude that the

iso. Cowell.
POURPRESTURE- An inclosure. Anything
done to the nuisance or hurt of the public de-
mesnes, or the highways, etc., by inclosure or

presture and a public nuisance is that pourpres-
ture is an invasion of the jus privatum of the
crown; but where the jus publicum is violated it
is a nuisance. Skene makes three sorts of this
offense: (1) Against the crown; (2) against the
lord of the fee; (3) against a neighbor. 2 Inst.

## POWER

The right, ability, of faculty of doing
something. Clifford v. Helvering, C.C.A.8, 105 F.
2d 586, 591. Authority to do any act which the
grantor might himself lawfully perform. In re
Morrison's Estate, 173 Misc. 503, 18 N.Y.S.2d 235,

authority reserved by, or limited to, a person to
dispose of real or personal property, for his own
benefit, or benefit of others, or enabling one per-
son to dispose of interest which is vested in an-
other. In re Vanatta's Estate, 99 N.J.Eq. 339, 131
A. 515, 518; Hupp v. Union Coal & Coke Co., 284
Pa. 529, 131 A. 364, 365; Security Trust & Safe

on, which the owner granting or reserving such
power might himself perform for any purpose.
Civ.Code Dak. § 298 (Comp.Laws N.D.1913, § 5383;
Rev.Code S.D.1919, § 390) ; How.St.Mich. § 5591
(Comp.Laws 1929, § 12996).
"Power" is sometimes used in the same sense as "right,"
as when we speak of the powers of user and disposition
which the owner of property has over it, but, strictly
speaking, a power is that which creates a special or excep-
tional right, or enables a person to do something which he
could not otherwise do. Sweet.
Technically, an authority by which one person
enables another to do some act for him. 2 Lil.
Abr. 339.
An authority enabling a person to dispose,
through the medium of the statute of uses, of an
interest, vested either in himself or in another
person. Sugd. Powers, 82. An authority ex-
pressly reserved to a grantor, or expressly
given to another, to be exercised over lands,
etc., granted or conveyed at the time of the
creation of such power. Watk.Conv. 157. A
proviso, in a conveyance under the statute of uses,
giving to the grantor or grantee, or a stranger,
authority to revoke or alter by a subsequent act
the estate first granted. 1 Steph.Comm. 505; Bur-
leigh v. Clough, 52 N.H. 267, 13 Am.Rep. 23; Grif-
fith v. Maxfield, 66 Ark. 513, 51 S.W. 832, Bouton
v. Doty, 69 Conn. 531, 37 A. 1064; Law Guarantee
& Trust Co. v. Jones, 103 Tenn. 245, 58 S.W. 219.
There is a clear distinction between a power and a trust,
since "powers" are never imperative, but leave the act to
be done at the will of the donee of the power, while
"trusts" are always imperative, and are obligatory on the
conscience of the trustee. People v. Kaiser, 306 Ill. 313,
137 N.E. 826, 828; Hirschmann v. Gantt, 136 S.C. 1, 134
S.E. 230, 231.
General
Appendant or appurtenant powers. Those exist-
ing where the donee of the power has an estate in
the land and the power is to take effect wholly or
in part out of that estate, and the estate created
by its exercise affects the estate and interest of
the donee of the power. Baker v. Wilmert, 288 Ill.
434, 123 N.E. 627, 629; Taylor v. Phillips, 147 Ga.
761, 95 S.E. 289.
Collateral powers. Those in which the donee
of the power has no interest or estate in the land
which is the subject of the power. Also called
"naked powers." 2 Washb.R.P. 305; Baker v.
Wilmert, 288 Ill. 434, 123 N.E. 627, 629.
Executive power. See Executive Power.
Exclusive power. See Exclusive Power.
General and special powers. A power is gen-
eral when it authorizes the alienation in fee, by
means of a conveyance, will, or charge, of the
lands embraced in the power to any alienee what-
soever. It is special (1) when the persons or class
of persons to whom the disposition of the lands
under the power is to be made are designated, or
(2) when the power authorizes the alienation, by
means of a conveyance, will, or charge, of a par-
ticular estate or interest less than a fee. Coster
v. Lorillard, 14 Wend. (N.Y.) 324; Thompson v.
General and special powers in trust. A general
power is in trust when any person or class of per-
sons other than the grantee of such power is des-
ignated as entitled to the proceeds or any portion
of the proceeds or other benefits to result from
the alienation. A special power is in trust (1)
when the disposition or charge which it authorizes
is limited to be made to any person or class of
persons other than the holder of the power, or (2)
when any person or class of persons other than
the holder is designated as entitled to any benefit
from the disposition or charge authorized by the
power. Cutting v. Cutting, 20 Hun (N.Y.) 360;
Dana v. Murray, 122 N.Y. 612, 26 N.E. 23; 60 Oki.
St.Ann. §§ 191, 192.
Inherent powers. Those which are enjoyed by
the possessors of natural right, without having
been received from another. Such are the powers
of a people to establish a form of government, of
a father to control his children. Some of these
are regulated and restricted in their exercise by
law, but are not technically considered in the law
as powers.
Ministerial powers. A phrase used in English
conveyancing to denote powers given for the good,
not of the donee himself exclusively, or of the
donee himself necessarily at all, but for the good
of several persons, including or not including the
donee also. They are so called because the donee
of them is as a minister or servant in his exer-
cise of them. Brown.
Naked power. One which is simply collateral
and without interest in the donee, which arises
when, to a mere stranger, authority is given of
disposing of an interest, in which he had not be-
fore, nor has by the instrument creating the pow-
er, any estate whatsoever. Bergen v. Bennett, 1
Caines Cas. (N.Y.) 15, 2 Am.Dec. 281; Hunt v.
Ennis, 12 Fed.Cas. 915; Atzinger v. Berger, 151
Ky. 800, 152 S.W. 971, 972, 50 L.R.A.,N.S., 622.
Power of revocation. A power which is to di-
vest or abridge an, existing estate. Distinguished
from those of appointment; but the distinction is
of doubtful exactness, as every new appointment
must divest or revoke a former use. Sanders,
Uses 154.
Power of visitation. A power vested by the
founder in an appointed visitor, or the trustees or
governors of an institution, to regulate its inter-
nal affairs and to appoint professors, elect schol-
arships, officers, and the like. In re Norton, 97
Misc.Rep. 289, 161 N.Y.S. 710, 717.
Powers in gross. Those which give a donee of
the power, who has an estate in the land, author-
ity to create such estates only as will not attach
on the interest limited to him or take effect out
of his interest, but will take effect after donee's
estate has terminated. Baker v. Wilmert, 288 Ill.
434, 123 N.E. 627; Taylor v. Phillips, 147 Ga. 761,
95 S.E. 289, 290.
Constitutional Law
The right to take action in respect to a par-
ing more or less of discretion, granted by the con-
stitutions to the several departments or branches
of the government, or reserved to the people.
Powers in this sense are generally classified as
legislative, executive, and judicial. See those ti-
tles.
Implied powers are such as are necessary to
make available and carry into effect those powers
which are expressly granted or conferred, and
which must therefore be presumed to have been
within the intention of the constitutional or leg-
islative grant. First M. E. Church v. Dixon, 178
Ill. 260, 52 N.E. 887; In re Board of Com'rs of
Cook County, 146 Minn. 103, 177 N.W. 1013, 1014;
Skelly Oil Co. v. Pruitt & McCrory, 94 Okl. 232, 221

Lackawanna & W. V. Power Co., 255 Pa. 176, 99 A.
465, 467.
Law of Corporations
The right or capacity to act or be acted upon
in a particular manner or in respect to a particu-
lar subject; as, the power to have a corporate
seal, to sue and be sued, to make by-laws, to carry
on a particular business or construct a given
work. See Freligh v. Saugerties, 70 Hun, 589, 24
N.Y.S. 182; In re Lima & H. F. Ry. Co., 68 Hun,
252, 22 N.Y.S. 967.
For other compound terms, such as "Power of
Appointment," "Power of Sale," etc., see the fol-
lowing titles.

## POWER COUPLED WITH AN INTEREST

A
right or power to do some act, together with an
interest in the subject-matter on which the power
is to be exercised. It is distinguished from a nak-
ed power, which is a mere authority to act, not
accompanied by any interest of the donee in the
subject-matter of the power. Arcweld Mfg. Co. v.
Burney, 12 Wash.2d 212, 121 P.2d 350, 355.
Is it an interest in the subject on which the power is to
be exercised, or is it an interest in that which is produced
by the exercise of the power ? We hold it to be clear that
the interest which can protect a power after the death of
a person who creates it must be an interest in the thing
itself. In other words, the power must be engrafted on an
estate in the thing. The words themselves would seem to
import this meaning. "A power coupled with an interest"
is a power which accompanies or is connected with an
interest. The power and the interest are united in the
same person. But, if we are to understand by the word
"interest" an interest in that which is to be produced by
the exercise of the power, then they are never united. The
power to produce the interest must be exercised, and by
its exercise is extinguished. The power ceases when the
interest commences, and therefore cannot, in accurate law
language, be said to be "coupled" with it. And see Mis-
souri v. Walker, 8 S.Ct. 929, 125 U.S. 339, 31 L.Ed. 769;
Griffith v. Maxfield, 66 Ark. 513, 51 S.W. 832; Hunt v.
Ennis, 12 Fed.Cas. 915; Chase Nat. Bank of New York v.
Sayles, 11 F.2d 948, 957; Sphier v. Michael,
112 Or. 229, 229 P. 1100, 1101; Drake v. O'Brien, 99 W.Va.
582, 130 S.E. 276, 278.

## POWER OF APPOINTMENT

A power or au-
thority conferred by one person by deed or will
upon another (called the "donee") to appoint, that
is, to select and nominate, the person or persons
who are to receive and enjoy an estate or an in-
come therefrom or from a fund, after the testa-
tor's death, or the donee's death, or after the ter-
mann v. De Wolf, 25 R.I. 243, 55 A. 707; People v.
Kaiser, 306 Ill. 313, 137 N.E. 826, 828.
The distinction between a "will" and a "power of ap-
pointment" is that a will concerns the estate of the testa-
tor, while an appointment under a power concerns that of
the donor of the power. Thompson v. Pew, 214 Mass. 520,
102 N.E. 122, 125.
Powers are either : Collateral, which are given to stran-
gers; i. e., to persons who have neither a present nor fu-
ture estate or interest in the land. These are also called
simply "collateral," or powers not coupled with an inter-
est, or powers not being interests. Or they are powers
relating to the land. These are called "appendant" or
"appurtenant," because they strictly depend upon the
estate limited to the person to whom they are given. Thus,
where an estate for life is limited to a man, with a power
to grant leases in possession, a lease granted under the
power may operate wholly out of the life-estate of the
party executing it, and must in every case have its opera-
tion out of his estate during his life. Such an estate must
be created, which will attach on an interest actually vested
in himself. Or they are called "in gross," if given to a
person who had an interest in the estate at the execution of
the deed creating the power, or to whom an estate is given
by the deed, but which enabled him to create such estates
only as will not attach on the interest limited to him. Of
necessity, therefore, where a man seised in fee settles his
estate on others, reserving to himself only a particular
power, the power is in gross.
A power to a tenant for life to appoint the estate after
his death among his children, a power to jointure a wife
after his death, a power to raise a term of years to com-
mence from his death, for securing younger children's por-
tions, are all powers in gross. An important distinction is
established between general and particular powers. By a
general power we understand a right to appoint to whom-
soever the donee pleases. By a particular power it is
meant that the donee is restricted to some objects desig-
nated in the deed creating the power, as to his own chil-
dren. Wharton.
A general power is beneficial when no person other than
the grantee has, by the terms of its creation, any interest
in its execution. A general power is in trust when any
person or class of persons, other than the grantee of such
power, is designated as entitled to the proceeds, or any
portion of the proceeds, or other benefits to result from the
alienation. Cutting v. Cutting, 20 Hun, N.Y., 364.
When a power of appointment among a class requires
that each shall have a share, it is called a "distributive"
or "non-exclusive" power ; when it authorizes, but does
not direct, a selection of one or more to the exclusion of
the others, it is called an "exclusive" power, and is also
distributive; when it gives the power of appointing to a
certain number of the class, but not to all, it is exclusive
only, and not distributive. Leake, 389. A power authoriz-
ing the donee either to give the whole to one of a class or
to give it equally among such of them as he may select
(but not to give one a larger share than the others) is
called a "mixed" power. Sugd.Powers, 448. Sweet.

## POWER OF ATTORNEY

An instrument au-
thorizing another to act as one's agent or attor-
ney. A letter of attorney. Arcweld Mfg. Co. v.
Burney, 12 Wash.2d 212, 121 P.2d 350, 354; Olive-
Sternenberg Lumber Co. v. Gordon, Tex.Civ.App.,
143 S.W.2d 694, 698. See Attorney.

## POWER OF DISPOSITION

Every power of dis-
position is deemed absolute, by means of which
the donee of such power is enabled in his life-time
to dispose of the entire fee for his own benefit;
and, where a general and beneficial power to de-
vise the inheritance is given to a tenant for life
or years, it is absolute, within the meaning of the
statutes of some of the states. See Power of Ap-
pointment.

## POWER OF SALE

A clause sometimes inserted
gagee (or trustee) the right and power, on de-
fault in the payment of the debt secured, to adver-
tise and sell the mortgaged property at public
auction (but without resorting to a court for au-
thority), satisfy the creditor out of the net pro-
ceeds, convey by deed to the purchaser, return
the surplus, if any, to the mortgagor, and thereby
divest the latter's estate entirely and without
any subsequent right of redemption. Capron v.
Attleborough Bank, 11 Gray (Mass.) 493; Appeal
of Clark, 70 Conn. 195, 39 A. 155.

## POYNDING

See Poinding.

## POYNINGS' ACT

An act of parliament, made
in Ireland, (10 Hen. VII. c. 22, A.D. 1495; ) so called

of force in Ireland, which, before that time, they
were not. 1 Broom & H.Comm. 112.

## PRACTICABLE, PRACTICABLY

Practicable is
that which may be done, practiced, or accomplish-
ed, that which is performable, feasible, possible;
and the adverb practicably means in a practicable

## PRECIPITIN TEST

Precipitins are formations
in the blood of an animal induced by repeated in-
jections into its veins of the blood-serum of an ani-
mal of another species; and their importance in
diagnosis lies in the fact that when the blood-
serum of an animal so treated is mixed with that
of any animal of the second species (or a closely
related species) and the mixture kept at a tem-
perature of about 98 degrees for several hours,
a visible precipitate will result, but not so if the
second ingredient of the mixture is drawn from
an animal of an entirely different species. In
medico-legal practice, therefore, a suspected stain
or clot having been first tested by other methods
and demonstrated to be blood, the question wheth-
er it is the blood of a human being or of other
origin is resolved by mixing a solution of it with
a quantity of blood-serum taken from a rabbit or
some other small animal which has been previous-
ly prepared by injections of human blood-serum.
After treatment as above described, the presence
of a precipitate will furnish strong presumptive
evidence that the blood tested was of human ori-
gin. The test is not absolutely conclusive, for the
reason that blood from an anthropoid ape would
produce the same result, in this experiment, as
human blood. But if the alternative hypothesis
presented attributed the blood in question to some
animal of an unrelated species (as, a dog, sheep,
or horse) the precipitin test could be fully relied
on, as also in the case where no precipitate re-
sulted.

## PRECIPUT

## PREDOMINANT

Something greater or superior
in power and influence to others with which it
is connected or compared. Matthews v. Bliss, 22
Pick. (Mass.) 53.
PRE–EMPTION. In international law. The right
of pre-emption is the right of a nation to detain
the merchandise of strangers passing through
her territories or seas, in order to afford to her
subjects the preference of purchase. 1 Chit.Com.
Law, 103.
According to general modern usage the doctrine of pre-
emption, as applied in time of war rests upon the distinc-
tion between articles which are contraband (q. v.) uni-
versally, and those which are contraband only under the
particular circumstances of the case. The carrying of the
former class entails the penalty of confiscation, either of
ship or cargo or both. The latter class, while confiscable
according to strict law, are sometimes merely subjected to
the milder belligerent right of pre-emption, which is re-
garded as a fair compromise between the right of the
belligerent to seize, and the claim of the neutral to export
his native commodities, though immediately subservient to
the purpose of hostility; 3 Phill.Int.L. 450; 1 C.Rob. 241.
The right of pre-emption is said to be rather a waiver of a
greater right than a right itself ; an indulgence to the
neutral rather than a right of the belligerent; Ward, Con-
traband 196.
In ,English law. The first buying of a thing.

## PREMISES

That which is put before; that
which precedes; the foregoing statements. Thus,
in logic, the two introductory propositions of the
syllogism are called the "premises," and from
them the conclusion is deduced. So, in pleading,

means in consideration of the matters herein-
before stated. Alaska Imp. Co. v. Hirsch, 119

Co., C.C.A.Wash., 211 F. 254, 259.

transaction is founded; and it is here, also, the
consideration on which it
and the certainty of the thing granted. 2 Bl.

In equity pleading. The stating part of a bill.

108 So. 903, 905, or a distinct portion of real es-
tate. Ruble v. Ruble, Tex.Civ.App., 264 S.W. 1018,
The term "premises" is used in common parlance to sig-
nify land, with its appurtenances; but its usual and ap-
propriate meaning in a conveyance is the interest or estate
demised or granted by the deed. State v. French, 120 Ind.
229, 22 N.E. 108; Cooper v. Robinson, 302 Ill. 181, 134 N.E.
119, 120.

men's Compensation Acts means on the property

so connected with the business in which the em-
ployee is engaged as to form a component or in-
tegral part of it. Werner v. Allegheny County,
153 Pa.Super. 10, 33 A.2d 451, 453.
The words "premises" and "plant" are sometimes dis-
tinguished; "premises" refers to place and territory, while
"plant" includes place and territory, together with the
appliances and things which go to make the facilities for
the execution of the design and purposes of the enterprise.
Martin v. Matson Nay. Co., D.C.Wash., 244 F. 976, 977.

or face value. Boston & M. R. R. v. U. S., C.C.A.
Mass., 265 F. 578, 579. See Par.
In granting a lease, part of the rent is some-
times capitalized and paid in a lump sum at the
time the lease is granted. This is called a "pre-
mium."
The sum paid or agreed to be paid by an as-

of a person. See Cas. Hardw. 286; 1 Tayl. 148.

ing or arranging means or measures necessary
for its commission, while attempt is direct move-
ment toward commission after preparations are
made. People v. George, 74 Cal.App. 440, 241 P.
97, 100. State v. Quick, 199 S.C. 256, 19 S.E.2d 101,
PREPARE. To provide with necessary means;
to make ready; to provide with what is appro-
priate or necessary. Brennan v. Northern Elec-
tric Co., 72 Mont. 35, 231 P. 388, 389.

## PREPARED COAL

means sizes of coal above pea. New York, N. H.
& H. R. Co. v. Salter, 104 Conn. 728, 134 A. 220,
PREPENSE. Forethought; preconceived; pre-
meditated. See Territory v. Bannigan, 1 Dak. 451,
46 N.W. 597; People v. Clark, 7 N.Y. 385.

## PREPONDERANCE

Greater weight of evidence,
or evidence which is more credible and convinc-
ing to the mind. Button v. Metcalf, 80 Wis. 193,
49 N.W. 809. That which best accords with rea-
son and probability. U. S. v. McCaskill, D.C.Fla.,
200 F. 332. The word "preponderance" means
something more than "weight"; it denotes a su-
periority of weight, or outweighing. The words
are not synonymous, but substantially different.
There is generally a "weight" of evidence on each
side in case of contested facts. But juries cannot
properly act upon the weight of evidence, in fa-
vor of the one having the onus, unless it over-
bear, in some degree, the weight upon the other
side. Mathes v. Aggler & Musser Seed Co., 178
P. 713, 715, 179 Cal. 697; Barnes v. Phillips, 184
Ind. 415, 111 N.E. 419. See, also, Weight of Evi-
dence.
It rests with that evidence which, when fairly considered,
produces the stronger impression, and has the greater
weight, and is more convincing as to its truth when
weighed against the evidence in opposition thereto. S. Ya-
mamoto v. Puget Sound Lumber Co., 84 Wash. 411, 146 P.
861, 863; but it does not mean greater number of wit-
nesses. Heerdink v. Kohmescher, 94 Ind.App. 296, 180 N.E.
683, 684.
Preponderance of evidence may not be determined by
the number of witnesses, but by the greater weight of all
evidence, which does not necessarily mean the greater
number of witnesses, but opportunity for knowledge, in-
formation possessed, and manner of testifying determines
the weight of testimony. Garver v. Garver, 52 Colo. 227,
121 P. 165, 166, Ann.Cas.1913D, 674.

## PREROGATIVE

An exclusive or peculiar privi-
lege. The special power, privilege, immunity, or
advantage vested in an official person, either gen-
erally, or in respect to the things of his office, or
in an official body, as a court or legislature. At-
torney General v. Blossom, 1 Wis. 317; Attorney
General v. Eau Claire, 37 Wis. 443.
In English law. A power or will which is dis-
cretionary, and above and uncontrolled by any
other will. That special pre-eminence which the
king (or queen) has over and above all other per-
sons, in right of his (or her) regal dignity. A
term used to denote those rights and capacities
which the sovereign enjoys alone, in contradis-
tinction to others. 1 Bl.Comm. 239. It is some-
times applied by law writers to the thing over
which the power or will is exercised, as fiscal
prerogatives, meaning king's revenues; 1 Hal-
leck, Int. L. 147.

## PREROGATIVE COURT

In English law. A
court established for the trial of all testamentary
causes, where the deceased left bona notabilia
within two different dioceses; in which case the
probate of wills belonged to the archbishop of
the province, by way of special prerogative. And
all causes relating to the wills, administrations,
or legacies of such persons were originally cog-
nizable herein, before a judge appointed by the
archbishop, called the "judge of the prerogative
court," from whom an appeal lay to the privy
council. 3 Bl.Comm. 66; 3 Steph.Comm. 432.
In New Jersey the prerogative court is the court of ap-
peal from decrees of the orphans' courts in the several
counties of the state. The court is held before the chan-
cellor, under the title of the "ordinary." Flanigan v. Gug-
genheim Smelting Co., 63 N.J.L. 647, 44 A. 762; Robinson
v. Fair, 128 U.S. 53, 9 S.Ct. 30, 32 L. Ed. 415.

## PREROGATIVE LAW

That part of the common
law of England which is more particularly applic-
able to the king. Com. Dig. tit. "Ley," A.

## PREROGATIVE WRITS

In English law, the
name is given to certain judicial writs issued by
the courts only upon proper cause shown, never
as a mere matter of right, the theory being that
they involve a direct interference by the govern-
ment with the liberty and property of the sub-
ject, and therefore are justified only as an exer-
cise of the extraordinary power (prerogative) of
the crown. In America, a theory has sometimes
been advanced that these writs should issue only
in cases publici juris and those affecting the sov-
ereignty of the state, or its franchises or preroga-
tives, or the liberties of the people. But their is-
suance is now generally regulated by statute, and
the use of the term "prerogative," in describing
them, amounts only to a reference to their origin
and history. These writs are the writs of man-
damus, procedendo, prohibition, quo warranto, ha-
beas corpus, and certiorari. Click v. Click, 98 W.
Va. 419, 127 S.E. 194, 195.

tems of church polity known as the "Christian
Protestant Church", occupying an intermediate
position between episcopacy and congregational-
ism. Trustees of Pencader Presbyterian Church
in Pencader Hundred v. Gibson, Del., 22 A.2d 782,
788. A religious faith or doctrine, based on the

## PRESBYTERIUM

That part of the church
where divine offices are performed; formerly ap-
plied to the choir or chancel, because it was the
place appropriated to the bishop, priest, and other
clergy, while the laity were confined to the body
of the church. Jacob.

## PRESCRIBABLE

That to which a right may be
acquired by prescription.

## PRESCRIBE

To assert a right or title to the en-
joyment of a thing, on the ground of having hith-
erto had the uninterrupted and immemorial en-
joyment of it.
To lay down authoritatively as a guide, direc-
tion, or rule; to impose as a peremptory order;
to dictate; to point; to direct; to give as a guide,
direction, or rule of action; to give law. State v.
Truax, 130 Wash. 69, 226 P. 259, 260, 33 A.L.R.
1206; McMahon v. Devlin, 254 N.Y. 397, 173 N.E.
560, 561.
To direct; define; mark out. Field v. Marye,
83 Va. 882, 3 S.E. 707.
In modern statutes relating to matters of an administra-
tive nature, such as procedure, registration, etc., it is usual
to indicate in general terms the nature of the proceedings
to be adopted, and to leave the details to be prescribed or
regulated by rules or orders to be made for that purpose
in pursuance of an authority contained in the act. Sweet.
Mansfield v. People, 164 Ill. 611, 45 N.E. 976.

designate, or order use of a remedy. State v.
Whipple, 143 Minn. 403, 173 N.W. 801, 802.

## PRESCRIPTION

edies for a disease and the manner of using them;
a formula for the preparation of a drug and med-
icine. People v. Cohen, 94 Misc. 355, 157 N.Y.S.
591, 593.
International Law
Acquisition of sovereignty over a territory
through continuous and undisputed exercise of
sovereignty over it during such a period as is nec-
essary to create under the influence of historical
development the general conviction that the pres-
ent condition of things is in conformity with in-
ternational order. State of Arkansas v. State of
Tennessee, Ark. & Tenn., 60 S.Ct. 1026, 1030, 310
U.S. 563, 84 L.Ed. 1362.
Real Property Law
The name given to a mode of acquiring ti-
tle to incorporeal hereditaments by immemorial
or long-continued enjoyment. Zetrouer v. Zetrou-
er, 89 Fla. 253, 103 So. 625, 627. Hester v. Saw-
yers, 41 N.M. 497, 71 P.2d 646, 649, 112 A.L.R. 536.
To create an easement by "prescription," the use must
have been open, continuous, exclusive, and under claim of
right for statutory period. Burk v. Diers, 102 Neb. 721,
169 N.W. 263, 264.
"Prescription" is the term usually applied to incorporeal
hereditaments, while "adverse possession" is applied to
lands. Hindley v. Metropolitan EL R. Co., 85 N.Y.S. 561,
42 Misc. 56.
In Louisiana, prescription is defined as a manner of ac-
quiring the ownership of property, or discharging debts,
by the effect of time, and under the conditions regulated
by law. Each of these prescriptions has its special and par-
ticular definition. The prescription by which the owner-
ship of property is acquired, is a right by which a mere
possessor acquires the ownership of a thing which he pos-
sesses by the continuance of his possession during the time
fixed by law. The prescription by which debts are re-
leased, is a peremptory and perpetual bar to every species
of action, real or personal, when the creditor has been
silent for a certain time without urging his claim. Civ.
Code La. arts. 3457-3459. In this sense of the term it is
very nearly equivalent to what is elsewhere expressed by
"limitation of actions," or rather, the "bar of the statute
of limitations."
There is a distinction between title by "limitation" and
a "prescriptive title," in that the latter is based upon a
presumed grant to the property or use, while the former
is not, Abel v. Love, 81 Ind. App. 328, 143 N.E. 515, 520,
while the distinction between a highway by prescription
and one by dedication is that "prescription" is an adverse
holding under color of right, while a "dedication," whether
expressed or implied, rests upon the consent of the owner.
Hatch Bros. Co. v. Black, 25 Wyo. 416, 171 P. 267, 270.
"Prescription" and "custom" are frequently confounded
in common parlance, arising perhaps from the fact that
immemorial usage was essential to both of them ; but,
strictly, they materially differ from one another, in that
custom is properly a local impersonal usage, such as bor-
ough-English, or postremogeniture, which is annexed to a
given estate, while prescription is simply personal, as that
a certain man and his ancestors, or those whose estate he
enjoys, have immemorially exercised a right of pasture-
common in a certain parish, and usage differs from both,
for it may be either to persons or places. Again, prescrip-
tion has its origin in a grant, evidenced by usage, and is
allowed on account of its loss, either actual or supposed,
and therefore only those things can be prescribed for which
could be raised by a grant previously to 8 & 9 Vict. c. 106,
§ 2; but this principle does not necessarily hold in the case
of a custom. Wharton; Olin v. Kingsbury, 168 N.Y.S. 766,
770, 181 App. Div. 348.
In General
Corporations by prescription. In English law.
Those which have existed beyond the memory of
man, and therefore are looked upon in law to be
Prescription act. The statute 2 & 3 Wm. IV. c.
71, passed to limit the period of prescription in
certain cases.
Prescription in a que estate. A claim of pre-
scription based on the immemorial enjoyment of
the right claimed, by the claimant and those for-
mer owners "whose estate" he has succeeded to
and holds. Donnell v. Clark, 19 Me. 182.
Time of prescription. The length of time neces-
sary to establish a right claimed by prescription
or a title by prescription. Before the act of 2 &
3 Wm. IV. c. 71, the possession required to consti-
tute a prescription must have existed "time out
of mind" or "beyond the memory of man," that
is, before the reign of Richard I.; but the time
of prescription, in certain cases, was much short-
tened by that act. 2 Steph.Comm. 35.

## PRESENCE

Act, fact, or state of being in a
certain place and not elsewhere, or within sight or
call, at hand, or in some place that is being
thought of. London v. Maryland Casualty Co.,
10 Minn. 581, 299 N.W. 193, 194; the existence of
a person in a particular place at a given time
particularly with reference to some act done
there and then. Besides actual presence, the law
recognizes constructive presence, which latter
may be predicated of a person who, though not on
the very spot, was near enough to be accounted
present by the law, or who was actively co-oper-
ating with another who was actually present.
Mitchell v. Com., 33 Grat., Va., 868.

## PRESENCE OF AN OFFICER

An offense is
committed in "presence" or "view" of officer, with-
in rule authorizing arrest without warrant, when
officer sees act constituting it, though at distance,
or when circumstances within his observation give
probable cause for belief that defendant has com-
mitted offense, or when he hears disturbance cre-
ated by offense and proceeds at once to scene, or
if offense is continuing, or has not been fully
consummated when arrest is made. Kennington-
Saenger, Inc., v. Wicks, 168 Miss. 566, 151 So. 549,
551. Mantei v. State, 210 Wis. 1, 245 N.W. 683,
PRESENCE OF THE COURT. A contempt is in
the "presence of the court," if it is committed in
the ocular view of the court, or where the court
has direct knowledge of the contempt. People v.
Cochrane, 307 Ill. 126, 138 N.E. 291, 293.

## PRESENCE OF THE TESTATOR

Will is at-
tested in presence of testator if witnesses are
within range of any of testator's senses. In re
Demaris' Estate, 166 Or. 36, 110 P.2d 571, 585, 586.

for a decision or settlement to proper authorities.
Haynes v. State, 108 Tex.Cr.R. 62, 299 S.W. 234,
In the law of negotiable instruments. Primar-
ily, to present is to tender or offer. Thus, to pre-
sent a bill of exchange for acceptance or payment
is to exhibit it to the drawee or acceptor, (or his
authorized agent,) with an express or implied de-
mand for acceptance or payment. Byles, Bills,
183, 201.
Claims are "presented" to the probate court
when placed in the custody of the court, or filed
or made a matter of record therein, State v. Pro-
bate Court of Hennepin County, 145 Minn. 344,
177 N.W. 354, 11 A.L.R. 242; and to present claim
against city, within statute providing that claims
for damages against the city must be "presented"
to the city or town council and filed with the city
or town clerk, means to hand to and leave with.

posed to one in reversion or remainder.
PRESENTMENT.
Criminal Practice
The written notice taken by a grand jury of
any offense, from their own knowledge or observa-
tion, without any bill of indictment laid before
them at the suit of the government. 4 Bl. Comm.
301; Bennett v. Kalamazoo Circuit Judge, 183
Mich. 200, 150 N.W. 141, 142, Ann.Cas.1916E, 223.
Presentments are also made in courts-leet and
courts-baron, before the stewards. Steph. Comm.
The writing which contains the accusation so
presented by a grand jury. U. S. v. Hill, 1 Brock.
156, Fed.Cas.No.-15,364.
In an extended sense, the term includes not only
presentments properly so called, but also inquisi-
tions of office and indictments found by a grand
jury. 2 Hawk. Pl. Cr. c. 25, § 1.
An informal statement in writing, by the grand jury,
representing to the court that a public offense has been
committed which is triable in the county, and that there is
reasonable ground for believing that a particular individ-
ual named or described therein has committed it. Eason v.
State, 11 Ark. 482; State v. Kiefer, 90 Md. 165, 44 A. 1043.
An accusation of crime, made by a grand jury from their
own knowledge or from evidence furnished them by wit-
nesses or by one or more of their members. In re Report
of Grand Jury of Baltimore City, 152 Md. 616, 137 A. 370,
The difference between a presentment and an inquisition
is this : that the former is found by a grand jury author-
ized to inquire of offenses generally, whereas the latter i§
an accusation found by a jury specially returned to inquire
concerning the particular offense. 2 Hawk.P1.Cr. c. 25, § 6.
An indictment differs from a presentment in that the
former must be indorsed "A true bill," followed by the
signature of the grand jury foreman; a presentment is to
be signed by all the grand jurors, and hence does not have
to be indorsed "A true bill." Martin v. State, 127 Tenn.
324, 155 S.W. 129, 130.
The distinction between a special presentment and a bill
of indictment, even under the old practice, was very thin;
and in Georgia even this distinction has been abolished in
practice for many years. The solicitor is not now required
to frame any indictment on a special presentment, but the
special presentment of the grand jury is returned into
court, and upon it the defendant is arraigned and tried.
It has the same force and effect as a bill of indictment.
The only formal difference between the two is that a prose-
cutor prefers a bill of indictment, and a special present-
ment has no prosecutor, but, in theory, originates with the
grand jury (Progress Club v. State, 12 Ga.App. 174, 76 S.E.
1029, 1030). Even this difference between a bill of indict-
ment and a special presentment no longer exists, and the
finding of the grand jury is prepared by the solicitor-gen-
eral and called a bill of indictment, or a special present-
ment, at his will. Head v. State, 32 Ga.App. 331, 123 S.E.
Negotiable Instruments
The production of a bill of exchange to the
drawee for his acceptance, or to the drawer or
acceptor for payment; or of a promissory note to
the party liable, for payment of the same.

## PRESENTS

The present instrument. The
phrase "these presents" is used in any legal docu-
ment to designate the instrument in which the
phrase itself occurs.

## PRESERVATION

Keeping safe from harm;
avoiding injury, destruction, or decay. This term
always presupposes a real or existing danger.
State ex rel. Pollock v. Becker, 289 Mo. 660, 233
S.W. 641, 649. It is not creation, but the saving
of that which already exists, and implies the con-
tinuance of what previously existed. McKeon v.
Central Stamping Co., C.C.A.N.J., 264 F. 385, 387.

## PRESERVE

With reference to foodstuffs, to pre-
pare in such a manner as to resist decomposition
or fermentation; to prevent from spoiling by the
use of preservative substances with or without
the use of the agency of heat. U. S. v. Dodson,
D.C.Cal., 268 F. 397, 403. The word "preserved,"
when applied to meat, implies that it has been so
processed that its preservation is of permanent
character. U. S. v. Conkey & Co., 12 Ct.Cust.App.
552, 554.

## PRESIDE

To occupy the place of authority or
of president, chairman, moderator, etc., to direct,
control or regulate proceedings as chief officer or
to preside at public meetings, to preside over the
senate. Drake v. Drake, 187 Ga. 423, 1 S.E.2d
573, 575. To preside over a court is to "hold" it,—
to direct, control, and govern it as the chief officer.
A judge may "preside" whether sitting as a sole
judge or as one of several judges. Smith v. Peo-
ple, 47 N.Y. 334.

## PRESIDENT

One placed in authority over oth-
ers; a chief officer; a presiding or managing of-
ficer; a governor, ruler, or director. The chair-
man, moderator, or presiding officer of a legisla-
tive or deliberative body, appointed to keep order,
manage the proceedings, and govern the admin-
istrative details of their business.
The chief officer of a corporation, company,
board, committee, etc., generally having the main
direction and administration of their concerns.
Roe v. Bank of Versailles, 167 Mo. 406, 67 S.W.
303. The term does not ordinarily include "vice
president." First Nat. Bank v. C. H. Meyers &
Co., Tex.Civ.App., 283 S.W. 265, 266.
The chief executive magistrate of a state or na-
tion, particularly under a democratic form of gov-
ernment; or of a province, colony, or dependency,
In the United States, the word is commonly used in ref
erence to the private as well as public character of the
nation's chief executive. U. S. v. Metzdorf, D.C.Mont., 252
F. 933, 937.
In English law. A title formerly given to the
king's lieutenant in a province; as the president
of Wales. Cowell.
This word is also an old though corrupted form
of "precedent," (q. v.,) used both as a French and
English word. Le president est rare. Dyer, 136.

## PRESIDENT JUDGE

A title sometimes given to
the presiding judge. It was formerly used in
England and is now used in the courts of common
court of appeals. The lord chief justice is now
permanent president of the high court of justice
in England. The title president is said to have a
high Norman flavor. Inderwick, King's Peace
PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL. In English law.
A great officer of state; a member of the cabinet.
He attends on the sovereign, proposes business at
the council-table, and reports to the sovereign the
transactions there. 1 Bl. Comm. 230.

## PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

The
official title of the chief executive officer of the
federal government in the United States.

## PRESIDENTIAL ELECTORS

A body of electors
chosen in the different states, whose sole duty it
is to elect a president and vice-president of the
United States. Each state appoints, in such man-
ner as the legislature thereof may direct, a num-
ber of electors equal to the whole number of sen-
ators and representatives to which the state is
entitled in congress. Const. U. S. art. 2, § 1; Mc-
Pherson v. Blacker, 13 S.Ct. 3, 146 U.S. 1, 36 L.Ed.
869. The usual method of appointment is by gen-
eral ballot, so that each voter in a state votes for
the whole number of electors to which his state
is entitled.

## PRESIDING JUDGE

This term, in statutes re-
quiring exceptions to be signed by the judge who
presides at the trial, means the judge presiding
at the trial of which a review is sought; hence
exceptions saved at a first trial, contained in bill
of exceptions signed by the judge presiding at a
second trial, are not reviewable. Tucker v. Yan-
dow, 100 Vt. 169, 135 A. 600, 601.

## PRESS

navigation in the river Seine. Indemnification
was subsequently made. 1 Halleck, Int. L. Bak-
er's Ed. 520.

## PRESTATION MONEY

A sum of money paid by
archdeacons yearly to their bishop; also purvey-
ance. Cowell.
PRESTIMONY, or PR2ESTIMONIA. In canon
law. A fund or revenue appropriated by the
founder for the subsistence of a priest, without
being erected into any title or benefice, chapel,
prebend, or priory. It is not subject to the ordi-
nary; but of it the patron, and those who have a
right from him, are the collators. Wharton.

## PRESUMABLY

Fit to be assumed as true in ad-
vance of conclusive evidence; credibly deduced;
fair to suppose; by reasonable supposition or in-
ference; what appears to be entitled to belief
without direct evidence. Kurth v. Continental Life
Ins. Co., 234 N.W. 201, 202, 211 Iowa 736; Mitchell
v. Equitable Life Assur. Soc. of U. S., 205 N.C. 726,

## PRESUME

To assume beforehand. Hickman v.
Union Electric Light & Power Co., Mo.Sup., 226
S.W. 570, 576. In a more technical sense, to be-
lieve or accept upon probable evidence. It is not
so strong a word as "infer";` Morford v. Peck, 46
Conn. 385; though often used with substantially
the same meaning; State v. Schuck, 51 N.D. 875,
201 N.W. 342, 345.
PRESUMPTICO, See Prtesumptio; Presumption.

## PRESUMPTION

Of fact. An inference affirma-
tive or disaffirmative of the truth or falsehood of
any proposition or fact drawn by a process of
probable reasoning in the absence of actual cer-
tainty of its truth or falsehood, or until such cer-
tainty can be ascertained. Best, Pres. § 3.
An inference affirmative or disaffirmative of the existence
of a disputed fact, drawn by a judicial tribunal, by a
process of probable reasoning, from some one or more mat-
ters of fact, either admitted in the cause or otherwise satis-
factorily established. Best, Pres. § 12. An inference as to
the existence of a fact not known, arising from its con-
nection with the facts that are known, and founded upon a
knowledge of human nature and the motives which are
known to influence human conduct. Hawes v. State of
Georgia, 42 S.Ct. 204, 258 U.S. 1, 66 L.Ed. 431. An infer-
ence as to the existence of some fact drawn from the exist-
ence of some other fact; an inference which common sense
draws from circumstances usually occurring in such cases.
1 Phil.Ev. 436; 3 B. & Ad. 890. A strong probability or
reasonable supposition. In re Van Tassell's Will, 196
N.Y.S. 491, 494, 119 Misc. 478. That which may be assumed
without proof or taken for granted as self-evident result
of human reason and experience. Watkins v. Prudential
Ins. Co. of America, 315 Pa. 497, 173 A. 644, 647, 95 A.L.R.
A conclusion reached by means of the weight of proved
circumstances. Marquet v. AzEtna Life Ins. Co., 128 Tenn.
213, 159 S.W. 733, 736, L.R.A.1915B, 749, Ann.Cas.1915B,
Presumptions of fact are not the subject of fixed rules,
but are merely natural presumptions, such as appear, from
common experience, to arise from the particular circum-
stances of any case. Some of these are "founded upon a
knowledge of the human character, and of the motives,
passions, and feelings by which the mind is usually in-
fluenced." 1 Stark. Ev. 27. They may be said to be the
conclusions drawn by the mind from the natural connec-
tion of the circumstances disclosed in each case, or, In
Of Law. A rule of law that courts and judges
shall draw a particular inference from a particular
fact, or from particular evidence, unless and un-
til the truth of such inference is disproved. Steph.
Ev. 4; Lane v. Missouri Pac. Ry. Co., 132 Mo. 4,
33 S.W. 645. A rule which, in certain cases, either
forbids or dispenses with any ulterior inquiry. 1
Greenl. § 14.
A consequence which the law or the judge draws from a
known fact to a fact unknown. In re Cowdry's Will, 77 Vt.
359, 60 A. 141, 142. A rule of law laid down by the judge
and attaching to evidentiary facts certain procedural con-
sequences as to the duty of production of other evidence by
the opponent. If the opponent does offer evidence to the
contrary, the presumption disappears, and the case stands
upon the facts and the reasonable inferences to be drawn
therefrom. Kramer v. Nichols-Chandler Home Building &
Brokerage Co., 103 Okl. 208, 229 P. 767, 768. A conclusion,
which, in the absence of evidence upon the exact question,
the law draws from other proof made or from facts judi-
cially noticed or both, the burden of proof cast by it being
satisfied by the presentation of evidence sufficient to con-
vince the jury that the probabilities of truth are against
the party whom the presumption relieves of the burden of
proof. State ex rel. Detroit Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v.
Ellison, 268 Mo. 239, 187 S.W. 23, 26. Presumptions of law
are divided into conclusive presumptions and disputable
presumptions.
A conclusive presumption, called also an "absolute" or
"irrebuttable" presumption, is a rule of law determining
the quantity of evidence requisite for the support of a
particular averment which is not permitted to be overcome
by any proof that the fact is otherwise. 1 Greenl.Ev. § 15;
U. S. v. Clark, 5 Utah, 226, 14 P. 288. It is an inference
which the court will draw from the proof, which no evi-
dence, however strong, will be permitted to overturn.
Lyon v. Guild, 5 Heisk., Tenn., 175, 182; Best, Pres. § 20.
A disputable presumption, called also an "inconclusive"
or "rebuttable" presumption, is an inference of law which
holds good until it is invalidated by proof or a stronger
presumption. Best, Pres. § 29; Livingston v. Livingston,
4 Johns.Ch., N.Y., 287, 8 Am.Dec. 562.
Mixed. There are also certain mixed presump-
tions, or presumptions of fact recognized by law,
or presumptions of mixed law and fact. These
are certain presumptive inferences, which, from
their strength, importance, or frequent occur-
rence, attract, as it were, the observation of the
law. The presumption of a "lost grant" falls with-
in this class. Best, Ev. 436. See Dickson v. Wil-
kinson, 3 How. 57, 11 L.Ed. 491.
Distinction. The distinctions between presump-
tions of law and presumptions of fact are, first,
that in regard to presumptions of law a certain in-
ference must be made whenever the facts appear
which furnish the basis of the inference; while
in case of other presumptions a discretion more or
less extensive is vested in the tribunal as to draw..
ing the inference. 9 B. & C. 643. Second, in case.
of presumptions of law, the court may draw the
inference whenever the requisite facts are devel-
oped in pleading; Steph. Pl. 382; while other pre-
sumptions can be made only by the intervention
of a jury. Presumptions of law are reduced to
fixed rules, and form a part of the system of juris-
prudence to which they belong; presumptions of
fact are derived wholly and directly from the cir-
cumstances of the particular case, by means of
the common experience of mankind. 2 Stark. Ev.
684; Douglass v. Mitchell's Ex'r, 35 Pa. 440.
It has been suggested as the characteristic distinction
either simple or mixed, that when the former are disre-
garded by a jury, a new trial is granted as matter of right,
but that the disregard of any of the latter, however strong
and obvious, is only ground for a new trial at the discre-
tion of the court; Chamb.Best, Ev. § 327; 1 Term 167;
Turnley v. Black, 44 Ala. 159; Goggans v. Monroe, 31 Ga.
331. A presumption of law is a juridical postulate that a
particular predicate is universally assignable to a particu-
lar subject. A presumption of fact is a logical argument
from a fact to a fact; or, as the distinction is sometimes
put, it is an argument which infers a fact otherwise doubt-
ful from a fact which is proved. 2 Whart.Ev. § 1226;
Smith v. Gardner, 36 Neb. 741, 55 N.W. 245.
Presumptions are divided into prcesumptiones
juris et de jure, otherwise called "irrebuttable
presumptions," (often, but not necessarily, ficti-
tious,) which the law will not suffer to be rebutted
by any counter-evidence; as, that an infant under
seven years is not responsible for his actions;
prcesumptiones juris tantum, which hold good in
the absence of counter-evidence, but against which
counter-evidence may be admitted; and prcesump-
tiones hominis, which are not necessarily conclu-
sive, though no proof to the contrary be adduced.
Mozley & Whiteley.
A natural presumption is that species of pre-
sumption, or process of probable reasoning, which
is exercised by persons of ordinary intelligence,
in inferring one fact from another, without ref-
erence to any technical rules. Otherwise called
"prcesumptio hominis." Burrill, Circ. Ev. 11, 12,
22, 24.
Legitimate presumptions have been denominat-
ed "violent" or "probable," according to the
amount of weight which attaches to them. Such
presumptions as are drawn from inadequate
grounds are termed "light" or "rash" presump-
tions. Brown.
Evidence and Presumptions
Presumptions are evidence or have the effect of
evidence. Brill v. Brill, 38 Cal.App.2d 741, 102 P.
2d 534, 537. Westberg v. Willde, 14 Ca1.2d 360,
94 P.2d 590, 593.
Examples are disputable presumptions. Clary v. Lind-
ley, 30 Cal.App.2d 571, 86 P.2d 920, 921; Equitable Life

179 A. 753, 754; Allstaedt v. Ochs, 302 Mich. 232, 4 N.W.2d
530, 532.
A presumption is a substitute for evidence, Siler v. Siler,
152 Tenn. 379, 277 S.W. 886, 887; U. S. ex rel. Scharlon v.
Pulver, C.C.A.N.Y., 54 F.2d 261, 263; but is not itself evi-
dence, being rather an aid to legal reasoning applied to
particular subjects; Van Ausdall v. Van Ausdall, 48 R.I.
106, 135 A. 850, 851. It is a rule about the duty of produc-
ing evidence. Duggan v. Bay State St. Ry. Co., 230 Mass.
370, 119 N.E. 757, 760, L.R.A.1918E, 680; 4 Wigm.Ev. §§
2490, 2491, 2511. Presumptions will serve in the place of
"evidence". Bohmont v. Moore, 138 Neb. 784, 295 N.W.
419, 424. While presumptions, in tort actions, that auto-
mobile was in possession of owner at time of accident and
that taxicab was being operated in usual course of cab
company's business, are not "evidence," they serve as evi-
dence in proper case until overcome by competent evidence
to contrary. Van Court v. Lodge Cab Co., 198 Wash. 530,
89 P.2d 206, 211.

## PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE

Conclusion
drawn by law in favor of one brought to trial on
criminal charge, requiring acquittal unless guilt
is established by sufficient evidence. Blim v. Unit-
ed States, C.C.A.Ill., 68 F.2d 484, 487.

## PRESUMPTION OF SURVIVORSHIP

A pre-
sumption of fact, to the effect that one person
survived another, applied for the purpose of de-
termining a question of succession or similar mat-
ter, in a case where the two persons perished in
the same catastrophe, and there are no circum-
stances extant to show which of them actually
died first, except those on which the presumption
is founded, viz., differences of age, sex, strength,
or physical condition.

## PRESUMPTIVE

Resting on presumption; cre-
ated by or arising out of presumption; inferred;
assumed; supposed; as, "presumptive" damages,
evidence, heir, notice, or title. See those titles.

## PRESUMPTIVE EVIDENCE

This term has sev-
(1) Any evidenee which is not direct and positive; the
proof of minor or other facts incidental to or usually con-
nected with the fact sought to be proved which, when tak-
en together, inferentially establish or prove the fact in
question to a reasonable degree of certainty; evidence
drawn by human experience from the connection of cause
and effect and observation of human conduct; the proof
of facts from which, with more or less certainty, according
to the experience of mankind of their more or less uni-
versal connection, the existence of other facts can be de-
duced. In this sense the term is nearly equivalent to "cir-
cumstantial"' evidence. See 1 Starkie, Ev. 558; 2 Saund.
Pl. & Ev. 673; State v. Kornstett, 62 Kan. 221, 61 P. 805,
808; Ezzard v. U. S., C.C.A.Okl., 7 F.2d 808, 810. Best
says presumptive evidence is as original as direct, and that
presumption of a fact is as good as any other proof when
it is legitimate. Jones v. Granite State Fire Ins. Co., 90
Me. 40, 37 A. 326, 328. "Circumstantial evidence" is some-
times used as synonymous with presumptive evidence, but
not with strict accuracy; for presumptive evidence is not
necessarily and in all cases what is usually understood by
circumstantial evidence. See 1 Stark.Ev. 478; Whart.Ev.
1, 2, 15. The word presumption imports an inference from
facts known, based upon previous experience of the ordi-
nary connection between the two, and, the word itself im-
plies a certain relation between fact and inference. Cir-
cumstances, however, generally but not necessarily lead to
particular inferences; for the facts may be indisputable,
and yet their relation to the principal fact may be only
apparent, not real; and even where the connection is real,
the deduction may be erroneous. Circumstantial and pre-
sumptive evidence differ therefore as genus and species.
Will, Cir.Ev. 17.
(2) Evidence which must be received and treated as true
and sufficient until rebutted by other testimony; as, where
a , statute provides that certain facts shall be presumptive
evidence of guilt, of title, etc. State v. Mitchell, 119 N.C.
784, 25 S.E. 783; State v. Intoxicating Liquors, 80 Me. 57,
12 A. 794.
(3) Also, it means evidence that admits of explanation or
contradiction by other evidence, as distinguished from con-
clusive evidence. Burrill, Circ. Ev. 89. "Presumptive evi-
dence" is synonymous with prima facie evidence. State v.
Simon, 163 Minn. 317,. 203 N.W. 989, 990; Watson v. Rol-
lins, 18 Ala. App. 125, 90 So. 60, 61. See, also, Presump-
tion; Prima Fade Evidence.

## PRET A INTEAT

Loan at interest. A con-
tract by which one of the parties delivers to the
other a sum of money, or commodities, or other
,
movable or fungible things, to receive for their
use a profit determined in favor of the lender.

## PRAT A USAGE

Loan to use. A contract by
which one of the parties delivers an article to the
other, to be used by the latter, the borrower agree-
ing to return the specific article after having used.
it. Duverger. A contract identical with the com-
modatum (q. v.) of the civil law.
PRtT DE CONSOMMATION. Loan for consump-
tion. A contract by which one party delivers to
the other a certain quantity of things, such as

contract identical with the mutuum (q. v.) of the
civil law.
PRRTE—NOM. One who lends his name. Peter-
PRETEND. To feign or simulate; to hold that
out as real which is false or baseless. Brown v.
Perez, Tex.Civ.App., 25 S.W. 983; King v. U. S.,
C.C.A.Fla., 279 F. 103. As to the rule against the
buying and selling of "any pretended right or
title," see Pretensed Right or Title.

## PRETENSE

See False Pretenses.

## PRETENSED, or PRETENDED, TITLE STAT- UTE

The English statute 32 Hen. VIII. c. 9, § 2.
It enacts that no one shall sell or purchase any
pretended right or title to land, unless the vendor
has received the profits thereof for one whole
year before such grant, or has been in actual pos-
session of the land, or of the reversion or remaind-
er, on pain that both purchaser and vendor shall
each forfeit the value of such land to the king and
the prosecutor. See 4 Broom & H. Comm. 150.
PRETENSED RIGHT or TITLE. Where one is
in possession of land, and another, who is out of
possession, claims and sues for it. Here the pre-
tensed right or title is said to be in him who so
claims and sues for the same. Mod. Cas. 302.

## PRETENSES

Allegations sometimes made in a
bill in chancery for the purpose of negativing an
anticipated defense. Hunt, Eq. pt. I. c. 1.
False pretenses. See that title.

## PRETENTION

In French law. The claim made
to a thing which a party believes himself entitled
to demand, but which is not admitted or adjudged
to be his.
The words right, action, and pretention are usually
joined; not that they are synonymous, for'right is some-
thing positive and certain, action is what is demanded,
while pretention is sometimes not even accompanied by a
demand.

## PRETER LEGAL

Not agreeable to law; exceed-
ing the limits of law; not legal.

## PRETERMIT

To "pretermit" is to pass by, to
omit or to disregard, e. g., failure of testator to
mention his children in his will.

## PRETERMITTED HEIR

A child or other de-
scendant omitted by a testator. Where a testa-
tor unintentionally fails to mention in his will,
or make provision for, a child, either living at the
date of the execution of the will or born there-
after, a statute may provide that such child, or
the issue of a deceased child, shall share in the
estate as though the testator had died intestate.
In re Price's Estate, 56 Cal.App.2d 335, 132 P.2d
PRETEXT. Ostensible reason or motive assigned
or assumed as a color or cover for the real reason
or motive; false appearance, pretense. State v.
Ball, 27 Neb. 604, 43 N.W. 398.
In international law. A reason alleged as jus-
tificatory, but which is so only in appearance, or
which is even absolutely destitute of all founda-
tion. The name of "pretexts" may likewise be ap-
plied to reasons which are in themselves true and
well-founded, but, not being of sufficient import-
tional act,] are made use of only to cover am-
bitious views. Vatt. Law Nat. bk. 3, c. 3, § 32.

## PRETIUM

Lat. Price; cost; value; the price
of an article sold.

## PRETIUM AFFECTIONIS

An imaginary value
put upon a thing by the fancy of the owner, and
growing out of his attachment for the specific ar-
ticle, its associations, his sentiment for the donor,
etc. Bell; The H. F. Dimock, C.C.A.Mass., 77 F.
233, 23 C.C.A. 123; Burr v. Bloomsburg, 101 N.J.
Eq. 615, 138 A. 876, 878.
PRETIUM PERICULL The price of the risk, e.
g. the premium paid on a policy of insurance;
also the interest paid on money advanced on bot-
tomry or respondentia.

## PRETIUM SEPULCHRI

A mortuary (q. v.).

## PRETIUM SUCCEDIT IN LOCUM REI

The
price stands in the place of the thing sold. 1 Bouv.

land, a court for the trial of capital crimes, con-
sisting of the lord proprietor or his lieutenant-
general, and the council. Also called Pretorial.
Murray, New English Dict.
PRETORIUM, In Scotch law. A courthouse, or
hall of justice. 3 How. State Tr. 425.

## PREUVE

Fr. "Evidence" in the sense of the
term in English law, and of probatio in the canon
and civil law. The French word evidence, Latin
evidentia, is commonly restricted to the testimony
of the senses. 1 Best, Evid. § 11.

## PREVAIL

To be or become effective or effectual,
to be in force, to obtain, to be in general use or
practice, to be commonly accepted or adopted;
to exist. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Gamble,
155 Fla. 678, 21 So.2d 348, 350.

## PREVAILING PARTY

That one of the parties
to a suit who successfully prosecutes the action
or successfully defends against it, prevailing on
the main issue, even though not to the extent of
his original contention. Weston v. Cushing, 45
Vt. 531; Hawkins v. Nowland, 53 Mo. 329; Hug-
gins v. Hill, Mo.Sup., 236 S.W. 1054, 1055.
The one in whose favor the decision or verdict is ren-
dered and judgment entered. United States v. Minneapo-
lis, St. P. & S. S. M. Ry. Co., D.C.Minn., 235 F. 951, 955;
Dunne v. New York Telephone Co., 176 N.Y.S. 519, 520, 107
Misc. 439; O'Hare v. Peacock Dairies, 28 Cal.App.2d 562,
82 P.2d 1112, 1113. The party ultimately prevailing when
the matter is finally set at rest. Comparri v. James Read-
ding, Inc., 121 N.J.L. 591, 3 A.2d 802, 803. The party pre-
vailing in interest, and not necessarily the prevailing per-
son. Gertz v. Milwaukee Electric Ry. & Light Co., 153
Wis. 475, 140 N.W. 312, 316. To be such does not depend
upon the degree of success at different stages of the suit,
but whether, at the end of the suit, or other proceeding,
the party who has made a claim against the other, has suc-
cessfully maintained it. Bangor & P. R. Co. v. Chamber-
lain, 60 Me. 286. Thus, where the court grants defendant
a new trial after verdict for plaintiff, defendant is the
"prevailing party" on that trial, and entitled to costs, al-
though the plaintiff again gets verdict on retrial. Klock
Produce Co. v. Diamond Ice & Storage Co., 98 Wash. 676,
168 P. 476, 478.

## PREVAILING PRICES

This term, as used in a
came only from one source, means such prices as
were set by that source in the usual course of
business, without undue enlargement of cost, and
with a reasonable profit in addition. New York
Oversea Co. v. China, Japan & South American
Trading Co., 200 N.Y.S. 449, 451, 206 App.Div. 242.

## PREVARICATION

In the civil law. The acting
with unfaithfulness and want of probity; deceit-
ful, crafty, or unfaithful conduct; particularly,
such as is manifested in concealing a crime. Dig.
47, 15, 6.
In English law. A collusion between an inform-
er and a defendant, in order to a feigned prosecu-
tion. Cowell. Any secret abuse committed in a
public office or private commission; willful con-
cealment or misrepresentation of truth, by giving
evasive or equivocating evidence.

## PREVENT

To hinder, frustrate, prohibit, im-
pede, or preclude; to obstruct; to intercept. Burr
v. Williams, 20 Ark. 185; Orme v. Atlas Gas and
Oil Co., 217 Minn. 27, 13 N.W.2d 757, 761. To stop
or intercept the approach, access, or performance
of a thing. Webster, Diet.; U. S. v. Souders, 27
Fed.Cas.1,269; Green v. State, 109 Ga. 536, 35 S.
E. 97.

## PREVENTION

In the civil law. The right of a
judge to take cognizance of an action over which
he has concurrent jurisdiction with another judge.
In canon law. The right which a superior per-
son or officer has to lay hold of, claim, or transact
an affair prior to an inferior one, to whom other-
wise it more immediately belongs. Wharton.

## PREVENTION OF CRIMES ACT

The statute
34 & 35 Vict. c. 112, passed for the purpose of
securing a better supervision over habitual crim-
inals. This act provides that a person who is for
a second time convicted of crime may, on his sec-
ond conviction, be subjected to police supervision
for a period of seven years after the expiration of
the punishment awarded him. Penalties are im-
posed on lodging-house keepers, etc., for harbor-
ing thieves or reputed thieves. There are also
provisions relating to receivers of stolen prop-
erty, and dealers in old metals who purchase the
same in small quantities. This act repeals the
habitual criminals act of 1869, (32 & 33 Vict. c.
99.) Brown.

## PREVENTIVE JUSTICE

The system of meas-
ures taken by government with reference to the
direct prevention of crime. It generally consists
in obliging those persons whom there is probable
ground to suspect of future misbehavior to give
full assurance to the public that such offense as
is apprehended shall not happen, by finding pledg-
es or securities to keep the peace, or for their
good behavior. 4 Bl. Comm. 251; 4 Steph. Comm.
290; Bradley v. Malen, 37 N.D. 295, 164 N.W. 24,
PREVENTIVE SERVICE. The name given in
England to the coast-guard, or armed police, form-
ing a part of the customs service, and employed in
the prevention and detection of smuggling.
or "next preceding." Syracuse Say. Bank v.
Brown, 42 N.Y.S.2d 156, 158, 181 Misc. 999.

## PREVIOUS INTENTIONS ARE JUDGED BY SUBSEQUENT ACTS

Dumont V. Smith, 4 Denio

## (N.Y.) 319, 320, PREVIOUS QUESTION

In parliamentary prac-
tice, the question whether a vote shall be taken
on the main issue, or not, brought forward before
the main or real question is put by the speaker
and for the purpose of avoiding, if the vote is in
the negative, the putting of this question. The
motion is in the form "that the question be now
put," and the mover and seconder vote against it.
It is described in May. Parl, Prac, 277.
In the house of representatives of the United States and
in many state legislatures the object of moving the previ-
ous question is to cut off debate and secure immediately a
vote on the question under consideration. Hinds, Prec-
edents in the House of Repr.

## PREVIOUSLY

A statute of 25
Edw. III. St. 6, for the protection of spiritual pa-

## PRICE

Something which one ordinarily accepts
voluntarily in exchange for something else. Herb
v. Hallowell, 304 Pa. 128, 154 A. 582, 584. The
consideration given for the purchase of a thing;
Hibernia Bank & Trust Co. v. McCall Bros. Plant-
ing & Mfg. Co., 140 La. 763, 73 So. 857, 858;—us-
ually in money; Embden State Bank v. Boyle, 50
N.D. 573, 196 N.W. 820, 821.
For "Fair Market Price," see that title.
Sum of money which an article is sold for; but this is
simply because property is generally sold for money, not
because the word has necessarily such a restricted mean-
ing. Among writers on political economy, who use terms
with philosophical accuracy, the word "price" is not al-
ways or even generally used as denoting the moneyed
equivalent of property sold. They generally treat and re-
gard price as the equivalent or compensation, in whatever
form received, for property sold. The Latin word from
which "price" is derived sometimes means "reward,"
"value," "estimation," "equivalent." Hudson Iron Co. v.
Alger, 54 N.Y. 177. Amount which a prospective seller in-
dicates as the sum for which he is willing to sell; market
value. Ara v. Rutland, Tex.Civ.App., 172 S.W. 993, 994.
The term may be synonymous with cost, Williams v. Hy-
bskmann, 311 Mo. 332, 278 S.W. 377, 379; and with value,
Southeastern Express Co. v. Nightingale, 33 Ga.App. 515,
126 S.E. 915, as well as with consideration, though price is
not always identical either with consideration, Oregon
Home Builders v. Crowley, 87 Or. 517, 170 P. 718, 721; or
with value, Chicago, K. & W. R. Co. v. Parsons, 51 Kan.
408, 32 P. 1083.
"Price" within ceiling price regulations of the Office of
Price Administration is the amount paid by the purchaser.
Boyles v. Stapleton, D.C.Colo., 53 F.Supp. 336, 340.

## PRICE CURRENT

A list or enumeration of var-
ious articles of merchandise, with their prices,
the duties, if any, payable thereon, when imported
or exported, with the drawbacks occasionally al-
lowed upon their exportation, etc. Wharton.

## PRICE DISCRIMINATION

Within anti-trust
laws selling to one at a price and refusing to sell
to sell. Sherman Anti-Trust Act, 15 U.S.C.A. § 1
et seq.; Shaw's v. Wilson-Jones Co., D.C.Pa., 26 F.
Supp, 713, 714,
PRICE EXPECTANCY. In the moving picture
industry, the minimum receipts which distribu-
tors expect to realize from the exhibition of pic-

sale" and "exhibition value." Export & Import
Film Co. v. B. P. Schulberg Productions, 125 Misc,
756, 211 N.Y.S. 838, 839.

## PRICKING FOR SHERIFFS

In England, when
the yearly list of persons nominated for the office
of sheriff is submitted to the sovereign, he takes a
pin, and to insure impartiality, as it is said, lets
the point of it fall upon one of the three names
nominated for each county, etc., and the person
upon whose name it chances to fall is sheriff for
the ensuing year. This is called "pricking for
sheriffs." Atk. Sher. 18.

## PRICKING NOTE

Where goods intended to be
exported are put direct from the station of the
warehouse into a ship alongside, the exporter fills
up a document to authorize the receiving the
goods on board. This document is called a "prick-
ing note," from a practice of pricking holes in the
paper corresponding with the number of pack-
ages counted into the ship. Hamel, Cust. 181.

## PRIDE GAVEL

A rent or tribute. Tayl. Gav-
elk. 112.

## PRIEST

A minister of a church. A person in
the second order of the ministry, as distinguished
from bishops and deacons.
A pastor is a permanent official of a parish, and more
than a priest, who holds a position of spiritual power with-
out reference to locality. Dupont v. Pettelier, 120 Me. 114,
113 A. 11, 13.
PRIMA_FACIE, Lat. At first sight; on the first
appearance; on the face of it; so far as can be
judged from the first disclosure; presumably;
a fact presumed to be true unless disproved by
some evidence to the contrary. State ex rel. Her-
bert v. Whims, 68 Ohio App. 39, 38 N.E.2d 596,
PRIMA FACIE CASE. Such as will suffice until
contradicted and overcome by other evidence. Pa-
cific Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Wallace, 158
Or. 210, 75 P.2d 942, 947. A case which has pro-
ceeded upon sufficient proof to that stage where
it will support finding if evidence to contrary is
disregarded. In re Hoagland's Estate, 126 Neb.
377, 253 N.W. 416.
A litigating party is said to have a prima facie case
when the evidence in his favor is sufficiently strong for his
opponent to be called on to answer it. A prima facie case,
then, is one which is established by sufficient evidence, and
can be overthrown only by rebutting evidence adduced on
the other side. In some cases the only question to be con-
sidered is whether there is a prima facie case or no. Thus
a grand jury are bound to find a true bill of indictment, if
the evidence before them creates a prima facie case against
the accused; and for this purpose, therefore, it is not nec-
essary for them to hear the evidence for the defense. Moz-
ley & Whitley. And see State v. Hardelein, 169 Mo. 579,
70 S.W. 130; State v. Lawlor, 28 Minn. 216, 9 N.W. 698.

## PRIMA FACIE EVIDENCE

Evidence good and
sufficient on its face; such evidence as, in the
ing the party's claim or defense, and which if not
rebutted or contradicted, will remain sufficient.
State v. Burlingame, 146 Mo. 207, 48 S.W. 72.
Evidence which suffices for the proof of a particular fact
until contradicted and overcome by other evidence. Dod-
son v. Watson, 110 Tex. 355, 220 S.W. 771, 772, 11 A.L.R.
583. Evidence which, standing alone and unexplained,
would maintain the proposition and warrant the conclu-
sion to support which it is introduced. Gilmore v. Modern
Brotherhood of America, 186 Mo.App. 445, 171 S.W. 629,
632. An inference or presumption of law, affirmative or
negative of a fact, in the absence of proof, or until proof
can be obtained or produced to overcome the inference.
People v. Thacher, 1 Thomp. & C., N.Y., 167. A litigating
party is said to have a prima facie case when the evidence
in his favor is sufficiently strong for his opponent to be
called on to answer it. A prima facie case, then, is one
which is established by sufficient evidence, and can be
overthrown only by rebutting evidence adduced on the
other side. Mozley & Whitley. State v. Lawlor, 28 Minn.
216, 9 N.W. 698. A "prima facie case" is one which is
apparently established by evidence adduced by plaintiff in
support of his case up to the time such evidence stands
unexplained and uncontradicted. Morrison v. Flowers, 308
Ill. 189, 139 N.E. 10, 12. A "prima facie case" is one in
which the evidence in favor of a proposition is sufficient to
support a finding in its favor, if all of the evidence to the
contrary be disregarded. Schallert v. Boggs, Tex.Civ.App.,
204 S.W. 1061, 1062. See, also, Presumptive Evidence.

## PRIMA PARS ZEQUITATIS )EQUALITAS

The
radical element of equity is equality.

## PRIMA TONSURA

The first mowing; a grant
of a right to have the first crop of grass. 1 Chit.
Pr. 181.

## PRIMIE IMPRESSIONIS

A case primce impres-
sionis (of the first impression) is a case of a new
kind, to which no established principle of law or
precedent directly applies, and which must be de-
cided entirely by reason as distinguished from au-
thority.

## PRIME PRECES

Lat. In the civil law. An im-
perial prerogative by which the emperor exercised
the right of naming to the first prebend that be-
came vacant after his accession, in every church
of the empire. 1 Bl. Comm. 381.

## PRIMAGE

In mercantile law. Formerly, a
small allowance or compensation payable to the
master and mariners of a ship or vessel; to the
former for the use of his cables and ropes to dis-
charge the goods of the merchant; to the latter
for lading and unlading in any port or haven.
Abb. Shipp. 404; Peters v. Speights, 4 Md. Ch.
381; Blake v. Morgan, 3 Mart. 0. S. (La.) 381.
It is sometimes called the master's hat-money.
It is no longer, however, a gratuity to the master, unless
especially stipulated; but it belongs to the owners or
freighters, and is nothing but an increase of the freight
rate. Carr v. Austin & N. W. R. Co., C.C.Tex., 14 F. 419.

## PRIMARIA ECCLESIA

The mother church. 1
Steph. Comm. (7th Ed.) 118.

## PRIMARY

tention. State v. Erickson, 44 S.D. 63, 182 N.W.
315, 316, 13 A.L.R. 1189.
As to primary "Conveyance," "Election," "Obli-
gation," and "Vein," see those titles.

## PRIMARY ALLEGATION

The opening pleading
in a suit in the ecclesiastical court. It is also
PRIMARY DISPOSAL OF THE SOIL. In acts
of congress admitting territories as states, and
providing that no laws shall be passed interfering
with the primary disposal of the soil, this means
the disposal of it by the United States govern-
ment when it parts with its title to private per-
sons or corporations acquiring the right to a pat-
ent or deed in accordance with law. See Oury v.
Goodwin, 3 Ariz. 255, 26 P. 377; Topeka Commer-
cial Security Co. v. McPherson, 7 Okl. 332, 54 P.

## PRIMARY EVIDENCE

That kind of evidence
which, under every possible circumstance, affords
the greatest certainty of the fact in question.
Thus, a written instrument is itself the best possi-
ble evidence of its existence and contents.
Primary evidence means original or first-hand evidence;
the best evidence that the nature of the case admits of ;
the evidence which is required in the first instance, and
which must fail before secondary evidence can be admitted.
That evidence which the nature of the case or question sug-
gests as the proper means of ascertaining the truth. See
Cross v. Baskett, 17 Or. 84, 21 P. 47; Scott v. State, 3 Tex.
App. 103, 104. It is the particular means of proof which
is the most natural and satisfactory of which the case
admits, and includes the best evidence which is available
to a party and procurable under the existing situation, and
all evidence falling short of such standard, and which in
its nature suggests there is better evidence of the same
fact, is "secondary evidence." Best v. Equitable Life
Assur. Soc., Mo.App., 299 S.W. 118, 120. See, also, Best
Evidence.

## PRIMARY POWERS

The principal authority
given by a principal to his agent. It differs from

tention; which is fundamental. State v. Erick-
son, 44 S.D. 63, 182 N.W. 315, 317, 13 A.L.R. 1189.
The principal or fixed intention with which an act
or course of conduct is undertaken. Carlson v.
Carpenter Contractors' Ass'n, 224 Ill.App. 430,
PRIMATE. A chief ecclesiastic; an archbishop
who has jurisdiction over his province, or one of
several metropolitans presiding over others. Ex-
arch comes nearest to it in the Greek church.
Thus the archbishop of Canterbury is styled "Pri-
mate of all England;" the archbishop of York is
"Primate of England." Wharton.

## PRIME

In French law. The price of the risk
assumed by an insurer; premium of insurance.
Emerig. Traite des Assur. c. 3, § 1, nn. 1, 2.

## PRIME

To stand first or paramount; to take
precedence or priority of; to outrank; as, in the

ages, 2 Mas. 53, Fed.Cas.No.16,303.

## PRIME MINISTER

ministry or executive government, especially of a
monarchical government. Webster, Dict. In Eng-
land, he is the head of the cabinet, and usually
holds the office of First Lord of the Treasury. The
office was unknown to the law until 1906, when
order of precedence. Lowell, Gov. of Engl. 68.
"He is the principal executive of the British con-
stitution, and the sovereign a cog in the mechan-
ism." Bagehot.

cipe called a "writ of covenant," there was due
to the crown, by ancient prerogative, a primer
fine, or a noble for every five marks of land sued
for. That was one-tenth of the annual value. 1
Steph. Comm. (7th Ed.) 560.

## PRIMER SEISIN

As to principal "Challenge," "Contract," "Obli-
gation," "Office," and "Vein," see those titles.

domicile, the principal domestic establishment.
Mosely v. Dabezies, 142 La. 256, 76 So. 705, 706.

A superintendent, as of a school district. Wil-
liams v. School Dist. No. 189, 104 Wash. 659, 177
tion, as distinguished from Interest or other ad-
ditions to it. Christian v. Superior Court, 122
Cal. 117, 54 P. 518. The corpus or capital of an
estate in contradistinction to the income; "in-
come" being merely the fruit of capital. Carter

Criminal Law
A chief actor or perpetrator, or an alder and
abettor actually or constructively present at the
commission of the crime, as distinguished from
an "accessory." At common law, a principal in
the first degree is he that is the actor or absolute
perpetrator of the crime; and, in the second de-
gree, he who is present, aiding and abetting the
fact to be done. 4 Bl. Comm. 34. Cooney v. Burke,
11 Neb. 258, 9 N.W. 57.
Neither a principal in the first degree nor one in the
second degree need be actually present when the offense is
consummated, Smith v. State, 21 Tex.App. 107, 17 S.W.
552; State v. Morey, 126 Me. 323, 138 A. 474, 475; for the
presence of a principal in the second degree may be mere-
ly constructive; e. g., where he stays outside and keeps
watch or guard, Pierce v. State, 130 Tenn. 24, 168 S.W.
851, 855, Ann.Cas.1916B, 137. In misdemeanors, anyone
participating is a principal, Boggs v. Commonwealth, 218
Ky. 782, 292 S.W. 324, 325.
All persons acting together in, commission of offense, and
persons advising or agreeing to commission thereof and
present when committed, though not aiding therein, are
principals. Stringfellow v. State, 111 Tex.Cr.R. 504, 14
S.W.2d 1031, 1032. A criminal offender is either a prin-
cipal or an accessory. A principal is either the actor (i. e.,
the actual perpetrator of the crime) or else is present,
aiding and abetting, the fact to be done; an accessory is
he who is not the chief actor in the offense, nor yet present
at its performance, but is some way concerned therein,
either before or after the fact committed. 1 Hale, P.C.
613, 618; People v. Ah Gee, 37 Cal.App. 1, 174 P. 371, 372.
All persons concerned in the commission of crime, whether
it be felony or misdemeanor, and whether they directly
commit the act constituting the offense, or aid and abet
in its commission, though not present, are principals.
State v. Curtis, 30 Idaho 537, 165 P. 999, 1000. Some of
these statutes, and other similar ones, expressly abrogate
the common-law distinction between a principal and an
accessory before the fact. People v. Wood, 56 Cal.App.
431, 205 P. 698. All persons are principals who are guilty
of acting together in the commission of an offense. Ver-
non's Ann.P.C. art. 66. A principal is one who advises or
agrees to the commission of an offense, and is present
when it is done. Vernon's Ann.P.C. art. 69. See Pizana v.
State, 81 Tex.Cr.R. 81, 193 S.W. 671, 673; Middleton v.
State, 86 Tex.Cr.R. 307, 217 S.W. 1046, 1052. "Accomplice,"
by virtue of statute in Vernon's Ann.P.C. art. 70, means
one who is not present at the commission of the offense,
Serrato v. State, 74 Tex.Cr.R. 413, 171 S.W. 1133, 1144, and
is practically synonymous with the common-law accessory
before the fact. McKeen v. State, 7 Tex.Cr.R. 631; Strong
v. State, 52 Tex.Cr.R. 13.3, 105 S.W. 785. But the ordinary
meaning of "accomplice" includes all the particeps crim-
inis, whether principals in the first or second degree or
mere accessories. It means one who at common law might
have been convicted either as principal or accessory before
the fact. People v. Crossman, 241 N.Y. 138, 149 N.E. 330,
Law of Agency
The employer or constitutor of an agent; the
person who gives authority to an agent or at-
torney to do some act for him. Adams v. Whit-
tlesey, 3 Conn. 567. Called also constituent or
chief. Mech. Agency § 3. One, who, being com-
petent sui juris to do any act for his own benefit
or on his own account, confides it to another per-
Law of Guaranty and Suretyship
The person primarily liable, for whose perform-
ance of his obligation the guarantor or surety has
become bound. See Rollings v. Gunter, 211 Ala.
671, 101 So. 446, 448.
Old English Law
An heir-loom, mortuary, or corse-present.
Wharton.
Property Law
A term used as the correlative of "accessory"
or "incident" to denote the more important or
valuable subject, with which others are connected
in a relation of dependence or subservience, or
to which they are incident or appurtenant. Thus,
it is said that the incident shall pass by the grant
of the principal; but not the principal by the grant
of the incident. Co. Litt. 152a.
General
Principal of the house. In, English law. The
chief person in some of the inns of chancery.
Undisclosed principal. One not disclosed in the
contract. Unruh v. Roemer, 135 Minn. 127, 160
N.W. 251, 252.
Vice principal. In the law of master and serv-
ant, this term means one to whom the employer
has confided the entire charge of the business or
of a distinct branch of it, giving him authority to
superintend, direct, and control the workmen and
make them obey his orders, the master himself
exercising no particular oversight and giving no
particular orders, or one to whom the master has
delegated a duty of his own, which is a direct,
personal, and absolute obligation. Durkin v.
Kingston Coal Co., 171 Pa. 193, 33 A. 237, 29 L.R.
A. 808, 50 Am.St.Rep. 801.
The term "vice principal," as used in the fellow-servant
law, includes any servant who represents the master in
the discharge of those personal or absolute duties which
every master owes to his servants; such duties being often
referred to as the nonassignable duties of the master,
among which are, providing suitable machinery and ap-
pliances, a safe place to work, the proper inspection and
repair of premises and appliances, the selection and re-
tention of suitable servants, the establishment of proper
rules and regulations, and the instruction of servants as
to the kind and manner of work to be done by them. In-
ternational Cotton Mills v. Webb, 22 Ga.App. 309, 96 S.E.
16; Wolverine Oil Co. v. Kingsbury, 66 Okl. 271, 168 P.
1021, 1022. To make a servant a vice principal, it is only
necessary that he have authority to direct and supervise
the work and to hire and discharge subordinate servants
engaged in the work. Modern Order of Praetorians v. Nel-
son, Tex.Civ.App., 162 S.W. 17, 18; Daggett v. American
Car & Foundry Co., Mo.App., 284 S.W. 855, 856. However,
a servant may be a vice principal, though he has no power
to employ and discharge men under him. Wilson v. Coun-
sell, 182 Ill.App. 79, 84.

## PRINCIPALIS

Lat. Principal; a principal
debtor; a principal in a crime.
PRINCIPALIS DEBET SEMPER EXCUTI AN.
TEQUAM PERVENIATUR AD FIDEIJUSSORES.
The principal should always be exhausted before
coming upon the sureties. 2 Inst. 19.
PRINCIPIA DATA SEQUUNTUR CONCOMI.

## TANTIA

Given principles are followed by their
PRINCIPIA PROBANT, NON PROBANTUR.
Principles prove; they are not proved. Funda-
mental principles require no proof; or, in Lord
Coke's words, "they ought to be approved, be-
cause they cannot be proved." 3 Coke, 50a.

## PRINCIPIIS OBSTA

Withstand beginnings;
oppose a thing in its early stages, if you would
do so with success. Branch, Princ.

## PRINCIPIORUM NON EST RATIO

There is no
reasoning of principles; no argument is required
to prove fundamental rules. 2 Bulst. 239.

## PRINCIPIUM EST POTISSIMA PARS CUJUS- QUE REI

10 Coke, 49. The principle of any-
thing is its most powerful part.

## PRINCIPLE

A fundamental truth or doctrine, as
of law; a comprehensive rule or doctrine which
furnishes a basis or origin for others; a settled
rule of action, procedure, or legal determination.
A truth or proposition so clear that it cannot be
proved or contradicted unless by a proposition
which is still clearer. That which constitutes the
essence of a body or its constituent parts. 8 Term
107. That which pertains to the theoretical part
of a science. Hemler v. Richland Parish School
Board, 142 La. 133, 76 So. 585, 587.
In patent law. The principle of a machine is
the particular means of producing a given result
by a mechanical contrivance. Parker v. Stiles,
5 McLean 44, 63, Fed.Cas.No.10,749. It is the
modus operandi, or that which applies, modifies,
or combines mechanical powers to produce a cer-
tain result; and, so far, a principle, if new in its
application to a useful purpose, may be patent-
able. Barrett v. Hall, 1 Mason, 470, Fed.Cas.No.
1,047. The word "principles," as applied to in-
ventions, designate those elements which in com-
bination compose the claims. Schweyer Electric
& Mfg. Co. v. Regan Safety Devices Co., C.C.A.
N.Y., 4 F.2d 970, 973.

## PRINT

Wyo. 66, 146 P. 593, L.R.A. 1915D, 1084.
The term properly refers to the mechanical work of

from the place where printed. In re Monrovia Evening
Post, 199 Cal. 263, 248 P. 1017, 1018; In re McDonald, 187
Cal. 158, 201 P. 110, 111. But a finding that a newspaper
is "published" in a certain county may be deemed suffi-
cient to show that it was "printed" in such county. Mc-
Cormick v. Higgins, 190 Ill.App. 241, 261. Similarly, a
requirement that matter be "printed" in a particular coun-
ty may be construed as a direction that it be "published"
there. In re Publication of Docket of Supreme Court, Mo.
Sup., 232 S.W. 454, 455.

## PRINTING

The impress of letters or characters
upon paper, or upon other substance;—implying

F. 205, 210.

## PRIOR TEMPORE POTIOR JURE

Broom, Max. 354, 358; 2 P. Wms. 491; 1 Term
733; 9 Wheat. 24, 6 L.Ed. 23; 15 A. (Pa.) 730.

## PRIORI PETENTI

To the person first apply-
ing. In probate practice, where there are several
persons equally entitled to a grant of administra-
tion, (e. g., next of kin of the same degree,) the
rule of the court is to make the grant priori pe-
tenti, to the first applicant. Browne, Prob. Pr.
174; Coote, Prob. Pr. 173, 180.

## PRISON

A public building or other place for

Sturtevant v. Com., 158 Mass. 598, 33 N.E. 648;
Copeland v. Commonwealth, 214 Ky. 209, 282 S.W.
The words "prison" and "penitentiary" are used synony-
mously to designate institutions for the imprisonment of
persons convicted of the more serious crimes, as distin-
guished from reformatories and county or city jails. State
v. Delmonto, 110 Conn. 298, 147 A. 825, 826.
Originally it was distinguished from jail, which was a
place for confinement, not for punishment, and the popular
modern tendency is to use the term in contradistinction to
jail, to denote particularly a state penitentiary. Copeland
v. Commonwealth, 282 S.W. 1077,. 214 Ky. 209. But the
term may also properly apply to a county jail. State v.
Killian, 173 N.C. 792, 92 S.E. 499, 501.
As used in a statute pertaining to escapes, the word may
include territory outside a state prison, where an inmate,

lawful custody by a third person. 2 Bish. Crim.
Law, § 1065.
PRISONAM FRANGENTIBUS, STATUTE DE.

break prison, but misdemeanor only for a misde-
meanant to do so. 1 Hale, P. C. 612.

## PRISONER

950. A person restrained of his liberty upon any
action, civil or criminal, or upon commandment.
Cowell.
A person on trial for crime. "The prisoner at the bar."
The jurors are told to "look upon the prisoner." The

prisoner." Hairston v. Corn., 97 Va. 754, 32 S.E. 797.

## PRISONER AT THE BAR

An accused person,
while on trial before the court, is so called. One
legal effect a "prisoner at the bar," notwithstand-
ing he has given bond for his appearance at the

under bond or other process of law, or when phys-
ically held under arrest, and when actually on

right of an individual (or corporation) to with-
hold himself and his property from public scrut-
iny, if he so chooses. It is said to exist only so
far as its assertion is consistent with law or pub-
lic policy, and in a proper case equity will inter-
fere, if there is no remedy at law, to prevent an
injury threatened by the invasion of, or infringe-
ment upon, this right from motives of curiosity,
gain, or malice. Federal Trade Commission v.

Geiger, 9 N.J.L. 233.

## PRIVATE INTERNATIONAL LAW

A name
used by some writers to indicate that branch of
the law which is now more commonly called "Con-
PRIVATE LAW. As used in contradistinction to
public law, the term means all that part of the
law which is administered between citizen and
citizen, or which is concerned with the definition,
regulation, and enforcement of rights in cases
where both the person in whom the right inheres
and the person upon whom the obligation is inci-
dent are private individuals. See Public Law.

## PRIVATE STREET

Literally speaking, this is
an impossibility, for no way can be both private

79, 82.

## PRIVATEER

A vessel owned, equipped, and
armed by one or more private individuals, and
duly commissioned by a belligerent power to go
on cruises and make war upon the enemy, usually
by preying on his commerce. A private vessel
commissioned by the state by the issue of a letter
of marque to its owner to carry on all hostilities
by sea, presumably according to the laws of war.
Formerly a 'state issued letters of marque to its
own subjects, and to those of neutral states as
well, but a privateersman who accepted letters of
marque from both belligerents was regarded as
a pirate. By the Declaration of Paris (April,
1856), privateering was abolished, but the United
States, Spain, Mexico, and Venezuela did not ac-
cede to this declaration. It has been thought that
the constitutional provision empowering Congress
to issue letters of marque deprives it of the pow-
er to join in a permanent treaty abolishing pri-
vateering. 28 Am.L.Rev. 615; 24 Am.L.Rev. 902;
19 Law Mag. & Rev. 35.

Law of Libel and Slander
An exemption from liability for the speaking
or publishing of defamatory words concerning an-
other, based on the fact that the statement was
made in the performance of a duty, political, judi-
cial, social, or personal. Privilege is either ab-
solute or conditional. The former protects the
speaker or publisher without reference to his mo-
tives or the truth or falsity of the statement. This
may be claimed in respect, for instance, to state-
ments made in legislative debates, in reports of
military officers to their superiors in the line of
their duty, and statements made by judges, wit-
nesses, and jurors in trials in court. Conditional
privilege (called also "qualified privilege") will
protect the speaker or publisher unless actual mal-
ice and knowledge of the falsity of the statement
is shown. This may be claimed where the com-
munication related to a matter of public interest,
or where it was necessary to protect one's private
interest and was made to a person having an in-
terest in the same matter. Hill v. Drainage Co.,
79 Hun, 335, 29 N.Y.S. 427; Cooley v. Galyon, 109

public service or the administration of justice requires
complete immunity from being called to account for lan-
guage used. Taber v. Aransas Harbor Terminal Ry., Tex.
Civ.App., 219 S.W. 860, 861. It is based upon the theory
that the publication of defamatory matter must be pro-
tected in the interest of and for the necessities of society,
even though it be both false and malicious. Light Pub.
Co. v. Huntress, Tex.Civ.App., 199 S.W. 1168, 1171.
"Qualified privilege" extends to all communications
made in good faith upon any subject-matter in which the
party communicating has an interest or in reference to
which he has a duty to a person having a corresponding
interest or duty, although the duty be not a legal one, but
of a moral or social character of imperfect obligation and
it arises from the necessity of full and unrestricted com-
munication concerning a matter in which the parties have
an interest or duty. Southern Ice Co. v. Black, 136 Tenn.
391, 189 S.W. 861, 863, Ann.Cas.1917E, 695.
Maritime Law

sation, or rather a gratuity, customary in certain

by the parties. 3 Chit. Commer. Law, 431,
Parliamentary Law
The right of a particular question, motion, ar
statement to take precedence over all other busi-
ness before the house and to be considered imme-
diately, notwithstanding any consequent interfer-
ence with or setting aside the rules of procedure

"personal privilege," where it concerns one mem-
ber of the house in his capacity as a legislator, or
of the "privilege of the house," where it concerns
the rights, immunities, or dignity of the entire
body, or of "constitutional privilege," where it re-
lates to some action to be taken or some order of
proceeding expressly enjoined by the constitution.
General

international law, the policy of the law, or the
necessities of justice or of the administration of
government, whereby they are exempted from ar-
rest on civil process, and, in some cases, on crim-
inal charges, either permanently, as 4n the case of
a foreign minister and his suite, or temporarily,
as in the case of members of the legislature, par-
ties and witnesses engaged in a particular suit,
etc. 1 Kent 243; 8 R. I. 43; 2 Stra. 985; 1 M. & W.

McMaster, 104 S.C. 501, 89 S.E. 398, 399. They are
only those which owe their existence to the fed-
eral government, its national character, its Con-
stitution, or its laws. Ownbey v. Morgan, 256 U.

That one of two vessels
which, as against the other, ordinarily has the
right or duty to hold her course and speed. Un-

does not excuse her from failing to observe the
rules, inattention to signals, or failure to answer
where an answer is required, or from adopting
such precautions as may be necessary to avoid a
collision. The West Hartland, C.C.A.Wash., 2 F.
2d 834.

## PRIVILEGED VILLENAGE

In old English law.
A species of villenage in which the tenants held
by certain and determinate services; otherwise
called "villein-socage." Bract. fol. 209. Now call-
ed "privileged copyhold," incuding the tenure in
ancient demesne. 2 Bl.Comm. 99, 100.
PRIVILEGIA QUIE RE VERA SUNT IN PRZE-
JUDICIUM REIPUBLICIE, MAGIS TAMEN HA-
BENT SPECIOSA FRONTISPICIA, ET BONI
PUBLICI PRZETEXTUM, QUAM BONZE ET LE-
GALES CONCESSIONES; SED PRZETEXTU LI-
CIT' NON DEBET ADMITTI ILLICTUM. 11
Coke, 88. Privileges which are truly in prejudice
of public good have, however, a more specious
front and pretext of public good than good and
legal grants; but, under pretext of legality, that
which is illegal ought not to be admitted.

## PRIVILEGIUM

In Roman law. A special con-
stitution by which the Roman emperor conferred
on some single person some anomalous or irreg-
ular right, or imposed upon some single person
some anomalous or irregular obligation, or in-
flicted on some single person some anomalous or
irregular punishment. When such privilegia con-
ferred anomalous rights, they were styled "fa-
vorable." When they imposed anomalous obliga-
tions, or inflicted anomalous punishments, they
were styled "odious." Aust.Jur. § 748. A pri-
vate law inflicting a punishment or conferring a
reward. Calvinus, Lex.; Cicero, de Lege, 3, 19;
pro Domo 17; Vicat, Voc.Jur.
In modern civil law. Every peculiar right or
favor granted by the law, contrary to the com-
mon rule. Mackeld. Rom. Law, § 197. A species
of lien or claim upon an article of property, not
dependent upon possession, but continuing until
either satisfied or released. Such is the lien, rec-
ognized by modern maritime law, of seamen upon
the ship for their wages. 2 Pars. Mar. Law, 561.

## PRIVILEGIUM CLERICALE

The benefit of
clergy, (q. v.).

## PRIVILEGIUM EST BENEFICIUM PERSON- ALE, ET EXTINGUITUR CUM PERSONA

## PRIVILEGIUM EST QUASI PRIVATA LEX

2
Bulst. 189. Privilege is, as it were, a private law.

## PRIVILEGIUM NON VALET CONTRA REM- PUBLICAM

Privilege is of no force against the
commonwealth. Even necessity does not excuse,
where the act to be done is against the common-
wealth. Bac. Max. p. 32, in reg. 5; Broom, Max.
18; Noy, Max., 9th ed. 34.

## PRIVILEGIUM, PROPERTY PROPTER

A qual-
ified property in animals ferce naturce; e., a
privilege of hunting, taking, and killing them, in
exclusion of others. 2 Bl.Comm. 394; 2 Steph.
Comm. 9.

## PRIVITY

Mutual or successive relationship to
the same rights of property. 1 Greenl.Ev. § 189;
Duffy v. Blake, 91 Wash. 140, 157 P. 480, 482;
Haverhill v. International Ry. Co., 217 App.Div.
521, 217 N.Y.S. 522, 523.
Thus, the executor is in privity with the testator, the
heir with the ancestor, the assignee with the assignor, the
donee with the donor, and the lessee with the lessor.
Litchfield v. Crane, 8 S.Ct. 210, 123 U.S. 549, 31 L. Ed. 199.
Derivative interest founded on, or growing out
of, contract, connection, or bond of union between
parties; mutuality of interest. Hodgson v. Mid-
west Oil Co., C.C.A.Wyo., 17 F.2d 71, 75.
Private knowledge; joint knowledge with an-
other of a private concern; cognizance implying
a consent or concurrence. Taylor v. Ferroman
Properties, 103 Fla. 960, 139 So. 149, 150.
In a strict and technical sense a judgment creditor does
not occupy such a
the meaning of the word "privity," for there is no succes-
sion to the property of the debtor until a sale under execu-
tion is had and the judgment creditor has become vested
with the title thereof. But a majority of the courts have
enlarged the meaning of the word, and consequently have
held that there is privity between the two before there is
an actual devolution of the title of the property owned by
the debtor. Buss v. Kemp Lumber Co., 23 N.M. 567, 170
P. 54, 56, L.R.A.1918C, 1015.
Privity of blood exists between an heir and his
ancestor, (privity in blood inheritable,) and be-
tween coparceners. This privity was formerly of
importance in the law of descent cast. Co. Litt.
271a, 242a; 2 Inst. 516; 8 Coke, 42b.
Privity of contract is that connection or rela-
tionship which exists between two or more con-
tracting parties. It is essential to the mainte-
nance of an action on any contract that there
should subsist a privity between the plaintiff and
defendant in respect of the matter sued on.
Brown.
Privity of estate is that which exists between
lessor and lessee, tenant for life and remainder-
man or reversioner, etc., and their respective as-
signees, and between joint tenants and copar-
ceners. Privity of estate is required for a release
by enlargement. Sweet.

## PRIVITY OR KNOWLEDGE

Under Rev.St. §1
4283-4286 (46 U.S.C.A. §1 183-186) withholding
the right to limit liability if the shipowner had
"privity or knowledge" of the fault which oc-
casioned damages, privity or knowledge must be
actual and not merely constructive, and must in-
volve a personal participation of the owner in
some fault or act of negligence causing or con-
tributing to the injury suffered. The 84-H, C.C.
A.N.Y., 296 F. 427, 431. The words import actual
knowledge of the things causing or contributing
to the loss, or knowledge or means of knowledge
of a condition of things likely to produce or con-
tribute to the loss without adopting proper means
to prevent it. Petition of Canadian Pac. Ry. Co.,
D.C.Wash., 278 F. 180, 189.

## PRIVY

A person who is in privity with another.
One who is a partaker or has any part or interest

things as pass the great seal. Co. 2d Inst. 554. A
seal of the British government which is affixed to
documents not requiring the great seal. Encycl.
Br.

## PRIVY SIGNET

In English law. The signet or
seal which is first used in making out grants and

of the principal secretary of state. 2 Bl.Comm.

## PRIVY TOKEN

A false mark or sign, forged
object, counterfeited letter, key, ring, etc., used
to deceive persons, and thereby fraudulently get
possession of property. St. 33 Hen. VIII. c. 1. A
false privy token is a false privy document or
sign, not such as is calculated to deceive men gen-
erally, but designed to defraud one or more in-
dividuals. Cheating by such false token was not
indictable at common law. Pub. St. Mass. 1882,
p. 1294.

## PRIVY VERDICT

"sealed verdict," i. e., -one written out, sealed up,
and delivered to the judge or the clerk of the
court.

## PRIZE

Anything offered as a reward of con-
test; a reward offered to the person who, among
several persons or among the public at large,
shall first (or best) perform a certain undertak-
ing or accomplish certain conditions.
An award or recompense for some act done; some valua-
ble thing offered by a person for something done by others.
It is distinguished from a "bet" or "wager" in that it is
known before the event who is to give either the premium
or the prize, and there is but one operation until the ac-
complishment of the act, thing, or purpose for which it is
offered. People v. Cohen, 289 N.Y.S. 397, 400, 160 Misc. 10.
In admiralty law. A vessel or cargo, belong-
%
ing to one of two belligerent powers, apprehend-
ed or forcibly captured at sea by a war-vessel or
privateer of the other belligerent, and claimed
as enemy's property, and therefore liable to ap-
propriation and condemnation under the laws of
war. 1 C.Rob.Adm. 228. The apprehension and
detention at sea of a ship or other vessel, by au-
thority of a belligerent power, either with the de-
sign of appropriating it, with the goods and ef-
fects it contains, or with that of becoming master
of the whole or a part of its cargo. 1 C.Rob. 228.
Captured property regularly condemned by the sentence
of a competent prize court. 1 Kent, Comm. 102.
3Goods taken on land from a public enemy are called
"booty" ; and the distinction between a prize and booty
consists in this, that the former is taken at sea and the
latter on land.

## PRIZE COURTS

Courts having jurisdiction to
adjudicate upon captures made at sea in time of
war, and to condemn the captured property as
prize if lawfully subject to that sentence. In
England, the admiralty courts have jurisdiction
as prize courts, distinct from the jurisdiction on
the instance side. A special commission issues in
time of war to the judge of the admiralty court,
to enable him to hold such court. In America, the
federal district courts have jurisdiction in cases
of prize. 1 Kent, Comm. 101-103, 353-360. See
Penhallow v. Doane, 3 Dall. 91, 1 L.Ed. 507.

## PRIZE-FIGHT

A bout between two persons who
fight each other by means of their fists, by con-
sent, and who have an expectation of reward to
be gained by the contest or competition, either
to be won from the contestant or to be otherwise
awarded, where there is an intent to inflict some
degree of bodily harm on the contestant. Mag-
ness v. Isgrig, 145 Ark. 232, 225 S.W. 332, 334. An
exhibition contest of pugilists for a stake or re-
ward. Sampson v. State, 18 Okl.Cr. 191, 194 P.

naked fist or hand. Sampson v. State, 18 Okl.Cr.
191, 194 P. 279, 280.

## PRIZE GOODS

Goods which are taken on the
high seas, jure belli, out of the hands of the en-
emy. The Adeline, 9 Cranch 244, 284, 3 L.Ed.

demnation, rights of the captors, distribution of
the proceeds, etc. The Buena Ventura, D.C.Fla.,
87 F. 927, 929.

## PRIZE MONEY

## PRO CONSILIO

For counsel given. An annuity
pro consilio amounts to a condition, but in a feoff-
ment or lease for life, etc., it is the consideration,
and does not amount to a condition; for the
state of the land by the feoffment is executed, and
the grant of the annuity is executory. Plowd. 412.

## PRO INTERESSE SUO

According to his inter-
est; to the extent of his interest. Thus, a third
party may be allowed to intervene in a suit pro
interesse suo.
Examination pro interesse suo. When a per-
son claims to be entitled to an estate or other
property sequestered, whether by mortgage, judg-
ment, lease, or otherwise, or has a title paramount
to the sequestration, he should apply to the court

hand; for the occasion as it may arise; adapted

of judicial action adopted under pressure of the
exigencies of the affair in hand, rather than in
conformity to established precedents, is said to
be taken pro re nata.

## PRO SALUTE ANIME

For the good of his
soul. All prosecutions in the ecclesiastical courts
are pro salute animce; hence it will not be a tem-

4 Steph.Comm. 207.

High probability rule. A rule relating to the
right of insured to abandon a vessel, by virtue
of which the right
pend upon the certainty, but upon the high prob-
ability of a total loss, either of the property, or
voyage, or both. The result is to act not upon
certainties, but upon probabilities; and .tf the
facts present a case of extreme hazard, and of
probable expense, exceeding half the value of the
ship, the insured may abandon, though it should
happen that she was afterwards recovered at a
less expense. Fireman's Fund Ins. Co. v. Globe
Nay. Co., C.C.A.Wash., 236 F. 618, 635. In re
Salomon's Estate, 287 N.Y.S. 814, 821, 159 Misc.

Having the appearance of truth;
having the character of probability; appearing to
be founded in reason or experience. State v.
Thiele, 119 Iowa, 659, 94 N.W. 256. Having more
evidence for than against; supported by evidence
which inclines the mind to believe, but leaves
some room for doubt; likely. Barrett v. Green
River Sr. Rock Springs Live Stock Co., 28 Wyo.
379, 205 P. 742, 743. Apparently true, yet possibly
false. Spadra Creek Coal Co. v. Harger, 130 Ark.
374, 197 S.W. 705.

## PROBABLE CAUSE

Reasonable cause. State
v. Baltes, 183 Wis. 545, 198 N.W. 282, 284. Having
more evidence for than against. Ex parte Souza,
65 Cal.App. 9, 222 P. 869, 870. A reasonable
ground for belief in the existence of 'facts war-
ranting the proceedings complained of. Owens
v. Graetzel, 149 Md. 689, 132 A. 265, 267. An ap-
parent state of facts found to exist upon reason-
able inquiry, (that is, such inquiry as the given
case renders convenient and proper,) which would
induce a reasonably intelligent and prudent man
to believe, in a criminal case, that the accused
person had committed the crime charged, or, in a
civil case, that a cause of action existed. Brand
v. Hinchman, 68 Mich. 590, 36 N.W. 664, 13 Am.
St.Rep. 362; Cook v. Singer Sewing Mach. Co.,
138 Cal.App. 418, 32 P.2d 430, 431.
In malicious prosecution the existence of such facts and
circumstances as would excite the belief in a reasonable
mind, acting on the facts within the knowledge of the
prosecutor, that the person charged was guilty of the crime
for which he was prosecuted. Lunsford v. Dietrich, 86 Ala.
250, 5 So. 461, 11 Am.St.Rep. 37. A reasonable ground of
suspicion, supported by circumstances sufficiently strong in
themselves to warrant a prudent and cautious man to
believe that the accused is guilty of the offense with which
he is charged. Sanders v. Palmer, N.Y., 55 F. 217, 5 C.C.
A. 77. Such a state of facts and circumstances known to
the prosecutor personally or by information from others
as would, in the judgment of the court, lead a man of or-
dinary caution, acting conscientiously in the light of such
facts and circumstances, to believe that the person charged
is guilty. Keebey v. Stifft, 145 Ark. 8, 224 S. W. 396, 400.
See, also, Galley v. Brennan, 216 N.Y. 118, 110 N.E. 179,
180. Where defendant in an action for malicious prosecu-
tion shows that before commencing the prosecution he, in
good faith, consulted an attorney of good standing and
made a full disclosure of all of the facts reasonably ob-
tainable, and in good faith acted upon such advice, this
of itself constitutes "probable cause." Gustason v. Speak,
85 Cal.App. 18, 258 P. 725, 726; Treloar v. Harris, 66 Ind.
App. 159, 117 N.E. 975, 976.
As justifying arrest without a warrant by one believed
guilty of felony or to be engaged in commission of a
felony, is a belief fairly arising out of facts and circum-
stances known to officer that a party is engaged in com-
mission of a crime. Day v. U. S., C.C.A.Neb., 37 F.2d 80,
For search warrant means reasonable ground of sus-
picion, supported by circumstances sufficiently strong to
warrant cautious man in believing party is guilty of of-
fense charged. Shore v. U. S., 49 F.2d 519, 521, 60 App.D.
C. 137.
For arrest which must be shown as justification by de-
fendants in action for false imprisonment is reasonable
ground of suspicion supported by circumstances sufficient
in themselves to warrant cautious man in believing accused
to be guilty, but does not depend on actual state of case
in point of fact, as it may turn out upon legal investiga-
tion, but on knowledge of facts which would be sufficient
to induce reasonable belief in truth of accusation. Christ
v. McDonald, 152 Or. 494, 52 P.2d 655, 658.

## PROBABLE CONSEQUENCE

One that is more

num, means such payments as would ordinarily
become payable in the natural course of events,
taking into consideration the expectancy of the
beneficiary. H. W. Clark Co. v. Industrial Com-
mission, 291 Ill. 561, 126 N.E. 579, 582.

## PROBABLE GROUND

As used in the Illinois

## PROBANDI NECESSITAS INCUMBIT ILLI QUI AGIT

The necessity of proving lies with him
who sues. Inst. 2, 20, 4. In other words, the bur-
den of proof of a proposition is upon him who ad-

## PROBARE

Originally, relating to proof; after-
wards, relating to the proof of wills.
The act or process of proving a will. Ross'
Estate v. Abrams, Tex.Civ.App., 239 S.W. 705, 707.

produced before him for official recognition and
registration, and alleged to be the last will and
testament of a certain deceased person, is such
in reality. A judicial act or determination of a
court having competent jurisdiction establishing
the validity of a will. Simpson v. Anderson, 305
Ill. 172, 137 N.E. 88, 89; Peterson v. Demmer, D.
C.Tex., 34 F.Supp. 697, 700.
Also, the copy of the will, made out in parch-
ment or due form, under the seal of the ordinary
or court of probate; and usually delivered to the
executor or administrator of the deceased, to-
gether with a certificate of the will's having been
proved.
In American law, now a general name or term
used to include all matters of which probate
courts have jurisdiction. Johnson v. Harrison, 47
Minn. 575, 50 N.W. 923, 28 Am.St.Rep. 382.
In the canon law, "probate" consisted of pro-
batio, the proof of the will by the executor, and
approbatio, the approbation given by the eccle-
siastical judge to the proof. 4 Reeve, Eng. Law,
77. McCoy v. Clayton, 119 Pa. 133, 12 A. 860;
Reno v. McCully, 65 Iowa 629, 22 N.W. 902; Ap-
peal of Dawley, 16 R.I. 694, 19 A. 248.
The term is used, particularly in Pennsylvania, but not
in a strictly technical sense, to designate the proof of his
claim made by a non-resident plaintiff (when the same is
on book-account, promissory note, etc.) who swears to the
correctness and justness of the same, and that it is due, be-
fore a notary or other officer in his own state ; also of the
copy or statement of such claim filed in court, with the
jurat of such notary attached. Stevens v. D. R. Dunlap
Mercantile Co., 108 Miss. 690, 67 So. 160, 161.
Common and solemn form of probate. In Eng-
lish law, there are two kinds of probate, namely,
probate in common form, and probate in solemn
form. Probate in common form is granted in the
registry, without any formal procedure in court,
upon an ex parte application made by the execu-
tor. Probate in solemn form is in the nature of a
final decree pronounced in open court, all parties
interested having been duly cited. The difference
between the effect of probate in common form
and probate in solemn form is that probate in
common form is revocable, whereas probate in
solemn form is irrevocable, as against all per-
sons who have been cited to see the proceedings,
or who can be proved to have been privy to those
proceedings, except in the case where a will of
subsequent date is discovered, in which case pro-
bate of an earlier will, though granted in solemn
form, would be revoked. Coote, Prob. Pr. (5th
Ed.) 237-239; Mozley & Whitley. And see Luther
v. Luther, 122 Ill. 558, 13 N.E. 166.

W.Bla. 1060; 6 Term 365.
A writ (procedendo ad judicium) which issued
out of the common-law jurisdiction of the court
of chancery, when judges of any subordinate

writ of procedendo ad judicium was awarded,
commanding the inferior court in the sovereign's

specifying any particular judgment. Wharton.
McCord v. Briggs and Turivas, 338 Ill. 158, 170 N.
E. 320, 324. It was the earliest remedy for the

333. That which regulates the formal steps in an,
action or other judicial proceeding; a form, man-

53, 112 N.E. 190, 191. The judicial process for en-
forcing rights and dutids recognized by substan-
tive law and for justly administering redress for

This term is commonly opposed to the sum of legal
principles constituting the substance of the law, and de-
notes the body of rules, whether of practice or of pleading,
whereby rights are effectuated through the successful ap-
plication of the proper remedies. It is also generally dis-
tinguished from the law of evidence. Brown; Sackheim v.
Pigueron, 215 N.Y. 62, 109 N.E. 109, 111. Cochran v. Ward,

v. Erie R. Co., 106 Ohio St. 408, 140 N.E. 366, 367. It not
only embraces practice in courts, but regulation of the con-
duct of the court itself wherein such practice takes place.
State v. Greenwald, 186 Ind. 321, 116 N.E. 296, 297.
The law of procedure is what is now common-

or filing of the bill until the entry of a final judgment, or
may be used to describe any act done by authority of a

Act July 1, 1898, c. 541, §§ 23-25, 30 Stat. 552, 553
(11 U.S.C.A. §§ 74-76), this term covers questions
between the alleged bankrupt or the receiver or
trustee on the one hand and the general creditors
as such on the other, commencing with the peti-
tion for adjudication and ending with the dis-
charge, including matters of administration gen-
erally, and is distinguished from "controversies,
at law and in equity arising in the course of
bankruptcy proceedings," which involve questions
between the receiver or trustee, representing the
bankrupt and his general creditors as such, on
the one hand, and adverse claimants, on the oth-
er, concerning property in the possession of the
receiver or trustee or of the claimants, to be liti-
gated in appropriate plenary suits, and not affect-
ing directly administrative orders and judgments,
but only the extent of the estate to be distributed
ultimately among general creditors. In re Breyer
Printing Co., C.C.A.Ill., 216 F. 878, 880.
The phrase "controversy arising in bankruptcy
proceedings" includes those matters arising in
the course of a bankruptcy proceeding which are
the bankrupt estate, but present distinct and sep-
arable issues between the trustee and adverse
claimants concerning the right and title to the
bankrupt's estate. Gibbons v. Goldsmith, 222 F.
826, 828, 138 C.C.A. 252.
Proceeding in error. One by way of writ of
error. State v. Scott, 34 Wyo. 163, 242 P. 322, 324.
Special proceeding. This phrase has been used
in the New York and other codes of procedure as
a generic term for all civil remedies which are
not ordinary actions. An action is an ordinary
proceeding in a court of justice, by which one
party prosecutes another party for the enforce-
ment or protection of a right, the redress or pre-
vention of a wrong, or the punishment of a public
offence. Every other remedy is a special pro-
ceeding. State v. Rosenwald Bros. Co., 23 N.M.
578, 170 P. 42, 44.
Summary proceeding. Any proceeding by which
a controversy is settled, case disposed of, or trial
conducted, in a prompt and simple manner, with-
out the aid of a jury, without presentment or in-
dictment, or in other respects out of the regular
course of the common law. In procedure, pro-
ceedings are said to be summary 'when they are
short and simple in comparison with regular
proceedings; e., in comparison with the pro-
ceedings which alone would have been applicable,
either in the same or analogous cases, if summary
proceedings had not been available. Sweet. And
see Phillips v. Phillips, 8 N.J.L. 122.
Supplementary proceeding. A separate proceed-
ing in an original action, in which the court where
the action is pending is called upon to exercise its
jurisdiction in aid of the judgment in the action.
Bryant v. Bank of California, 7 Pac. 128, 130, 2
Cal.Unrep. 475. In a more particular sense, a
proceeding in aid of execution, authorized by stat-
ute in some states in cases where no leviable prop-
erty of the judgment debtor is found. It is a stat-
utory equivalent in actions at law of the crew 1-
tor's bill in equity, and in states where law and
equity are blended, is provided as a substitute
therefor. In this proceeding the judgment debtor
is summoned to appear before the court (or a ref-
eree or examiner) and submit to an oral examina-
tion touching all his property and effects, and if
property subject to execution and in his posses-
sion or control is thus discovered, he is ordered to
deliver it up, or a receiver may be appointed.
Eikerberry v. Edwards, 67 Iowa 619, 25 N.W. 832,
56 Am.Rep. 360.

## PROCEEDS

Issues; income; yield; receipts;
produce; money or articles or other thing of value
arising or obtained by the sale of property; the

1137. Thus, goods purchased with money arising
from the sale of other goods, or obtained on their
credit, are proceeds of such goods. 2 Pars.Marit.
L. 201; Bened.Adm. 290. Proceeds does not nec-
essarily mean cash or money. Phelps v. Harris,
The word when applied to the income to be derived from
real estate embraces the idea of issues, rents, profits, or
produce. Gorin Say. Bank v. Early, Mo.App., 260 S.W.
480, 483. It is synonymous with avails, use, and profits.
In re Coughlin's Estate, 53 N.D. 188, 205 N.W. 14, 16.

tion in writing in due form of law, of what has

Hall v. Hall, 11 Tex. 526, 539.
A written report, which is signed, setting forth
a statement of facts. This term is applied to the
report proving the meeting and the resolutions
passed at a meeting of shareholders, or to the
report of a commission to take testimony. It can
also be applied to the statement drawn up by a
huissier in relation to any facts which one of the
parties to a suit can be interested in proving; for
instance the sale of a counterfeited object. State-
ments, drawn up by other competent authorities,
of misdemeanors or other criminal acts, are also
called by this name. Arg. Fr. Merc. Law, 570.

An art or method by which any particular result
is produced. An act or series of acts performed
upon the subject-matter to be transformed or
reduced to a different state or thing. American
Graphophone Co. v. Gimbel Bros. (D.C.) 234 F.
361, 368; Nestle Patent Holding Co. v. E. Fred-
erics, Inc. (C.C.A.) 261 F. 780, 783. A means or
method employed to produce a certain result or
effect, or a mode of treatment of given materials
to produce a desired result, either by chemical
action, by the operation or application of some
element or power of nature, or of one substance
to another, irrespective of any machine or me-
chanical device; in this sense a "process" is pat-
enthble, though, strictly speaking, it is the art
and not the process which is the subject of pat-
ent. Rohm v. Martin Dennis Co., D.C.N.J., 263 F.
106, 107.
Broadly speaking, a "process" is a definite combination
of new or old elements, ingredients, operations, ways, 'or
means to produce a new, improved or old result, and any
substantial change therein by omission, to the same or
better result, or by modification or substitution, with dif-
ferent function, to the same or better result, is a new and
patentable process. Minerals Separation v. Hyde, D.C.
Mechanical process. A process involving solely
the application of mechanism or mechanical prin-
ciples; an aggregation of functions; not patent.
able considered apart from the mechanism em-
ployed or the finished product of manufacture.
Risdon Iron, etc., Works v. Medart, 15 S.Ct. 745,
158 U.S. 68, 39 L.Ed. 899; Cochrane v. Deener, 94
U.S. 780, 24 L.Ed. 139.
Practice
This word is generally defined to be the means
of compelling the defendant in an action to appear
in court; Gondas v. Gondas, 99 N.J.Eq. 473, 134
A. 615, 618; or a means whereby a court compels
a compliance with its demands. Frank Adam
Electric Co. v. Witman, 16 Ga.App. 574, 85 S.E.
819, 820. Stevens v. Associated Mortg. Co. of New
Jersey, 107 N.J.Eq. 297, 152 A. 461, 462. And
when actions were commenced by original writ,
instead of, as at present, by writ of summons, the
method of compelling the defendant to appear was
by what was termed "original process," being
founded on the original writ, and so called also
to distinguish it from "mesne" or "intermediate"
process, which was some writ or process which
issued during the progress of the suit. The word
"process," however, as now commonly understood,
signifies those formal instruments called "writs."
The word "process" is in common-law practice
frequently applied to the writ of summons, which
is the instrument now in use for commencing
personal actions. Farmers' Implement Co. of Hal-
lock, Minn., v. Sandberg, 132 Minn. 389, 157 N.W.
642. But in its more comprehensive signification
it includes not only the writ of summons, but all
other writs which may be issued during the pro-
gress of an action. Those writs which are used
to carry the judgments of the courts into effect,
and which are termed "writs of execution" are
also commonly denominated "final process," be-
cause they usually issue at the end of a suit.
Anderson v. Dewey, 91 Conn. 510, 100 A. 99, 100.
A writ, summons, or order issued in a judicial proceed-
ing to acquire jurisdiction of a person or his property, to
expedite the cause or enforce the judgment. Royal Ex-
change Assurance of London v. Bennettsville & C. R. Co.,
95 S.C. 375, 79 S.E. 104, 105. A writ or summons issued in
the course of judicial proceedings. Radovich v. French, 36
Nev. 341, 135 P. 920, 921. The term in statutes may be
used with the meaning of procedure. Safford v. United
States, C.C.A.N.Y., 252 F. 471, 472.
In the practice of the English privy council in
ecclesiastical appeals, "process" means an official
copy of the whole proceedings and proofs of the
court below, which is transmitted to the registry
of the court of appeal by the registrar of the court
below in obedience to an order or requisition re-
quiring him so to do, called a "monition for pro-
cess," issued by the court of appeal. Macph. Jud.
Com. 173.
Abuse of process. See Abuse.
Compulsory process. See Compulsory,
Executory process. In the law of Louisiana, a
summary process in the nature of an order of
seizure and sale, which is available when the right
which includes or imports a confession of judg-
ment and a privilege or lien in his favor, and also
to enforce the execution of a judgment rendered
in another jurisdiction. Code Prac. art. 732.
Final process. The last process in a suit; that
is, writs of execution. Thus distinguished from
mesne process, which includes all writs issued
during the progress of a cause and before final
judgment. Collier v. Blake, 16 Ga.App. 382, 85
S.E. 354. A distress warrant is final process, un-
less arrested by the interposition of a counter
affidavit. Long v. Clark, 16 Ga.App. 355, 85 S.E.
Irregular process. Sometimes defined to mean
process absolutely void, and not merely errone-
ous and voidable; but that term is usually applied
to all process not issued in strict conformity with
the law, whether the defect appears upon the face
of the process, or by reference to extrinsic facts,
and whether such defects render the process ab-
solutely void or only voidable. And see Bryan v.
Congdon, 86 F. 221, 29 C.C.A. 670.
Judicial process. In a wide sense, this term
may include all the acts of a court from the begin-
ning to the end of its proceedings in a given
cause; but more specifically it means the writ,
summons, mandate, or other process which is us-
ed to inform the defendant of the institution of
proceedings against him and to compel 'his ap-
pearance, in either civil or criminal cases. Blair
v. Maxbass Security Bank of Maxbass, 44 N.D.
12, 176 N.W. 98, 100; In re Smith & Shuck, D.C.
Iowa, 132 F. 301, 303.
Legal process. This term is sometimes used as
equivalent to "lawful process." Cooley v. Davis,
34 Iowa 130. Thus, it is said that legal process
means process not merely fair on its face, but in
fact valid. State v. Wagoner, 123 Kan. 586, 256
P. 959, 960. But properly it means a writ, war-
rant, mandate, or other process issuing from a
court of justice, such as an attachment, execu-
tion, injunction, etc. Grossman v. Weiss, 221 N.
Y.S. 266, 267, 129 Misc. 234.
Mesne . process. As distinguished from final
process, this signifies any writ or process issued
between the commencement of the action and the
suing out of execution. 3 Bla.Comm. 279. This
is substantially the meaning of the term as used
in admiralty rule 1 (29 S.Ct. xxxix; 28 U.S.C.A. §§
2071, 2073), providing that no mesne process shall
issue until the libel shall be filed in the clerk's
office. The City of Philadelphia, D.C.Pa., 263 F.
234, 235. "Mesne" in this connection may be de-
fined as intermediate; intervening; the middle
between two extremes. L. N. Dantzler Lumber
Co. v. Texas & P. Ry. Co., 119 Miss. 328, 80 So.
770, 775, 49 A.L.R. 1669. Mesne process includes
the writ of summons, (although that is now the
usual commencement of actions,) because ancient-
ly that was preceded by the original writ. The
writ of capias ad respondendum was called
"mesne" to distinguish it, on the one hand, from
the original process by which a suit was formerly
process of execution. Birmingham Dry Goods
Co. v. Bledsoe, 21 So. 403, 113 Ala. 418.
Original process. That by which a judicial
proceeding is instituted; process to compel the
appearance of the defendant. Distinguished from
"mesne" process, which issues, during the prog-
ress of a suit, for some subordinate or collateral
purpose; and from "final" process, which is
process of execution. Appeal of Hotchkiss, 32
Conn. 353.
Process of interpleader. A means of determin-
ing the right to property claimed by each of two
or more persons, which is in the possession of a
third.
Process of law. See Due Process of Law.
Process roll. In practice. A roll used for the
entry of process to save the statute of limitations.
1 Tidd, Pr. 161, 162.
Regular process. Such as is issued according
to rule and the prescribed practice, or which eman-
ates, lawfully and in a proper case, from a court
or magistrate possessing jurisdiction.
Summary process. Such as is immediate or
instantaneous, in distinction from the ordinary
course, by emanating and taking effect without
intermediate applications or delays. Gaines v.
Travis, 8 N.Y.Leg.Obs. 49.
Trustee process. The name given in some
states (particularly in New England) to the proc-
ess of garnishment or foreign attachment.
Void process. Such as was issued without pow-
er in the court to award it, or which the court
had not acquired jurisdiction to issue in the par-
ticular case, or which fails in some material re-
spect to comply with the requisite form of legal
process. Bryan v. Congdon, C.C.A.Kan., 86 F.
221, 223, 29 C.C.A. 670.

## PROCESSION

To beat the bounds of (a par-
ish, lands, etc.). Webster's New Int. Dict. In
some of the North American colonies (and still in
the states of North Carolina and Tennessee), to
make a procession around a piece of land in or-
der formally to determine its bounds. Murray's
New English Dict.
The ceremony of perambulating the boundaries of a
parish ("processioning," as it was commonly called in
later times) is an extremely old one. Blomfield, Hist.
Fritwell, quoted in Murray's New English Dict. s. v.
"Processioning" (q. v.).

## PROCESSIONING

A survey and inspection of
boundaries periodically performed in some of the
American colonies by the local authorities. It
was analogous in part to the English perambula-

tion of the practice of accurate surveying and of
recording. The term is still used of some official
surveys in North Carolina and Tennessee. Cent.
Dict. See Code Tenn.1858, § 2020 et seq.; Rhodes
• PROCESUM CONTINUANDO. In English prac-
tice. A writ for the continuance of process after
the death of the chief justice or other justices
in the commission of oyer and terminer. Reg.
Orig. 128.
PROCESSUS LEGIS EST GRAVIS VEXATIO;
EXECUTIO LEGIS CORONAT OPUS. The proc-
ess of the law is a grievous vexation; the execu-
tion of the law crowns the work. Co.Litt. .289b.
The proceedings in an action while in progress are
burdensome and vexatious; the execution, being
the end and object of the action, crowns the labor,
or rewards it with success.

## PROCHEIN

L. Fr. Next. A term somewhat
used in modern law, and more frequently in the
old law; as prochein ami, prochein cousin. Co.
Litt. 10.

## PROCHEIN AMI

,
which, however, was afterwards reduced to one
reading in each term. Cowell. See 2 Bl.Comm.

## PROCLAMATION OF EXIGENTS

A proctor, strictly speaking, conducts the proceeding out
of court, as an English solicitor does in common-law
courts; while the advocate conducts those in court. But
in this country the distinction is not observed. The fees
of proctors are fixed by statute (see 28 U.S.C.A. § 1923).

L.R. 462. Action under a power of attorney or
other constitution of agency. Indorsing a bill or
note "by procuration" is doing it as proxy for an-
other or by his authority. The use of the word
procuration (usually, per procuratione, or abbrev-
iated to per pros. or p. p.) on a promissory note
by an agent is notice that the agent has but a
limited authority to sign. Neg.Instr.Act. § 21.
An express procuration is one made by the ex-
press consent of the parties. An implied or tacit
procuration takes place when an individual sees
another managing his affairs and does not inter-

sons, not things, and who was generally the pa-
tron of the person whose defence he prepared, the
person himself speaking it. It is also distinguish-
ed from cognitor who conducted the cause in the
presence of his principal, and generally in cases
of citizenship; whereas the procurator conducted
the cause in the absence of his principal. Calvin-
us, Lex.

classes of procureurs: Procureurs ad negotia,
appointed by an individual to act for him in the
administration of his affairs; persons invested
with a power of attorney; corresponding to "at-
torneys in fact." Procureurs ad lites were per-
sons appointed and authorized to act for a party
in a court of justice. These corresponded to at-
torneys at law, (now called, in England, "solici-
tors of the supreme court.") The order of pro-
cureurs was abolished in 1791, and that of avous.
established in their place. Mozley & Whitley.

## PROCUREUR DE LA REPUBLIQUE

(Former-
ly procureur du roi.) In French law. A public
prosecutor, with whom rests the initiation of all
criminal proceedings. In the exercise of his of-
fice (which appears to include the apprehension of

the public force, (posse comitatus;) and the of-
ficefs of police are auxiliary to him.
PROCUREUR GENERAL, or IMPERIAL. In
French law. An officer of the imperial court, who
either personally or by his deputy prosecuted
every one who was accused of a crime according
to the forms of French law. His functions were
apparently confined to preparing the case for trial

the sentence in case of a conviction, and being
present at the delivery of the sentence. He had
a general superintendence over the officers of po-
lice and of the juges d'instruction, and he requir-
ed from the procureur du roi a general report
once in every three months. Brown.

## PRODES HOMINES

A term said by Tomlins to
be frequently applied in the ancient books to the

PRODIGAL. In civil law. A person who, though
of full age, is incapable of managing his affairs,
and of the obligations which attend them, in con-
sequence of his bad conduct, and for whom a cur-

## PRODUCE

To bring forward; to show or ex-
hibit; to bring into view or notice; as, to present
a play, including its presentation in motion pic-
tures. Manners v. Morosco, D.C.N.Y., 254 F. 737,

220 N.Y.S. 773, 776, 128 Misc. 679; to produce
books or writings at a trial in obedience to a sub-
pcena duces tecum.
To produce, for the purpose of use in a legal hearing,
within the meaning of a subpoena ordering a witness to
produce a public record, means more than an appearance
with the document in his possession, and implies the hand-
ing of it to the tribunal for perusal, and, if that is not
asked, the reading aloud of it by witness or counsel.
Langley v. F. W. Woolworth Co., 46 R.I. 394, 129 A. 1, 2.

ed" by taxation, not when the tax is levied, but
when the sums are collected. Board of Education
of Louisville v. Sea, 167 Ky. 772, 181 S.W. 670, 673.

## PRODUCE BROKER

A person whose occupa-
tion it is to buy or sell agricultural or farm prod-
ucts. U. S. v. Simons, 1 Abb. (U.S.) 470, Fed.Cas.
No.16,291.

## PRODUCENT

The party calling a witness un-
der the old system of the English ecclesiastical
courts.

Bring about, to cause to happen
or take place, as an effect or result. Strong v.
Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., Tex.Civ.App., 170
S.W.2d 786, 788.

## PRODUCING CAUSE

Respecting broker's com-
mission, is act which, continuing in unbroken
chain of cause and effect, produces result. Sche-
besta v. Stewart, Tex.Civ.App., 37 S.W.2d 781, 786.
A "producing cause" of an employee's death for which
compensation is sought is that cause which, in a natural

cattle on the premises. Case v. Ploutz, 154 N.Y.S. 914,
915, 90 Misc. 568.

## PRODUCTIO SECTLE

In old English law. Pro-
duction of suit; the production by a plaintiff of
his secta or witnesses to prove the allegations of
his count. 3 Bl.Comm. 295.

## PRODUCTION

That which is produced or made
product; fruit of labor; as the productions of the
earth, comprehending all vegetables and fruits;
the productions of intellect, or genius, as poems
and prose compositions; the productions of art,
as manufactures of every kind. Dano v. R. Co., 27
Ark. 567.
In political economy. The creation of objects which
constitute wealth. The requisites of production are labor,
capital, and the materials and motive forces afforded by
nature. Of these, labor and the raw material of the
globe are primary and indispensable. Natural motive pow-
ers may be called in to the assistance of labor, and are
a help, but not an essential, of production. The remaining
requisite, capital, is itself the product of labor. Its in-
strumentality in production is therefore, in reality, that of
labor in an indirect shape. Mill, Pol. Econ. ; Wharton.

## PRODUCTION FOR COMMERCE

Within Fair
Labor Standards Act includes production of goods
which, at time of production, employer, according
to normal course of his business, intends or ex-
pects to move in interstate commerce immediately
following initial sale. Fair Labor Standards Act
of 1938, §§ 6, 7, 29 U.S.C.A. §§ 206, 207. Hill v.
Jones, D.C.Ky., 59 F.Supp. 569, 572.

## PRODUCTION OF SUIT

In pleading. The for-
mula, "and therefore [or thereupon] he brings his
suit," etc., with which declarations always con-
clude. Steph.P1. 428, 429. In old pleading, this
referred to the production by the plaintiff of his
secta or suit, i. e. persons prepared to confirm
what he had stated in the declaration. The
phrase has remained; but the practice from
which it arose is obsolete. 3 Bla.Comm. 295.

## PROFANE

Irreverent toward God or holy
things; written or spoken; acting or acted, in
manifest or implied contempt of sacred things.
Town of Torrington v. Taylor, 59 Wyo. 109, 137
P.2d 621, 624; Duncan v. U. S., C.C.A.Or., 48 F.2d
128, 133. That which has not been consecrated.
Dig. 11, 7, 2, 4.

## PROFANE PLACE

A place which is neither sac-
red nor sanctified nor religious. Dig. 11, 7, 2, 4,
PROFANELY. In a profane manner. In Penn-
sylvania, a technical word in indictments for the
statutory offense of profanity. Updegraph v.
Corn., 11 Serg. & R. (Pa.) 394.

## PROFANITY

Irreverence towards sacred things;
particularly, an irreverent or blasphernous use of
the name of God; punishable by statute in some
jurisdictions. Orf v. State, 147 Miss. 160, 113 So.
202. Cason v. Baskin, 155 Fla. 198, 20 So.2d 243,
247, 168 A.L.R. 430.

which descends to us from our ascendants. Dig.
23, 3, 5.

## PROFER

In old English law. An offer or prof-
fer; an offer or endeavor to proceed in an action,
by any man concerned to do so. A return made
by a sheriff of his accounts into the exchequer;
a payment made on such return. Cowell.

## PROFERT IN CURIA

L. Lat: (Sometimes writ-
ten profert in curiam.) He produces in' court.
In old practice, these words were inserted in a
declaration, as an allegation that the plaintiff was
ready to produce, or did actually produce, in
court, the deed or other written instrument on
which his suit was founded, in order that the
court might inspect the same and the defendant
hear it read. The same formula was used where
the defendant pleaded a written instrument.
In modern practice. An allegation formally
made in a pleading, where a party alleges a deed,
that he shows it in court, it being in fact retained
in his own custody. Steph.P1. 67. But by virtue of
the allegation, the deed is then constructively in
possession of the court. 6 M. & G. 277; Tucker v.
State, 11 Md. 322; Germain v. Wilgus, 67 F. 597,
14 C.C.A. 561. The profert of any recorded in-
strument, as letters patent, is equivalent to an-
nexing a copy. American Bell Tel. Co. v. South-
ern Tel. Co., C.C.Ark., 34 F. 803. This result
does not occur, however, in the case of other doc-
uments, such as a note. Waterhouse v. Sterchi
Bros. Furniture Co., 139 Tenn. 117, 201 S.W. 150,
Profert and oyer are abolished in England by the Com-
mon Law Procedure Act, 15 & 16 Viet. c. 76; and a pro-
vision exists, 14 & 15 Vict. c. 99, for allowing inspection
of all documents in the possession or under the control of
the party against whom the inspection is asked. 25 E. L.
& E. 304. In many of the states profert has been abolished,
and in some instances the instrument must be set forth in
the pleading of the party relying upon it.

## PROFESS

To make open declaration of, to make
public declaration or avowal. Wristen v. Wris-
ten, Tex.Civ.App., 119 S.W.2d 1104, 1106.

## PROFESSION

A public declaration respecting
something. Cod. 10, 41, 6.
A vocation, calling, occupation or employment
involving labor, skill, education, special knowledge
and compensation or profit, but the labor and skill
involved is predominantly mental or intellectual,
rather than physical or manual. Maryland Cas-
ualty Co. v. Crazy Water Co., Tex.Civ.App., 160
S.W.2d 102, 104. The method or means pursued
by persons of technical or scientific training.
Board of Sup'rs of Amherst County v. Boaz, 176
Va. 126, 10 S.E.2d 498, 499.
The term originally contemplated only theology, law,
and medicine, but as applications of science and learning
are extended to other departments of affairs, other voca-
tions also receive the name, which implies professed attain-
ments in special knowledge as distinguished from mere
skill. Aulen v. Triumph Explosive, D.C.Md., 58 F.Supp. 4,
In ecclesiastical law. The act of entering into
a religious order. See 17 Vin.Abr. 545.

## PROFESSIONAL

A term applied in the Immi-
gration Law, 8 U.S.C.A. § 137c, to an alien instru-
mental musician who is of distinguished merit and
ability or is a member of a musical organization of
distinguished merit and is applying for admis-
sion as such. It is opposed to amateur, and as
used in the statute refers to one who pursues an
art and makes his living therefrom. U. S. ex rel.
Liebmann v. Flynn, D.C.N.Y., 16 F.2d 1006, 1007;
U. S. v. Commissioner of Immigration at Port of
New York, C.C.A.N.Y., 298 F. 449, 450.

## PROFESSIONAL EMPLOYMENT

Within the
meaning of a statute authorizing actions for mis-
conduct or neglect, professional services by an at-
torney are not limited to litigation, but include
giving advice, managing a business, devising
plans, and making collections, and the employ-
ment may be recognized as professional, although
including services not ordinarily classed as pro-
fessional services; whether the attorney is pro-
fessionally employed depending on the relations
and mutual understanding of what was said and
done, and on all the facts and circumstances
the particular undertaking. Case v. Ranney, 174
Mich. 673, 140 N.W. 943, 946.

## PROFESSOR

Public teacher of any science or
branch of learning. U. S. ex rel. Jacovides v.
Day, C.C.A.N.Y., 32 F.2d 542, 543.

## PROFICUA

L. Lat. In old English law. Profits;
especially the "issues and profits" of an estate in
land. Co.Litt. 142.

## PROFILE

In civil engineering, a drawing rep-
resenting the elevation of the various points on
the plan of a road, or the like, above some fixed
elevation. Pub.St.Mass.1882, p. 1294. A side or
sectional elevation, or a drawing showing a verti-
cal section of the ground along a surveyed line
or graded work. Also, an outline or contour.
Taggart v. Great Northern Ry. Co., D.C.Wash.,
208 F. 455, 456. As used in Act March 3, 1875, c.
152, § 1, 18 St. 482 (43 U.S.C.A. § 934), granting
rights of way through the public lands to rail-
roads, the term, in view of regulations of the gen-
eral land office, may be deemed to mean a map of
alignment or of definite location. Taggart v.
Great Northern Ry. Co., C.C.A.Wash., 211 F. 288,
PROFIT. The advance in the price of goods sold
beyond the cost of purchase. The gain made by
the sale of produce or manufactures, after de-
ducting the value of the labor, materials, rents,
and all expenses, together with the interest of
the capital employed. Webster. Lapham v. Tax
Com'r, 244 Mass. 40, 138 N.E. 708, 710; McCready
v. Bullis, 59 Cal.App. 286, 210 P. 638, 640. Gain
realized from business or investment over and
above expenditures. Citizens Nat. Bank v. Corl,
225 N.C. 96, 33 S.E.2d 613, 616. Fairchild v. Gray,
242 N.Y.S. 192, 196, 136 Misc. 704. An excess
of the value of returns over the value of advances.
The same as net profits. Crawford v. Surety Inv.
Co., 91 Kan. 748, 139 P. 481, 484.
The term "profit," as applied to a corporation, has a
larger meaning than "dividends," and covers benefits of
any kind, the excess of value over cost, acquisition beyond
expenditure, gain or advance. Booth v. Gross, Kelley &
Co., 30 N.M. 465, 238 P. 829, 831, 41 A.L.R. 868. Dividends
are properly declared only from profits after they have
been earned. Indiana Veneer & Lumber Co. v. Hageman,
57 Ind.App. 668, 105 N.E. 253, 256. This is a word of very
extended signification. In commerce, it means the ad-
vance in the price of goods sold beyond the cost of pur-
chase. In distinction from the wages of labor, it is well
understood to imply the net return to the capital of stock
employed, after deducting all the expenses, including not
only the wages of those employed by the capitalist, but the
wages of the capitalist himself for superintending the em-
ployment of his capital or stock. Columbus Mining Co. v.
Ross, 218 Ky. 98, 290 S. W. 1052, 1053, 50 A.L.R. 1394. After
indemnifying the capitalist for his outlay, there commonly
remains a surplus, which is his profit, the net income from
his capital. 1 Mill, Polit. Econ. c. 15.
Profits have been divided by writers on political economy
into gross and net,—gross profits being the whole difference
between the value of advances and the value of returns
made by their employment, and net profits being so much
of that difference as is attributable solely to the capital
employed. Malthus, Political Econ.; M'Culloch, Political
Econ. 563. For judicial criticism of the expression "gross
profits," see the opinion of Jesse!, M. R., 10 App.Cas. 446.
See, also, Buie v. Kennedy, 164 N. C. 290, 80 S.E. 445, 446.
The benefit, advantage, or pecuniary gain ac-
cruing to the owner or occupant of land from its
actual use; as in the familiar phrase "rents, is-
sues and profits," or in the expression "mesne
profits."
A devise of the rents and profits of land is equivalent to
a devise of the land itself, and will carry the legal as well
as the beneficial interest therein. 2 B. & Ald. 42; Earl v.
Rowe, 35 Me. 414, 58 Am.Dec. 714; 1 Bro.C.C. 310.
A division sometimes made of incorporeal here-
ditaments. 2 Steph.Comm. 2. Profits are divided
into profits a prendre and profits a rendre. See
those titles, infra.
Clear profit. A net profit, or a profit above
the price paid. Kreitz v. Gallenstein, 170 Ky. 16,
185 S.W. 132, 134.
Mesne profits. Intermediate profits; that is,
profits which have been accruing between two
given periods. Thus, after a party has recovered
the land itself in an action of ejectment, he fre-
quently brings another action for the purpose of
recovering the profits which have been accruing or
arising out of the land between the time when his
title to the possession accrued or was raised and
the time of his recovery in the action of ejectment,
and such an action is thence termed an "action
for mesne profits." Brown; New York, 0. & W.
Ry. Co. v. Livingston, 206 App.Div. 589, 201 N.Y.S.
629, 633.
Mesne profits, action of. An action of trespass
brought to recover profits derived from land, while
the possession of it has been improperly withheld;
that is, the yearly value of the premises. Worth-
ington v. Hiss, 70 Md. 172, 16 A. 534; Thompson
v. Bower, 60 Barb. (N.Y.) 477.
Net profits. Theoretically all profits are "net."
Buie v. Kennedy, 164 N.C. 290, 80 S.E. 445, 446.
But as the expression "gross profits" is sometimes
used to describe the mere excess of present value
over former value, or of returns from sales over
prime cost, the phrase "net profits" is appropriate
to describe the gain which remains after the
further deduction of all expenses, charges, costs,
allowance for depreciation, etc.
Paper profits. Speculative or prospective prof-
its. Tooey v. C. L. Percival Co., 192 Iowa, 267,
182 N.W. 403, 404.
Profit a prendre. Called also "right of com-
mon." A right exercised by one man in the soil
of another, accompanied with participation in the
profits of the soil thereof. A right to take a part
of the soil or produce of the land. Gadow v. Hun-
holtz, 160 Wis. 293, 151 N.W. 810, 811, Ann.Cas.
1917D, 91.
The term includes the right to take soil, gravel, minerals,
and the like from another's land, Munsey v. Mills & Garit-
ty, 115 Tex. 469, 283 S. W. 754, 759; Mathews Slate Co. of
New York v. Advance Industrial Supply Co., 172 N.Y.S. 830,
832, 185 App.Div. 74; the right to take seaweed, Hill v.
Lord, 48 Me. 100; and to take coal or timber, Huff v. Mc-
Cauley, 53 Pa. 206, 91 Am.Dec. 203; the right to hunt, St.
Helen Shooting Club v. Mogle, 234 Mich. 60, 207 N.W. 915,
917; or fish, Turner v. Hebron, 22 A. 951, 61 Conn. 175,
14 L.R.A. 386; and the right to cut grass, Baker v. Ken-
ney, 145 Iowa 638, 124 N.W. 901, 139 Am.St.Rep. 456; but
not the right to take running water, since it is not a prod-
uct of the soil. Hill v7"tord, 48 Me. 83. Profits a prendre
differ from easements, in that the former are rights of
out profit. Gale, Easem. 1; Hall. Bingham v. Salene, 15
Or. 208, 14 P. 523, 3 Am.St.Rep. 152; Pierce v. Keator, 70
N.Y. 422, 26 Am.Rep. 612. A profit a prendre is considered
an interest or estate in the land itself, 28 C.J.S., Ease-
ments, 628, 631, § 3, whereas an easement is a privilege
without profit. Walker v. Dwelle, 187 Iowa 1384, 175 N.W.
957. Saratoga State Waters Corporation v. Pratt, 227 N.Y.
429, 125 N.E. 834. 838. But a profit a prendre is sometimes
spoken of as an easement, especially when appurtenant to
a dominant tenement. Grubb v. Grubb, 74 Pa. 25, 33. The
right can be acquired only by grant or prescription, and
not by custom or parol. 28 C.J.S., Easements, 628, 633, § 3.
Council v. Sanderlin, 183 N.C. 253, 111 S.E. 365, 367, 32 A.
L.R. 1527.
Profit a rendre. Such as is received at the hands
of and rendered by another. The term compre-
hends rents and services. Ham.N.P. 192.
Profit and loss. The gain or loss arising from
goods bought or sold, or from carrying on any oth-
er business, the former of which, in book-keeping,
is placed on the creditor's side; the latter on the
debtor's side.
Surplus profits. Within the meaning of a stat-
ute prohibiting the declaration of corporate divi-
dends other than from such profits, the excess of
receipts over expenditures, or net earnings or re-
ceipts, or gross receipts, less expenses of opera-
tion. Southern California Home Builders v.
Young, 45 Cal.App. 679, 188 P. 586, 591. Of a cor-
poration, the difference over and above the capital
stock, debts, and liabilities. Western & Southern
Fire Ins. Co. v. Murphey, 56 Okl. 702, 156 P. 885,
PROFITEERING. The acquisition of excessive
profits;—usually used as a term of reproach and
dishonor. Mount v. Welsh, 118 Or. 568, 247 P.
815, 822.

## PROGENER

Lat. In the civil law. A grandson-
in-law. Dig. 38, 10, 4, 6.

## PROGRESSION

That state of a business which
is neither the commencement nor the end. Some
act done after the matter has commenced, and
before it is completed. Plowd. 343.

## PROHIBETUR NE QUIS FACIAT IN SUO QUOD NOCERE POSSIT ALIENO

It is forbidden for
any one to do or' make on his own [land] what
may injure another's. 9 Coke, 59a.

## PROHIBIT

To forbid by law; to prevent;—not
synonymous with "regulate." Simpkins v. State,
35 Okl.Cr. 143, 249 P. 168, 170; Arkansas Railroad
Commission v. Independent Bus Lines, 172 Ark.
3, 285 S.W. 388, 390.

## PROHIBITED DEGREES

Those degrees of re-
lationship by consanguinity which are so close
that marriage between persons related to each
other in any of such degrees is forbidden by law.
State v. Guiton, 51 La.Ann. 155, 24 So. 784.

## PROHIBITIO DE VASTO, DIRECTA PARTI

A
judicial writ which was formerly addressed to a
tenant, prohibiting him from waste, pending suit.
Reg.Jud. 21; Moore, 917.
v. Casualty Co., 74 Md. 545, 22 A. 395, 13 L.R.A.
In practice. The name of a writ issued by a su-
perior court, directed to the judge and parties of
a suit in an inferior court, commanding them to
cease from the prosecution of the same, upon a
suggestion that the cause originally, or some col-
lateral matter arising therein, does not belong
to that jurisdiction, but to the cognizance of some
other court. 3 B1.Comm. 112; Alexander v. Crol-
lott, 199 U.S. 580, 26 S.Ct. 161, 50 L.Ed. 317. It
is only issued in cases of extreme necessity where
the grievance cannot be redressed by ordinary pro-
ceedings at law, or in equity, or by appeal. Niaga-
ra Falls Power Co. v. Halpin, 45 N.Y.S.2d 421, 424,
181 Misc. 13; State ex rel. Levy v. Savord, 143
Ohio St. 451, 55 N.E.2d 735, 736.
An extraordinary writ, issued by a superior court to an
inferior court to prevent the latter from exceeding its juris-
diction, either by prohibiting it from assuming jurisdiction
in a matter over which it has no control, or from going be-
yond its legitimate powers in a matter of which it ha's
jurisdiction. State v. Medler, 19 N.M. 252, 142 P. 376, 377.
An extraordinary judicial writ issuing out of a court of
superior jurisdiction, directed to an inferior court or tri-
bunal exercising judicial powers, for the purpose of pre-
venting the inferior tribunal from usurping a jurisdiction
with which it is not lawfully vested, State v. Stanfield, 11
Okl.Cr. 147, 143 P. 519, 522; from assuming or exercising
jurisdiction over matters beyond its cognizance, Jackson v.
Calhoun, 156 Ga. 756, 120 S.E. 114, 115; or from exceeding
its jurisdiction in matters of which it has cognizance.
Jackson v. Calhoun, 156 Ga. 756, 120 S.E. 114, 115.
The writ of prohibition is the counterpart of the writ
of mandate. It arrests the proceedings of any tribunal,
corporation, board, or person, when such proceedings are
without or in excess of the jurisdiction of such tribunal,
corporation, board, or person. Code Civ.Proc.Cal. § 1102.
State v. Packard, 32 N.D. 301, 155 N.W. 666, 667. Johnston
v. Hunter, 50 W.Va. 52, 40 S.E. 448. State v. Evans, 88
Wis. 255, 60 N.W. 433.
Prohibition may, where the action sought to be prohibit-
ed is judicial in its nature, be exercised against public
officers. State ex rel. United States Fidelity & Guaranty
Co. v. Harty, 276 Mo. 583, 208 S. W. 835, 838.
The term prohibition is also applied to the inter-
diction of making, possessing, selling or giving
away, intoxicating liquors, either absolutely, or
for beverage purposes, or for other than medic-
inal, scientific, and sacramental purpbses.

## PROHIBITIVE IMPEDIMENTS

SED PROLEM, QUAM MATRIMONIUM NON
PARIT, SUCCEDERE NON SINIT LEX AN-
GLORUM. Fortesc. c. 39. The civil law permits

of proletarii (see the next title) ; the lowest
stratum of the people of a country, consisting
mainly of the waste of other classes, or of those
fractions of the population who, by their isolation
and their poverty, have no place in the established
order of society.

## PROLETARIUS

zens who were so poor that they could not serve
the state with money, but only with their children,
(proles.) Calvin.; Vicat.

## PROLICIDE

who makes it, either in honor, conscience, or law,
to do or forbear a certain specific act, and which
gives to the person to whom made a right to ex-
pect or claim the performance of some particular
thing. Hoskins v. Black, 190 Ky. 98, 226 S.W. 384,
385. A declaration, verbal or written, made by
one person to another for a good or valuable con-
sideration, in the nature of a covenant by which
the promisor binds himself to do or forbear some
act, and gives to the proniisee a legal right to de-
mand and enforce a fulfillment. Scott v. S. H.
Kress & Co., Tex.Civ.App., 191 S.W. 714, 716. An
express undertaking, or agreement to carry a pur-

A.L.R. 238.
While a "promise" is sometimes loosely defined as a dec-
laration by any person of his intention to do or forbear
from anything at the request or for the use of another.
Finlay v. Swirsky, 103 Conn. 624, 131 A. 420, 423; Beck v.
Wilkins-Ricks Co., 186 N.C. 210, 119 S.E. 235, 236; it is to
be distinguished, on the one hand, from a mere declaration
of intention involving no engagement or assurance as to
the future. Scott v. S. H. Kress & Co., Tex.Civ.App., 191
S.W. 714, 716. And, on the other, from "agreement,"
which is an obligation arising upon reciprocal promises,
or upon a promise founded on a consideration. Abbott.
Strictly speaking a promise is not a representation; the
failure to make it good may give a cause of action, but it
is not a false representation, which will authorize the
rescission of a contract. Cunyus v. Guenther, 96 Ala. 564,
11 So. 649.
Fictitious promise. Sometimes called "implied
promises," or "promises implied in law," occur in
the case of those contracts which were invented
to enable persons in certain cases to take advan-
tage of the old rules of pleading peculiar to con-
tracts, and which are not now of practical im-
portance. Sweet.
Mutual promises. Promises simultaneously
made by and between two parties; each promise
being the consideration for the other. Anson
Contr. 72; 14 M. & W. 855.

Smith, 151 N.Y. 502, 45 N.E. 872.
New promise. An undertaking or promise,
based upon and having relation to a former prom-
ise which, for some reason, can no longer be en-
forced, whereby the promisor recognizes and re-
vives such former promise and engages to fulfill
it.
Parol promise. A simple contract; a verbal
promise. 2 Steph.Comm. 109.
Promise of marriage. A contract mutually en-
tered into by a man and a woman that they will
marry each other.
Promise to pay the debt of another. Within
the statute of frauds, a promise to pay the debt
of another is an undertaking by a person not be-
fore liable, for the purpose of securing or per-
forming the same duty for which the party for

promise; in the nature of a promise; stipulating
or engaging for a future act or course of conduct.
As to promissory "Oath," "Representation," and
"Warranty," see those titles.

## PROMISSORY ESTOPPEL

That which arises
when there is a promise which promisor should
reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance
of a definite and substantial character on part
of promisee, and which does induce such action
or forbearance, and such promise is binding if
injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of
promise. New Eureka Amusement Co. v. Rosin-
sky, 126 Pa.Super. 444, 191 A. 412, 415.
To constitute "waiver without consideration," there must
be promise or permission, express or implied in fact, sup-
ported only by action in reliance thereon, to excuse per-
formance in future of condition or obligation not due at
time when promise is made, or to give up defense not yet
arisen, and such facts do not constitute "estoppel" because
there is no misrepresentation of existing facts, but it may
be called "promissory estoppel." Colbath v. H. B. Steb-
bins Lumber Co., 127 Me. 406, 144 A. 1, 5.

## PROMISSORY NOTE

ment, in writing, to pay a specified sum at a time
therein limited, or on demand, or at sight, to a

v. Harrington, 267 Ill. 57, 107 N.E. 826, 828.
A written promise to pay a certain sum of money, at a
future time, unconditionally. Brooks v. Owen, 112 Mo. 251,
19 S.W. 723, 20 S.W. 492. By the Uniform Negotiable In-
struments Act, a negotiable promissory note is defined as
an unconditional promise in writing made by one person
to another signed by the maker engaging to pay on de-
mand, or at a fixed or determinable future time, a sum
certain in money to order or to bearer. Where a note is

cially; to make public as important or obliga-

## PROMULGATION

The order given to cause a
law to be executed, and to make it public; it
differs from publication. 1 Bl.Comm. 45; Stat.
6 Hen. VI. c. 4. In modern practice, it is usually
by publishing one or more volumes of the laws
and circulating them among public officials and
selling them. As to the practice in England at
various times, see Record Com. in 7 Sel. Essays
in Anglo-Amer. L. H. 168.
As to the rules of a railway company it means
made known; brought to the attention of the

N.Y.S. 768.
Formerly promulgation meant introducing a
bill to the senate; Aust. Jur. Lect, 28.

## PROMUTUUM

Lat. In the civil law. A quasi
contract, by which he who receives a certain sum
of money, or a certain quantity of fungible things,
,
which have been paid to him through mistake,
contracts towards the payer the obligation of re-
turning him as much. Poth, de l'Usure, pt. 3, s.
1, a. 1.
This contract is called promutuum, because it has much
resemblance to that of mutuum. This resemblance consists
in this : first, that in both a sum of money or some fungi-
ble things are required; second, that in both there must be
a transfer of the property in the thing ; third, that in both
there must be returned the same amount or quantity of the
thing received. But, though there is this general resem-
blance between the two, the mutuum differs essentially
from the promutuum. The former is the actual contract
of the parties, made expressly, but the latter is a quasi-
contract, which is the effect of an error or mistake, 1
Bouvier, Inst. n. 1125.

grandson. Inst. 3, 6, 1; Bract. fol. 67.

the affirmative or negative of any proposition.
Nauful v. National Loan & Exchange Bank of
Columbia, 111 S.C. 309, 97 S.E. 843, 845. The con-
viction or persuasion of the mind of a judge or
jury, by the exhibition of evidence, of the reality
of a fact alleged. Ellis v. Wolfe-Shoemaker Mo-
tor Co., 227 Mo.App. 508, 55 S.W.2d 309.
"Testimony" is a more restricted term. For
"Testimony," see that title.
Ayliffe defines "judicial proof" to be a clear and evident
declaration or demonstration of a matter which was before
doubtful, conveyed in a judicial manner by fit and proper
arguments, and likewise by all other legal methods—First,
by flt and proper arguments, such as conjectures, presump-
tions, indicia, and other adminicular ways and means;
secondly, by legal methods, or methods according to law,
such as witnesses, public instruments, and the like. Ayl.
Par. 442.
Evidence and Proof Distinguished
"Proof" is the logically sufficient reason for assenting to
the truth of a proposition advanced. In its juridical sense
it is a term of wide import, and comprehends everything
that may be adduced at a trial, within the legal rules, for
the purpose of producing conviction in the mind of judge
or jury, aside from mere argument; that is, everything
that has a probative force intrinsically, and not merely as
a deduction from, or combination of, original probative
facts. But "evidence" is a narrower term, and includes
only such kinds of proof as may be legally presented at a
trial, by the act of the parties, and through the aid of such
concrete facts as witnesses, records, or other documents.
Thus, to urge a presumption of law in support of one's
case is adducing proof, but it is not offering evidence.
"Belief" is a subjective condition resulting from proof. It
is a conviction of the truth of a proposition, existing in
the mind, and induced by persuasion, proof, or argument
addressed to the judgment.
The word "proof" seems properly to mean anything
which serves, either immediately or mediately, to convince
the mind of the truth or falsehood of a fact or proposition.
It is also applied to the conviction generated in the mind
by proof properly so called. The word "evidence" signi-
fies, in its original sense, the state of being evident, i. e.,
plain, apparent, or notorious. But by an almost peculiar
inflection of our language, it is applied to that which tends
to render evident or to generate proof. Best, Ev. §§ 10, 11;
Dupont v. Pelletier, 120 Me. 114, 113 A. 11, 12. "Evidence"
differs from "proof" in that former may be false and of no
probative value. State v. Howard, 162 La. 719, 111 So. 72,
Proof in a strictly accurate and technical sense is the re-
sult or effect of evidence, while evidence is the medium
or means by which a fact is proved or disproved, but the
words "proof" and "evidence" may be used interchange-
ably. Walker v. State, 138 Ark. 517, 212 S.W. 319, 324;
Latikos v. State, 17 Ala.App. 592, 88 So. 45, 47.
"Proof" is only link in chain of evidence relating to
single thing or statement of single witness, and it is these
links relating to entire proof which go to make up evi-
dence. Cleveland Metal Bed Co. v. Kutz, 27 Ohio App. 245,
160 N.E. 725, 726.
Proof is the conclusion drawn from the evidence, Jones
v. Clements, Tex.Civ.App., 41 S.W.2d 1069, 1070; it is the
effect of evidence. State v. Crutcher, 231 Iowa 418, 1 N.W.
2d 195, 198. Sims v. Clayton, 193 S.C. 98, 7 S.E.2d 724, 728.
Proof is the perfection of evidence; for without evidence
there is no proof, although there may be evidence which
does not amount to proof : for example, if a man is found
murdered at a spot where another has been seen walking
but a short time before, this fact will be evidence to show
that the latter was the murderer, but, standing alone, will
be very far from proof of it.
"Proof," when used in a legislative enactment means com-
petent and legal evidence, testimony conforming to funda-
mental rules of proof, excluding hearsay evidence, however
trustworthy. Hand v. Nolan, 1 N.J.Misc. 428, 136 A. 430,
No material difference between terms exists for purposes
of instruction. Merrick v. United Rys. & Electric Co. of
Baltimore City, 163 Md. 641, 163 A. 816, 818.
Affirmative proof. Evidence establishing the
fact in dispute by a preponderance of the evi-
dence. Boardman v. Lorentzen, 155 Wis. 566, 145
N.W. 750, 755, 52 L.R.A.,N.S., 476.
Burden of proof. See that title.
Conclusive proof. As used in a statute provid-
ing for an action against a county for injury to
cattle resulting from dipping for eradication of
cattle ticks, it has been held to be equivalent to the
expression, "to a moral certainty" or "beyond a
reasonable doubt," meaning a higher degree of
proof than by a preponderance of the evidence.
Covington County v. Fite, 120 Miss. 421, 82 So.
308, 309.
Degree of proof. Refers to effect of evidence
rather than medium by which truth is established,
and in this sense expressions "preponderance of
evidence" and "proof beyond reasonable doubt"
are used. Sowle v. Sowle, 115 Neb. 795, 215 N.W.
122, 123.
Full proof. See Full.
Half proof. See Half.
Negative proof. See Positive Proof, infra.
Positive proof. Direct or affirmative proof;
that which directly establishes the fact in ques-
tion; as opposed to negative proof, which estab-
lishes the fact by showing that its opposite is
not or cannot be true. Schrack v. McKnight, 84
Pa. 30.
Preliminary proof. See Preliminary.
Proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Such proof
as precludes every reasonable hypothesis except
that which it tends to support and which is wholly
consistent with defendant's guilt and inconsistent
with any other rational conclusion. State v. Mc-
Donough, 129 Conn. 483, 29 A.2d 582, 583.
Proof evident or presumption great. As used
in constitutional provisions that accused shall
be bailable unless for capital offenses when the
"proof is evident" or "presumption great," means
evidence clear and strong, and which leads
well guarded, dispassionate judgment to conclu-
sion that accused committed offense and will be
punished capitally. Ex parte Coward, 145 Tex.
Cr.R. 593, 170 S.W.2d 754, 755. Ex parte Goode,
123 Tex.Cr.R. 492, 59 S.W.2d 841; Ex parte Tully,
70 Fla. 1, 66 So. 296, 297.
Proof of debt. The formal establishment by a
creditor of his debt or claim, in some prescribed
manner, (as, by his affidavit or otherwise,) as a
preliminary to its allowance, along with others,
against an estate or property to be divided, such
as the estate of a bankrupt or insolvent, a deceas-
ed person or a firm or company in liquidation.
Proof of spirits. Testing the strength of alco-
holic spirits, also the degree of strength; as high
proof, first proof, second, third, and fourth proofs.
In the internal revenue law it is used in the sense
of degree of strength. Louisville P. W. Co. v. Col-
lector of Customs, C.C.A.Ky., 49 F. 561, 1 C.C.A.
371, 6 U.S.App. 53.
Proof of will. A term having the same mean-
ing as "probate," (q. v.), and used interchange-
ably with it.

tion to advise with donor impartially and confiden-
tially as to consequences to donor of his proposed

essary party, is one who has an interest in the

conveniently settled therein; one without whom
a substantial decree may be made, but not a de-
cree which shall completely settle all the questions
which may be involved in the controversy and
conclude the rights of all the persons who have
any interest in the subject of the litigation. See

order for the protection of the wife's property,
when the husband has willfully deserted her, is-
suable by the divorce court under statutes on that
subject.

## PROTECTIONIBUS DE

The English statute 33
Edw. I. St. 1, allowing a challenge to be entered
against a protection, etc.

## PROTECTIVE TARIFF

A law imposing duties
on imports, with the purpose and the effect of
discouraging the use of products of foreign ori-
gin, and consequently of stimulating the home pro-
duction of the same or equivalent articles. R. E.
Thompson, in Enc.Brit.

## PROTECTOR OF SETTLEMENT

In English
law. By the statute 3 & 4 Wm. IV. c. 74, § 32,
power is given to any settlor to appoint any per-
son or persons, not exceeding three, the "protector
of the settlement." The object of such appoint-
ment is to prevent the tenant in tail from barring
any subsequent estate, the consent of the protector
being made necessary for that purpose.

## PROTECTORATE

A state which has transfer-
red the management of its more important inter-
national affairs to a stronger state. 1 Opp. 144;
Salmond, Juris. 210. It implies only a partial loss
of sovereignty, so that the protected state still re-
tains a position in the family of nations. More-
over, the protected state remains so far independ-
ent of its protector that it is not obliged to be a
party to a war carried on by the protector against
a third state, nor are treaties concluded by the
protector ipso facto binding upon the protected
state; 1 Opp. 145-146.
The period during which Oliver Cromwell ruled
in England. Also the office of protector.

## PROTEST

A formal declaration made by a per-
son interested or concerned in some act about to
be done, or already performed, whereby he ex-
presses his dissent or disapproval, or affirms the
act against his will. The object of such a dec-
laration is generally to save some right which
would be lost to him if his implied assent could
be made out, or to exonerate himself from some
responsibility which would attach to him unless
he expressly negatived his assent.
A notarial act, being a formal statement in
writing made by a notary under his seal of office,
at the request of the holder of a bill or note, in
which it is declared that the bill or note described
was on a certain day presented for payment, (or"
acceptance,) and that such payment or acceptance
was refused, and stating the reasons, if any, given
for such refusal, whereupon the notary protests
against all parties to such instrument, and de-
clares that they will be held responsible for all
loss or damage arising from its dishonor. Ann.-
vine Nat. Bank v. Kettering, 106 Pa. 531, 51 Am.
Rep. 536; Dennistoun v. Stewart, 17 How. 607, 15
L.Ed. 228. It denotes also all the steps or acts ac-
companying dishonor necessary to charge an in-
dorser. Townsend v. Lorain Bank, 2 Ohio St. 345;
Piedmont Carolina Ry. Co. v. Shaw, C.C.A.N.C.,
223 F. 973, 977; Maury v. Winlock & Toledo Log-
ging & R. Co., 148 Wash. 572, 269 P. 815, 817.
A formal declaration made by a minority (or by
certain individuals) in a legislative body that they
dissent from some act or resolution of the body,
usually adding the grounds of their dissent. The
term, in this sense, seems to be particularly ap-
propriate to such a proceeding in the English
house of lords. Auditor General v. Board of
Sup'rs, 51 N.W. 483, 89 Mich. 552.
The formal statement, usually in writing, made
by a person who is called upon by public author-
ity to pay a sum of money, in which he declares
that he does not concede the legality or justice
of the claim or his duty to pay it, or that he dis-
putes the amount demanded; the object being to
save his right to recover or reclaim the amount,
which right would be lost by his acquiescence.
Thus, taxes may be paid under "protest." Meyer
v. Clark, 2 Daly (N.Y.) 509.
The name of a paper served on a collector of
customs by an importer of merchandise, stating
that he believes the sum charged as duty to be
excessive, and that, although he pays such sum
for the purpose of getting his goods out of the
custom-house, he reserves the right to bring an
action against the collector to recover the excess.
U. S. Lian, C.C.A.N.Y., 10 F.2d 41, 42.
In maritime law. A written statement by the
master of a vessel, attested by a proper judicial
officer or a notary, to the effect that damage suf-
fered by the ship on her voyage was caused by
storms or other perils of the sea, without any neg-
ligence or misconduct on his own part. Marsh.
Ins. 715. And see Cudworth v. South Carolina
Ins. Co., 4 Rich.Law, S.C., 416, 55 Am.Dec. 692.
Notice of protest. A notice given by the holder
of a bill or note to the drawer or indorser that
the bill has been protested for refusal of payment
or acceptance. First Nat. Bank v. Hatch, 78 Mo.
23; Roberts v. State Bank, 9 Port. (Ala.) 315.
Supra protest. In mercantile law. A term ap-
plied to an acceptance of a bill by a third person,
after protest for nonacceptance by the drawee. 3
Kent, Comm. 87.
Waiver of protest. As applied to a note or bill,
a waiver of protest implies not only dispensing
with the formal act known as "protest," but also
with that which ordinarily must precede it, viz.,
demand and notice of non-payment. Baker v.
Scott, 29 Kan. 136, 44 Am.Rep. 628; First Nat.
Bank v. Hartman, 110 Pa. 196, 2 A. 271.

Vin. Abr. Trebilcox v. McAlpine, 46 Hun, N.Y.,
469; Whitney v. Hopkins, 19 A. 1075, 135 Pa. 246.

White, New Recop. lib. 3, tit. 7, c. 5, § 2.
The term "protocolo," when applied to a single paper,
means the first draft of an instrument duly executed be-
fore a notary—the matrix,—because it is the source from
which must be taken copies to be delivered to interested
parties as their evidence of right; and it also means a
bound book in which the notary places and keeps in their
order instruments executed before him, from which copies
are taken for the use of parties interested. Downing v.
Diaz, 80 Tex. 436, 16 S.W. 53.

## PROTUTOR

lish the general opinion that, because of its loca-
tion in relation to them, oil is contained in it.
Minchew v. Morris, Tex.Civ.App., 241 S.W. 215,
PROVER. In old Englsh law. A person who,

presses a condition; but this is not invariable,
for, according to the context, it may import a cov-

straint, modification, or exception to something
which precedes. Stanley v. Colt, 5 Wall. 166, 18
L.Ed. 502; Robertson v. Caw, 3 Barb., N.Y., 418;

the sovereign, and also to certain other ordinances
or declarations having the force of law. See

A term used in the reign of Henry III. to designate en-
actments of the King in Council, perhaps less solemn than
statutes. The term "statutes" was a later term, with a
changed conception of the solemnity of a statute, and is
one that cannot easily be defined. It came into use in Ed-
ward I.'s reign, supplanting "provisions," which is char-
acteristic of Henry III.'s reign, which had supplanted "as-
size," characteristic of the reigns of Henry II., Richard
and John Maitland, 2 Sel. Essays in Anglo-Am. Leg. Hist.
so.

## PROVISIONAL ORDER

In English law. Under
various acts of parliament, certain public bodies
and departments of the government are author-
ized to inquire into matters which, in the ordinary
course, could only be dealt with by a private act
of parliament, and to make orders for their regu-
lation. These orders have no effect unless they
are confirmed by an act of parliament, and are
hence called "provisional orders." Several orders
may be confirmed by one act. The object of this
mode of proceeding is to save the trouble and ex-
pense of promoting a number of private bills.
Sweet.

## PROVISIONAL REMEDY

A remedy provided
for present need or for the immediate occasion;
one adapted to meet a particular exigency. Par-
ticularly, a temporary process available to a plain-
tiff in a civil action, which secures him against
loss, irreparable injury, dissipation of the prop-
erty, etc., while the action is pending. Such are
the remedies by injunction, appointment of a re-
ceiver, attachment, or arrest. The term is chiefly
used in the codes of practice. Snavely v. Abbott
Buggy Co., 36 Kan. 106, 12 P. 522.

Or. 680, 196 P. 379, 380. The word does not include
a mulch cow; Wilson v. McMillan, 80 Ga. 733, 6
S.E. 182; nor cotton; Butler v. Shiver, 79 Ga. 172,
4 S.E..115.

## PROVISO

A condition or provision which is in-
serted in a deed, lease, mortgage, or contract, and
on the performance or nonperformance of which
the validity of the instrument frequently depends;
it usually begins with the word "provided."
It always implies a condition, unless subsequent words
change it to a covenant, Rich v. Atwater, 16 Conn. 419 ; but
when a proviso contains the mutual words of the parties
to a deed, it amounts to a covenant. 2 Co. 72 ; Cro.Eliz.
The word "proviso" is generally taken for a condition,
but it differs from it in several respects ; for a condition
'Is usually created by the grantor or lessor, but a proviso
by the grantee or lessee. Jacob.
The mere use of technical terms which ordinarily denote
a limitation or a condition subsequent is an unsafe test of
the true nature of the estate granted ; the word "proviso"
or "provided" itself being sometimes taken as a condition,
sometimes as a limitation, and sometimes as a covenant.
Stevens v. Galveston H. & S. A. Ry. Co., Tex.Com.App., 212
S. W. 639, 644.
A limitation or exception to a grant made or
authority conferred, the effect of which is to de-
clare that the one shall not operate, or the other
be exercised, unless in the case provided. Clear-
water Tp. v. Board of Sup'rs of Kalkaska County,
187 Mich. 516, 153 N.W. 824, 827.
A clause or part of a clause in a statute, the
office of which is either to except something from
the enacting clause, or to qualify or restrain its
generality, or to exclude some possible ground of
misinterpretation of its extent. Cox v. Hart, 260
U.S. 427, 43 S.Ct. 154, 157, 67 L.Ed. 332; Riley
Pennsylvania Oil Co. v. Symmonds, 195 Mo.App.
111, 190 S.W. 1038, 1040. Strain v. East Bay Mu-
nicipal Utility Dist., 21 Cal.App.2d 281, 69 P.2d
191, 193.
A proviso is sometimes misused to introduce independent
pieces of legislation. Cox v. Hart, 43 S.Ct. 154, 157, 260
U.S. 427, 67 L.Ed. 332. Its proper use, however, is to
qualify what is affirmed in the body of the act, section, or
paragraph preceding it, or to except something from the
act, but not to enlarge the enacting clause. State Public
Utilities Commission v. Early, 285 Ill. 469, 121 N.E. 63, 66;
And it cannot be held to enlarge the scope of the statute ;
Jordan v. Town of South Boston, 138 Va. 838, 122 S.E. 265,
While a proviso is commonly found at the end of the
act or section, and is usually introduced by the word
"provided," that word is not necessary, the matter and not
the form of the succeeding words controlling. Mackenzie
v. Douglas County, 81 Or. 442, 159 P. 625, 627.
The proper use of provisoes in drafting acts is explained
by Coode on Legislative Construction. The early, and, as
he thinks, the correct use, is by way of taking special cases
out of general enactments and providing for them. The
courts have generally assumed that such was the proper
mode of using a proviso. It is incorrectly used to introduce
mere exceptions to the operation of the enactment where
no special provision is made for the exception; these are
better expressed as exceptions.
Exception and proviso distinguished. See Ex-
ception.
PROVISO EST PROVIDERE PRAESENTIA ET
FUTURA, NON PR1ETERITA. Coke, 72; Vaugh.
279. A proviso is to provide for the present or fu-
ture, not the past.

## PROVISO, TRIAL BY

In English practice. A
trial brought on by the defendant, in cases where
the plaintiff, after issue joined, neglects to pro-
ceed to trial; so called from a clause in the writ
to the sheriff, which directs him, in case two writs
come to his hands, to execute but one of them.
3 Bl. Comm. 357. The defendant may take out a
venire facias to the sheriff, which hath in it these
words, Proviso quod, etc., provided that if the
plaintiff shall take out any writ to that purpose,
the sheriff shall summon but one jury on them

benefices, and declaring that the election of bish-
ops and other dignitaries should be free, and all
rights of patrons preserved. Taswell-Langmead,
Engl. Constit. Hist. 322. See Pr munire.

## PROVOCATION

The act of inciting another to
do a particular deed. That which arouses, moves,
calls forth, causes, or occasions. Manson v. State,
14 Ga.App. 837, 82 S.E. 763, 764.
Such conduct or actions on the part of one per-
son towards another as tend to arouse rage, re-
sentment, or fury in the latter against the former,
and thereby cause him to do some illegal act
against or in relation to the person offering the
provocation. State v. Byrd, 52 S.C. 480, 30 S.E.
"Provocation" which will reduce killing to manslaughter
must be of such character as will, in mind of average rea-
sonable man, stir resentment likely to cause violence, ob-
scure the reason, and lead to action from passion rather
than judgment. Wooten v. State, 171 Tenn. 362, 103 S.W.
2d 324, 326. There must be a state of passion without time
to cool placing defendant beyond control of his reason.
Commonwealth v. Geld, 282 Pa. 434, 128 A. 77, 79. Provo-
cation carries with it the idea of some physical aggression
or some assault which suddenly arouses heat and passion
in the person assaulted. State v. Hollis, 108 S.C. 442, 95
S.E. 74, 76.

The law on this
point arises only where deceased was the attack-
ing party, and his attack was brought about by the
words or acts of accused, intended to bring on
the attack, in order that advantage might be taken
thereof by him to slay his adversary and escape
the consequences. Carter v. State, 87 Tex.Cr.R.
200, 220 S.W. 335, 336.
burgh in Scotland. A governing officer of certain
universities or colleges. The chief dignitary of a

cient intervening cause, produces the injury, and
without which the result would not have occurred.

responsible causation. Butcher v. R. Co., 37 W.
Va. 180, 16 S.E. 457, 18 L.R.A. 519. That which
stands next in causation to the effect, not neces-
sarily in time or space but in causal relation.
Cundiff v. City of Owensboro, 193 Ky. 168, 235
S.W. 15, 16; Carlock v. Denver & R. G. R. Co., 55
Colo. 146, 133 P. 1103, 1104. The last negligent act
contributory to an injury, without which such
injury would not have resulted. Estep v. Price, 93
W.Va. 81, 115 S.E. 861, 863. The dominant cause.
Ballagh v. Interstate Business Men's Acc. Ass'n,
176 Iowa 110, 155 N.W. 241, 244, L.R.A.1917A, 1050;
The moving or producing cause. Eberhardt v.
Glasco Mut. Tel. Ass'n, 91 Kan. 763, 139 P. 416, 417,
Buchanan v. Hurd Creamery Co., 215 Iowa 415, 246
N.W. 41. The efficient cause; the one that neces-
sarily sets the other causes in operation. Balti-
more & 0. R. Co. v. Ranier, 84 Ind.App. 542, 149
N.E. 361, 364. The causes that are merely inci-
dental or instruments of a superior or controlling
agency are not the proximate causes and the re-
sponsible ones, though they may be nearer in time
to the result. It is only when the causes are inde-
pendent of each other that the nearest is, of
course, to be charged with the disaster. Blythe v.
Railway Co., 15 Colo. 333, 25 P. 702, 11 L.R.A. 615,
22 Am.St.Rep. 403; act or omission immediately
sion occurring or concurring with another, which,
had it not happened, injury would not have been
inflicted. Herron v. Smith Bros., 116 Cal.App. 518,
2 P.2d 1012, 1013.
"Proximate cause" is distinguishable from "immediate
cause." Missouri, K. & T. Ry. Co. of Texas v. Cardwell,
Tex.Civ.App., 187 S.W. 1073, 1076. The immediate cause
is generally referred to in the law as the nearest cause in
point of time and space, while an act or omission may be
the proximate cause of an injury without being the imme-
diate cause. Thus, where several causes combine to pro-
duce an injury, the last intervening cause is commonly re-
ferred to as the immediate cause, although some other
agency more remote in time or space may, in causal rela-
tion, be the nearer to the result, and thus be the proximate
responsible cause. Dunbar v. Davis, 32 Ga.App. 192, 122 S.
E. 895, citing, among others, Insurance Co. v. Boon, 95 U.
S. 117, 130, 24 L.Ed. 395; Terry Shipbuilding Corp. v. Grit-
flan, 112 S.E. 374, 153 Ga. 390. Moreover, there may be
two or more proximate causes, but only one immediate
cause. Thomas v. Chicago Embossing Co., 307 Ill. 134,
138 N.E. 285, 287; American Stone Ballast Co. v. Mar-
shall's Adm'r, 206 Ky. 133, 266 S.W. 1051, 1052. But the
two terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Wilczyn-
ski v. Milwaukee Electric Ry. & Light Co., 171 Wis. 508, 177
N.W. 876, 877; but see Wright v. Greenwood Telephone
Co., 108 S.C. 84, 93 S.E. 398, 399; Knight v. Wessler, 67
Utah, 354, 248 P. 132, 133. See, also, Immediate Cause.
PROXIMATE CONSEQUENCE OR RESULT.
One which succeeds naturally in the ordinary
course of things. Swaim v. Chicago, R. I. & P.
Ry. Co., 187 Iowa 466, 174 N.W. 384, 386. A conse-
quence which, in addition to being in the train
of physical causation, is not entirely outside the
range of expectation or probability, as viewed by
ordinary men. The Mars, D.C.N.Y., 9 F.2d 183,
184. One ordinarily following from the negligence
complained of, unbroken by any independent
cause, which might have been reasonably fore-
seen. One which a prudent and experienced man,
fully acquainted with all the circumstances which
in fact existed, would, at time of the negligent
act, have thought reasonably possible to follow, if
it had occurred to his mind. Coast S. S. Co. v.
Brady, C.C.A.Ala., 8 F.2d 16, 19. A mere possibil-
ity of the injury is not sufficient, where a reason-
able man would not consider injury likely to re-
sult from the act as one of its ordinary and prob-
able results.

## PROXIMATE DAMAGES

## PROXIMATELY

Directly or immediately. Ken-
tucky Traction & Terminal Co. v. Bain, 161 Ky. 44,

result, no independent disturbing agency inter-
vening. Weaver v. Landis, 66 Cal.App.2d 34, 151

## PRUDENCE

Carefulness, precaution, attentive-
ness, and good judgment, as applied to action or
conduct. That degree of care required by the
exigencies or circumstances under which it is to
be exercised. Cronk v. Railway Co., 52 N.W. 420,
3 S.D. 93. This term, in the language of the law,
is commonly associated with "care" and "dili-
gence" and contrasted with "negligence." See
those titles.

onymous with cautious. Malcolm v. Mooresville
Cotton Mills, 191 N.C. 727, 133 S.E. 7, 9; Hurley
v. Gus Blass Co., 191 Ark. 917, 88 S.W.2d 850, 851.

5 Coke, 49. He acts prudently
who obeys the command of the law.

## PRUDENTIAL AFFAIRS

Within the meaning
of a statute authorizing the making of by-laws

the inhabitants. Clarke v. City of Fall River, 219
Mass. 580, 107 N.E. 419, 421.

## PRUDHOMMES, PRODES HOMMES

This wor
was used in early Norman times, and before, in
a general sense to signify freeholders or respect-
able burgesses; sometimes a special body of such
persons acting as magistrates or judges. Black
Book of Adm. IV, 186. There were prudhommes
of the sea; of merchants; of the corporation of
Barcelona; and of the gild of coopers. Usually
two sat.

der conceit and suspiciousness, or lack of common
sense, social feeling, self-control, truthfulness, en-
ergy, or persistence. Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Frost,

tion with) the administration of drugs or other

loidal product of the decomposition or putrefac-
tion of albuminous substances, as, in animal and
vegetable tissues. Ptomaines are sometimes poi-
sonous, but not invariably. Examples of poison-

fish and the tyrotoxicons of decomposing milk and
milk products. They are sometimes found in a
less harmful form in preserved vegetable matter.
Drury v. Armour & Co., 140 Ark. 371, 216 S.W. 40,
PUBERTY. The earliest age at which persons

Ayliffe, Pand. 63; Toullier, Dr. Civ. Fr. tom. 5, p.
100; Inst. 1, 22; Dig. 1, 7, 40, 1; Code 5, 60, 3;

People v. Turnbull, 184 Ill.App. 151, 155; Com-
monwealth v. Bosworth, 257 Mass. 212, 153 N.E.
455, 457. In one sense, everybody; and according-
ly the body of the people at large; the communi-
ty at large, without reference to the geographical
limits of any corporation like a city, town, or
county; the people. In another sense the word
does not mean all the people, nor most of the
people, nor very many of the people of a place,
but so many of them as contradistinguishes them
from a few. Accordingly, it has been defined or
employed as meaning the inhabitants of a par-
ticular place; all the inhabitants of a particular
place; the people of the neighborhood. People v.
Powell, 280 Mich. 699, 274 N.W. 372, 373, 111 A.L.
R. 721; State ex rel. Maher v. Baker, 88 Ohio St.

gan v. Creep 46 Vt. 786, 14 Am.Rep. 640; Crane v.
Waters, C.C.Mass., 10 F. 621. Belonging to the

people of a state, nation, or community; not limit-
ed or restricted to any particular class of the
community. People v. Powell, 280 Mich. 699, 274
N.W. 372, 373, 111 A.L.R. 721.
A distinction has been made between the terms "public"
and "general." They are sometimes used as synonymous.
The former term is applied strictly to that which concerns
all the citizens and every member of the state ; while the
latter includes a lesser, though still a large, portion of the
community. 1 Greenl.Ev. § 128.

which are to be filled by the appointment of in-
dividuals, under authority of law, instead of by
election.
Public building. One of which the possession
and use, as well as the property in it, are in the
public. Pancoast v. Troth, 34 N.J.Law, 383. Any
building held, used, or controlled exclusively for
public purposes by any department or branch of
government, state, county, or municipal, without
reference to the ownership of the building or of
the realty upon which it is situated. Shepherd v.
State, 16 Ga.App. 248, 85 S.E. 83. A building be-
longing to or used by the public for the transac-
tion of public or quasi public business. Lewis
v. Commonwealth, 197 Ky. 449, 247 S.W. 749, 750.
Public character. An individual who asks for
and desires public recognition, such as a states-
man, author, artist, or inventor. Corliss v. E. W.
Walker Co., C.C.Mass., 64 F. 280, 31 L.R.A. 283.
Public convenience. In a statute requiring the
issuance of a certificate of public convenience and
necessity by the Public Utilities Commission for
the operation of a motorbus line, "convenience"
is not used in its colloquial sense as synonymous
with handy Qr easy of access, but in accord with
its regular meaning of suitable and fitting, and
"public convenience" refers to something fitting
or suited to the public need. Abbott v. Public
Utilities Commission, 48 R.I. 196, 136 A. 490, 491.
Public interest. Something in which the public,
the community at large, has some pecuniary in-
terest, or some interest by which their legal rights
or liabilities are affected. It does not mean any-
thing so narrow as mere curiosity, or as the in-
terests of the particular localities, which may be
affected by the matters in question. State v.
Crockett, 86 Okl. 124, 206 P. 816, 817.
If by public permission one is making use of public
property and he chances to be the only one with whom the
public can deal with respect to the use of that property, his
business is affected with a public interest which requires
him to deal with the public on reasonable terms. Cooley,
Const.Lim. 746. The circumstances which clothe a particu-
lar kind of business with a "public interest," as to be sub-
ject to regulation, must be such as to create a peculiarly
close relation between the public and those engaged in it
and raise implications of an affirmative obligation on their
part to be reasonable in dealing with the public. One does
not devote his property or business to a public use, or
clothe it with a public interest, merely because he makes
commodities for and sells to the public in common callings
such as those of the butcher, baker, tailor, etc. Chas.
Wolff Packing Co. v. Court of Industrial Relations of State
of Kansas, 43 S.Ct. 630, 633, 262 U.S. 522, 67 L.Ed. 1103, 27
A.L.R. 1280. A business is not affected with a public in-
terest merely because it is large, or because the public
has concern in respect of its maintenance, or derives bene-
fit, accommodation, ease, or enjoyment from it. Tyson
& Bro.-United Theatre Ticket Offices v. Banton, 47 S.Ct.
426, 273 U.S. 418, 71 L.Ed. 718, 58 A.L.R. 1236.

lic purpose. Newhall v. Sanger, 92 U.S. 763, 23
L.Ed. 769; State v. Telegraph Co., 52 La.Ann.
1411, 27 So. 796. See Lands.
Public laundry. This term, in Labor Law, N. Y.
§ 296 (Consol. Laws, c. 31), includes a laundry
to the public, and is not limited to laundry doing
custom work only. Van Zandt's, Inc., v. Depart-
ment of Labor of State of New York, 129 Misc.
747, 222 N.Y.S. 450, 451.
Public lavatories. Such as are open to all who
may choose to use them. Irvine v. Common-
wealth, 124 Va. 817, 97 S.E. 769.
The term may, however, include a washroom in a lodg-
ing house for men guests only. City of Chicago v. Mc-
Guire, 185 Ill. App. 589, 590.
Public law. That branch or department of law
which is concerned with the state in its political
or sovereign capacity, including constitutional and
administrative law, and with the definition, regu-
lation, and enforcement of rights in cases where
the state is regarded as the subject of the right
or object of the duty,—including criminal law
and criminal procedure,—and the law of the state,
considered in its quasi private personality, e.,
as capable of holding or exercising rights, or ac-
quiring and dealing with property, in the charac-
ter of an individual. Holl. Jur. 106, 300. That
portion of law which is concerned with political
conditions; that is to say, with the powers, rights,
duties, capacities, and incapacities which are pe-
culiar to political superiors, supreme and subor-
dinate. Aust. Jur. In one sense, a designation
given to international law, as distinguished from
the laws of a particular nation or state. In an-
other sense, a law or statute that applies to the
people generally of the nation or state adopting
or enacting it, is denominated a public law, as
contradistinguished from a private law, affecting
only an individual or a small number of persons.
Morgan v. Cree, 46 Vt. 773, 14 Am.Rep. 640.
Public offense. An act or omission forbidden by
law, and punishable as by law provided. Ford
v. State, 7 Ind.App. 567, 35 N.E. 34.
Public passage. A right, subsisting in the pub-
lic, to pass over a body of water, whether the
land under it be public or owned by a private
person. This term is synonymous with public
highway, with this difference: by the latter is
understood a right to pass over the land of an-
other; by the former is meant the right of going
over the water which is on another's land. Carth.
193; Hamm. N. P. 195.
Public place. A place to which the general
public has a right to resort; not necessarily a
place devoted solely to the uses of the public,
but a place which is in point of fact public rath-
er than private, a place visited by many persons
and usually accessible to the neighboring public.
People v. Whitman, 178 App.Div. 193, 165 N.Y.S.
148, 149. Roach v. Eugene, 23 Or. 376, 31 P. 825.
Any place .so situated that what passes there can
be seen by any considerable number of persons,
if they happen to look. Steph. Cr. L. 115. Also,
a place in which the public has an interest as af-
fecting the safety, health, morals, and welfare
of the community. A place exposed to the public,
and where the public gather together or pass to
and fro. Lewis v. Commonwealth, 197 Ky. 449,
Public purpose. In the law of taxation, emi-
nent domain, etc., this is a term of classification
to distinguish the objects for which, according to
settled usage, the government is to provide, from
those which, by the like usage, are left to private
interest, inclination, or liberality. People v. Sal-
em Tp. Board, 20 Mich. 485, 4 Am.Rep. 400; Black,
Const. Law (3d Ed.) p. 454, et seq.; Hagler v.
Small, 307 Ill. 460, 138 N.E. 849, 854. The term
is synonymous with governmental purpose. State
v. Dixon, 66 Mont. 76, 213 P. 227, 231. As employ-
ed to denote the objects for which taxes may be
levied, it has no relation to the urgency of the
public need or to the extent of the public benefit
which is to follow; the essential requisite being
that a public service or use shall affect the in-
habitants as a community, and not merely as in-
dividuals. Stevenson v. Port of Portland, 82 Or.
576, 162 P. 509, 511. A public purpose or public
business has for its objective the promotion of the
public health, safety, morals, general welfare,
security, prosperity, and contentment of all the
inhabitants or residents within a given political
division, as, for example, a state, the sovereign
powers of which are exercised to promote such
public purpose or public business. Green v. Fra-
zier, 44 N.D. 395, 176 N.W. 11, 17. See, also, City
of Tombstone y. Macia, 30 Ariz. 218, 245 P. 677,
679, 46 A.L.R. 828.
Public service. A term applied in modern us-
age to the objects and enterprises of certain kinds
of corporations, which specially serve the needs
of the general public or conduce to the comfort
and convenience of an entire community, such as
railroad, gas, water, and electric light companies;
and companies furnishing motor vehicle trans-
portation. Harrison v. Big Four Bus Lines, 217
Ky. 119, 288 S.W. 1049. A public service or quasi
public corporation is one private in its ownership,
but which has an appropriate franchise from the
state to provide for a necessity or convenience of
the general public, incapable of being furnished
by private competitive business, and dependent
for its exercise on eminent domain or govern-
mental agency. Attorney General v. Haverhill
Gaslight Co., 215 Mass. 394, 101 N.E. 1061, 1063,
Ann.Cas.1914C, 1266. It is one of a large class
of private corporations which on account of spe-
cial franchises conferred on them owe a duty to
the public which they may be compelled to per-
form. State ex rel. Coco v. Riverside Irr. Co., 142
La. 10, 76 So. 216, 218.
Public service commission. A board or com-
mission created by the legislature to exercise pow-
er of supervision or regulation over public utili-
ties or public service corporations. Railroad Com-
mission of Alabama v. Northern Alabama Ry. Co.,
182 Ala. 357, 62 So. 749. Such a commission is
a legal, administrative body, provided for the ad-
ministration of certain matters within the police
power, with power to make regulations as to
certain matters when required for the public
safety and convenience, and to determine facts
on which existing laws shall operate. Bessette v.
Goddard, 87 Vt. 77, 88 A. 1, 3. People ex rel. New
Public Service Commission,
Second District, 141 N.Y.S. 1018, 1022, 157 App.
Div. 156.
Public, true, and notorious. The old form by
which charges in the allegations in the ecclesias-
tical courts were described at the end of each
particular.
Public use, in constitutional provisions restrict-
ing the exercise of the right to take private prop-
erty in virtue of eminent domain, means a use
concerning the whole community as distinguished
from particular individuals. But each and every
member of society need not be equally interested
in such use, or be personally and directly affect-
ed by it; if the object is to satisfy a great public
want or exigency, that is sufficient. Rindge Co. v.
Los Angeles County, 43 S.Ct. 689, 692, 262 U.S.
700, 67 L.Ed. 1186. The term may be said to mean
public usefulness, utility, or advantage, or what is
productive of general benefit. Williams v. City of
Norman, 85 Okl. 230, 205 P. 144, 148. But it is
not synonymous with public benefit. Ferguson
v. Illinois Cent. R. Co., 202 Iowa, 508, 210 N.W.
604, 606. It may be limited to the inhabitants of
a small or restricted locality, but must be in
common, and not for a particular individual. Po-
cantico Water Works Co. v. Bird, 130 N.Y. 249, 29
N.E. 246. The use must be a needful one for the

to serve the public and treat all persons alike,
without discrimination. Highland Dairy Farms

use of property or facilities owned or furnished
by them. Buder v. First Nat. Bank in St. Louis,
C.C.A.Mo., 16 F.2d 990, 992. To constitute a true
"public utility," the devotion to public use must
be of such character that the public generally, or
that part of it which has been served and which
has accepted the service, has the legal right to
demand that that service shall be conducted, so
long as it is continued, with reasonable efficiency
under reasonable charges. Richardson v. Rail-
road Commission of California, 191 Cal. 716, 218
P. 418, 420. The devotion to public use must be

is available to the public generally and indis-
criminately, or there must be the acceptance by
the utility of public franchises or calling to its
aid the police power of the state. Southern Ohio
Power Co. v. Public Utilities Commission of Ohio,

Railroad or Other Carriers
A line is a series of public .conveyances, as
coaches, steamers, packets and the like passing
to and fro between places with regularity. The
word is broad enough to include line of motor
freight trucks operating between fixed termini on
regular schedule and route. "Stage line," "rail-
road line" and "automobile line" are expressions
which are ordinarily understood to mean a regu-
lar line of vehicles for public use operating be-
tween distant points or between different cities.

of an individual or limited class. Shaver v. Star-
rett, 4 Ohio St. 499. It embraces the primary
social interests of safety, order, morals, economic

State v. Hutchinson Ice Cream Co., 168 Iowa, 1,
147 N.W. 195, 199, L.R.A.1917B, 198. In the de-
velopment of our civic life, the definition of "pub-
lic welfare" has also developed until it has been
held to bring within its purview regulations for

convenience. Pettis v. Alpha Alpha Chapter of

lic; to exhibit, display, disclose or reveal. Tif-
fany Productions v. Dewing, D.C.Md., 50 F.2d 911,

tice. Daly v. Beery, 45 N.D. 287, 178 N.W. 104,
As descriptive of the publishing of laws and ordinances,
it means printing or otherwise reproducing copies of them
and distributing them in such a manner as to make their
contents easily accessible to the public; it forms no part
of the enactment of the law. "Promulgation," on the
other hand, seems to denote the proclamation or announce-
ment of the edict or statute as a preliminary to its acquir-
ing the force and operation of law. But the two terms are
often used interchangeably. Chicago v. McCoy, 136 Ill.
344, 26 N.E. 363, 11 L.R.A. 413; For the distinction be-
tween them, see Toullier, Dr. Civ. Fr. titre Preliminaire,
n. 59.
In connection with the publication of rates, the term may

Co., 155 N.Y. 241, 49 N.E. 872, 41 L.R.A. 846, 63
Am.St.Rep. 666. As employed in the Copyright
Law, means a general publication rather than a
limited one. Copyright Act 1909, § 2, 17 U.S.C.A.
§ 2.
"Limited publication" is communication of a literary
composition to a select number upon condition, express
or implied, that it is not intended to be thereafter common
property. To constitute "publication," within Copyright
Law, there must be such a dissemination of the work of
art itself among the public as to justify the belief that it
took place with the intention of rendering such work com-
mon property. Copyright Law 1909, § 2, 17 U.S.C.A. a 2.
Berry v. Hoffman, 125 Pa.Super. 261, 189 A. 516.

reduction of libelous matter to writing and its de-
livery to any one other than the person injurious-
ly affected thereby.
The dictation to a stenographer of a libelous letter is
ordinarily a publication of the libel. Nelson v. Whitten.
D.C.N.Y., 272 F. 135, 139; But see Owen v. Pub. Co., 32
App.Div. 465, 53 N.Y.S. 1033. Every repetition of defama-
tory words is a new publication and constitutes a new
cause of action.

The formal declaration made by a testator at
the time of signing his will that it is his last will
and testament. 4 Kent, Comm. 515, and note.

ton v. Mitton, 12 N.J.Law, 70. The act or acts of
the testator by which he manifests that it is his
intention to give effect to the paper as his last
will and testament; any communication indicat-
ing to the witness that the testator intends to give

motion, or conduct. In re Spier's Estate, 99 Neb.

This term, as applied to a thing or right, means that it
Is open to or exercisable by all persons. It designates
things which are owned by "the public;" that is, the en-
tire state or community, and not by any private person.
When a thing is common property, so that any one can
make use of it who likes, it is said to be publici juris; as
in the case of light, air, and public water. Sweet.

332, 335.
This term "pueblo," in its original signification, means
"people" or "population," but is used in the sense of the
English word "town." It has the indefiniteness of that
term, and, like it, is sometimes applied to a mere collec-
tion of individuals residing at a particular place, a settle-
ment or village, as well as to a regularly organized munici-
pality. Trenouth v. San Francisco, 100 U.S. 251, 25 L.Ed.

procure' him to be imprisoned for one month or
