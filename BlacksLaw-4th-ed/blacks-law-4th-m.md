know the nature and quality of the act or did
know what he was doing but did not know that it
was wrong, he is not responsible. Hixon v. State,

less extensive signification according to the use
and connection in which it occurs. In its widest
sense it includes the whole body of public func-

rant for the arrest of a person charged with a public of-

granted by King John of England to the barons, at Runny-
mede, on June 15, 1215, and afterwards, with some altera-

I. This charter is justly regarded as the foundation of
English constitutional liberty. Among its thirty-eight

tration of justice, defining the temporal and ecclesiastical
jurisdictions, securing the personal liberty of the subject
and his rights of property, and the limits of taxation, and
for preserving the liberties and privileges of the church.

the Charta de Foresta, which was granted about the same
time, and partly by reason of its own transcendent impor-
tance.

Brinkop, 230 Mo.App. 871, 78 S.W.2d 538, 541. And in a

tional Bank of Westfield, 116 N.J.L. 122, 182 A. 613, 614.

Special malice. Particular or personal malice;
that is, hatred, ill will, or a vindictive disposition
against a particular individual. j
Universal malice. By this term is not meant a

## MALICE AFORETHOUGHT

A predetermination
to commit an act without legal justification or ex-
cuse. Harrison v. Commonwealth, 279 Ky. 510, 131
S.W.2d 454, 455. A malicious design to injure.
State v. Thomas, 157 Kan. 526, 142 P.2d 692, 693.
In the definition of "murder," malice aforethought exists
where the person doing the act which causes death has an
intention to cause death or grievous bodily harm to any l
person, (whether the person is actually killed or not) or
to commit any felony whatever, or has the knowledge that
the act will probably cause the death of or grievous bodily
harm to some person, although he does not desire it, or
even wishes that it may. not be caused. Steph.Crim.Dig.
144; 1 Russ.Crimes. 641. The words "malice afore-
thought" long ago acquired in law a settled meaning,
somewhat different from the popular one. In their legal
sense they do not import an actual intention to kill the
deceased. The idea is not spite or malevolence to the de-
ceased in particular, but evil design in general, the dictate
of a wicked, depraved, and malignant heart ; not premedi-
tated personal hatred or revenge towards the person killed,
but that kind of unlawful purpose which, if persevered in, l
must produce mischief. State v. Pike, 49 N.H. 399, 6 Am.
Rep. 533.

384, Hotchkiss v. Porter, 30 Conn. 414.
It implies desire or intent to injure, while "malice in
law," or "implied malice," means wrongful act done in-
tentionally, without just cause or excuse, and jury may in-
fer it as a deduction from want of probable cause. Glie-
berman v. Fine, 248 Mich. 8, 226 N.W. 669, 670.

Bacon v. Railroad Co., 66 Mich. 166, 33 N.W. 181.

r hatred. In a legal sense, any act done willfully and
urposely to the prejudice and injury of another, which is

## MANCIPATIO

Lat. In Roman law, a certain
ceremony or formal process anciently required to
be performed, to perfect the sale or conveyance
of res mancipi, (land, houses, slaves, horses, or
cattle.)
The parties were present, (vendor and vendee,) with five
witnesses and a person called "libripens," who held a bal-
ance or scales. A set form of words was repeated on
either side, indicative of transfer of ownership, and certain
prescribed gestures made, and the vendee then struck the
scales with a piece of copper, thereby symbolizing the pay-
ment, or weighing out, of the stipulated price.
The ceremony of mancipatio was used, in later times,
in one of the forms of making a will. The testator acted
as vendor, and the heir (or familice emptor) as purchaser,
the latter symbolically buying the whole estate or succes-
sion, of the former. The ceremony was also used by a
father in making a fictitious sale of his son, which sale,
when three times repeated, effectuated the ' emancipation
of the son.

## MANCIPI RES

Lat. In Roman law, certain
classes of things which could not be aliened or
transferred except by means of a certain formal
ceremony of conveyance called "mancipatio" (q.
v.) . These included land, houses, slaves, horses,
and cattle. All other things were called "res nec
mancipi."
The distinction was abolished by Justinian. The distinc-
tion corresponded as nearly as may be to the early distinc-
tion of English law into real and personal property ; res
mancipi being objects of a military or agricultural char-
acter, and res nec mancipi being all other subjects of
property. Like personal estate, res nec mancipi were not
originally either valuable in se or valued. Brown.

## MANCIPIUM

Lat. In Roman law, the momen-
tary condition in which a filius, etc., might be when
in course of emancipation from the potestas, and
before that emancipation was absolutely com-
plete. The condition was not like the dominica
potestas over slaves, but slaves are frequently
called "mancipia" in the non-legal Roman authors.
Brown.
To form a clear conception of the true import of the
word in the Roman jurisprudence, it is necessary to advert
to the four distinct powers which were exercised by the
pater familias, viz.; the manus, or martial power; the
mancipium, resulting from the mancipatio, or alienatio per
vs et libram, of a freeman; the dominica potestas, the
tas, the paternal power. When the pater familias sold his
son, venum dare, mancipare, the paternal power was suc-
ceeded by the mancipium, or the power acquired by the
purchaser over the person whom he held in mancipio, and
whose condition was assimilated to that of a slave. What
is most remarkable is, that on the emancipation from the
mancipium he fell back into the paternal power, which was
not entirely exhausted until he had been sold three times
by the pater familias. Si pater filium ter venum dat, filius
a patre liber esto. Gaius speaks of the mancipatio as imag-
inaria qucedam venditio, because in his times it was only
resorted to for the purpose of adoption or emancipation.
See 1 Ortolan 112; Morey, Rom. L. 23, 32; Sohm, Inst. R. L.
124, 390.

## MANCIPLE

especially in colleges. Cowell.

## MANCOMUNAL

In Spanish law, an obligation
is said to be mancomunal when one person as-
sumes the contract or debt of another, and makes
himself liable to pay or fulfill it. Schm.Civil Law,
MANCUS. See Manca.

## MANDAMIENTO

In Spanish law, commission;
authority or power of attorney. A contract of
good faith, by which one person commits to the
gratuitous charge of another his affairs, and the
latter accepts the charge. White, New Recop. b.
2, tit. 12, c. 1.

## MANDAMUS

Lat. We command. This is the
name of a writ (formerly a high prerogative writ)
which issues from a court of superior jurisdiction,
and is directed to a private or municipal corpora-
tion, or any of its officers, or to an executive, ad-
ministrative or judicial officer, or to an inferior
court, commanding the performance of a particu-
lar act therein specified, and belonging to his or
their public, official, or ministerial duty, or direct-
ing the restoration of the complainant to rights
or privileges of which he has been illegally de-
prived. Lahiff v. St. Joseph, etc., Soc., 76 Conn.
648, 57 A. 692, 65 L.R.A. 92, 100 Am.St.Rep. 1012.
The action of mandamus is one, brought in a court of
competent jurisdiction, to obtain an order of such court
commanding an inferior tribunal, board, corporation, or
person to do or not to do an act the performance or omis-
sion of which the law enjoins as a duty resulting from an
office, trust, or station. Where discretion is left to the
inferior tribunal or person, the mandamus, can only com-
pel it to act, but cannot control such discretion. Rev.Code
Iowa, 1880, § 3373 (Code 1931, § 12440).
Writ of "mandamus" is summary writ issued from court
of competent jurisdiction to command performance of spe-
cific duty which relator is entitled to have performed. Peo-
ple v. Nelson, 346 Ill. 247, 178 N.E. 485, 487.
It is legal, not equitable, remedy, and, when issued, is
an inflexible peremptory command to do a particular thing.
State ex rel. Onion v. Supreme Temple Pythian Sisters,
227 Mo.App. 557, 54 S.W.2d 468, 469.
The writ of mandamus is either peremptory or alterna-
tive, according as it requires the defendant absolutely to
obey its behest, or gives him an opportunity to show cause
to the contrary. It is the usual practice to issue the alter-
native writ first. This commands the defendant to do the
particular act, or else to appear and show cause against it
at a day named. If he neglects to obey the writ, and
either makes default in his appearance or fails to show
good cause against the application, the peremptory man-
damus issues, which commands him absolutely and without
qualification to do the act.

## MANDANS

Lat. In the civil law, the employ-
ing party in a contract of mandate. One who gives
requests, or employs another to do some act for
him. Inst. 3, 27, 1, et seq.

strict interpretation, but unlawful commands a
broad and extended one. Bac.Max. reg. 16.

Horton v. State, 63 Neb. 34, 88 N.W. 146.
A precept or order issued upon the decision of
an appeal or writ of error, directing action to be
taken, or disposition to be made of case, by in-
ferior court. Egbert v. St. Louis & S. F. R. Co.,
50 Okl. 623, 151 P. 228, 230.
In some of the state jurisdictions, the name
"mandate" has been substituted for "mandamus"
as the formal title of that writ. Chrisman v. Su-
perior Court in and for Fresno County, 63 Cal.
App. 477, 219 P. 85, 86; Davies v. Board of Com'rs
of Nez Perce County, 26 Idaho, 450, 143 P. 945, 946.
A bailment of property in regard to which the
bailee engages to do some act without reward.
Story, Bailm. § 137; Maddock v. Riggs, 106 Kan.
808, 190 P. 12, 16, 12 A.L.R. 216.
Mandates and deposits closely resemble each other; the
distinction being that in mandates the care and service are
the principal, and the custody the accessory, while in
deposits the custody is the principal thing, and the care
and service are merely accessory. Story, Bailm. § 140.
A contract by which a lawful business is com-
mitted to the management of another, and by him
undertaken to be performed gratuitously. The
mandatary is bound to the exercise of slight dili-
gence, and is responsible for gross neglect. Rich-
ardson v. Futrell, 42 Miss. 525; Williams v. Con-
ger, 8 S.Ct. 933, 125 U.S. 397, 31 L.Ed. 778. A
mandate, procuration, or letter of attorney is an
act by which one person gives power to another
to transact for him and in his name one or several
affairs.
for the interest of the person granting it only; for the
joint interest of both parties; for the interest of a third
person; for the interest of a third person and that of the
party granting it; and, finally, for the interest of the man-
datary and a third person. Civ.Code La. arts. 2985, 2986.
The word may also denote a request or direction.
Thus, a check is a mandate by the drawer to his
banker to pay the amount to the transferee or
holder of the check. 1 Q.B.Div. 33.
Civil Law. The instructions which the emper-
or addressed to a public functionary, and which

provinces and there they had the authority of
the principal edicts. Say.Dr.Rom. c. 3, § 24, no. 4.

MANDATORY, adj. Containing a command; pre-
ceptive; imperative; peremptory.
A "mandatory" provision in the statute is one the omis-
sion to follow which renders the proceedings to which it
relates void, while a "directory" provision is one the
observance of which is not necessary to validity of the pro-
ceeding. Siedschlag v. May, 363 Ill. 538, 2 N.E.2d 836, 838.
So the mandatory part of a writ is that which commands
the person to do the act specified. State v. Barnell, 109
Ohio St. 246, 142 N.E. 611, 613; Williams v. Sherwood, 51
N.D. 520, 200 N.W. 782, 784.
It is also said that when the provision of a statute is the
essence of the thing required to be done, it is mandatory,
Kavanaugh v. Fash, C.C.A.Okl., 74 F.2d 435, 437; other-
wise, when it relates to form and manner; and where an
act is incident, or after jurisdiction acquired, it is direc-
tory merely, Davis v. Smith, 58 N.H. 17.
"Mandatory" s' atutory provision is one which must be
observed, as distinguished from "directory" provision,
which leaves it optional with department or officer to
which addressed to obey it or not. State ex rel. Dworken
v. Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County, 131 Ohio
St. 23, 1 N.E.2d 138, 139.

## MANDATORY

given; one who undertakes without compensation

## MANOR

A house, dwelling, seat, or residence.
In English law, the manor was originally a tract of land
granted out by the king to a lord or other great person, in
fee. It was otherwise called a "barony" or "lordship,"
and appendant to it was the right to hold a court, called
the "court-baron." The lands comprised in the manor
were divided into terrce tenementales (tenemental lands or
bocland) and terrce dominicales, or demesne lands. The
former were given by the lord of the manor to his follow-
ers or retainers in freehold. The latter were such as he
reserved for his own use; but of these part were held by
tenants in copyhold, e., those holding by a copy of the
record in the lord's court; and part, under the name of
the "lord's waste," served for public roads and commons
of pasture for the lord and tenants. The tenants, consid-
ered in their relation to the court-baron and to each other,
were called "pares curiae." The word also signified the
franchise of having a manor, with jurisdiction for a court-
baron and the right to the rents and services of copyhold-
ers.
In American law, a manor is a tract held of a proprietor
by a fee-farm rent in money or in kind, and descending to
the oldest son of the proprietor, who in New York is called
a "patroon." People v. Van Rensselaer, 9 N.Y. 291.
Reputed Manor. Whenever the demesne lands
and the services become absolutely separated,
the manor ceases to be a manor in reality, al-
though it may (and usually does) continue to be
a manor in reputation, and is then called a "re-
puted manor," and it is also sometimes called a
"seigniory in gross." Brown.

## MANORIAL EXTENT

A survey of a manor
made by a jury of tenants, often of unfree men
sworn to sit for the particulars of each tenancy,
and containing the smallest details as to the na-
ture of the service due. These manorial extents
"were made in the interest of the lords, who were
anxious that all due services should be done; but
they imply that other and greater services are not
due, that the customary tenants, even though
they be unfree men, owe these ser ices for their
tenements, no less and no more. Statements that
the tenants are not bound to do services of a par-
ticular kind are not very uncommon"; 1 Poll. &
Maitl. 343. The "extents" of manors are descrip-
tions which give the numbers and names of the
tenants, the size of their holdings, the legal kind
of their tenure and the kind and amount of their
service; Maitland, Material for Hist. E. L. in 2
Sel.Essays in Anglo-Amer. Leg. Hist. 87.

## MANQUELLER

## MANSLAUGHTER

The unlawful killing of an-
other without malice, either express or implied;
which may be either voluntarily, upon a sudden
heat, or involuntarily, but in the commission of
some unlawful act. 1 Hale, P.C. 466; 4 Bl.Comm.
The unlawful killing of a human creature with-
out any deliberation, which may be involuntary,
in the commission of a lawful act without due cau-
tion and circumspection. Wallace v. U. S., 16 S.
Ct. 859, 162 U.S. 466, 40 L.Ed. 1039; High v. State,
10 S.W. 238, 26 Tex.App. 545, 8 Am.St.Rep. 488;
U. S. v. Lewis, C.C.Tex., 111 F. 632.
The distinction between "manslaughter" and "murder"
consists in the following: In the former, though the act
which occasions the death be unlawful or likely to be
attended with bodily mischief, yet the malice, either ex-
press or implied, which is the very essence of murder, is
presumed to be wanting in manslaughter. 1 East, P.C.
218; Comm. v. Webster, 5 Cush., Mass., 304, 52 Am.Dec.
711. No time for premeditation. 1 Hale, P.C. 437; 1 Russ.
Crimes, 485; 1 Bish.Crim.Law, 678; People v. Crenshaw,
298 Ill. 412, 131 N.E. 576, 577, 15 A.L.R. 671.
There are various degrees of manslaughter recognized by
different states, viz. : First degree : Roohano v. State, 167
Wis. 500, 167 N.W. 741, 742. Second degree : State v.
Staples, 126 Minn. 396, 148 N.W. 283. Third degree: State
v. Prince, 258 Mo. 315, 167 S.W. 535, 538. Fourth degree :
State v. Schwenk, 101 Kan. 408, 167 P. 743, 744.
Voluntary manslaughter. Manslaughter com-
mitted voluntarily upon a sudden heat of the pas-
sions; as if, upon a sudden quarrel, two persons
fight, and one of them kills the other. 4 Bl.Comm.
190, 191; State v. Disalvo, 121 A. 661, 663, 2 W.W.
Harr. (Del.) 232; Wiley v. State 19 Ariz. 346, 170
r
P. 869, 873, L.R.A.1918D, 373. It is the unlawful
taking of human life under circumstances fall-
ing short of willful or deliberate intent to kill and
approaching too near thereto to be justifiable hom-
icide. State v. McVay, 47 R.I. 292, 132 A. 436,
438, 44 A.L.R. 572.
Involuntary manslaughter. It exists where a
person in committing an unlawful act not feloni-
ous or tending to great bodily harm, or in com-
mitting a lawful act without proper caution or
requisite skill, unguardedly or undesignedly kills
another. State v. Disalvo, 2 W.W.Harr. (Del.) 232,
121 A. 661, 663; State v. McVay, 47 R.I. 292, 132
A. 436, 437, 44 A.L.R. 572.
The absence of intention to kill or to commit any unlaw-
ful act which might reasonably produce death or great
bodily harm is the distinguishing feature between volun-
tary and involuntary homicide. State v. Weisengoff, 85
W.Va. 271, 101 S.E. 450, 455; State v. Pond, 125 Me. 453,
134 A. 572, 573.

Meaning of word "manufacture," which is defined as the
making of goods or wares by manual labor or by machin-

ficial products of human industry, nearly all such materials

It attaches to the vessel and freight, and is to be en-

The word "lien" is used in maritime law not in the
strict legal sense in which we understand it in courts of
common law, in which case there could be no lien where
there was no possession, actual or constructive, but to
express, as if by analogy, the nature of claims which nei-
ther presuppose nor originate in possession. 22 Eng.Law &
Eq. 62. A distinction is sometimes made, however, be-
tween qualified maritime liens, which depend upon pos-

nor depend upon possession. Cutler v. Rae, 7 How. 729, 12
L.Ed. 890; 21 Am.Law Reg. 1. A "maritime lien" is a

paid out of proceeds. The Poznan, C.C.A.N.Y., 9 F.2d 838,
842. Such a lien is a proprietary interest or right of prop-
erty in the vessel itself, and not a cause of action or
demand for personal judgment against the owner. The

Queen, D.C.Va., 8 F.2d 426, 427.

or vis major, the lender shall not be repaid unless
what remains shall be equal to the sum borrowed;
and if the thing arrive in safety, or in case it
shall not have been injured but by its own defects
or the fault of the master or mariners, the bor-
rower shall be bound to return the sum borrowed,
together with a certain sum agreed upon as the
price of the hazard incurred. Emerig. Mar. Loans,

## MARK

A character, usually in the form of a
cross, made as a substitute for his signature by
a person who cannot write, in executing a con-
veyance or other legal document.
It is commonly made as follows : A third person writes
the name of the marksman, leaving a blank space between
the Christian name and surname; in this space the latter
traces the mark, or crossed lines, and above the mark is
written "his," (or "her,") and below it, "mark."
The sign, writing, or ticket put upon manufac-
tured goods to distinguish them from others, ap-
pearing thus in the compound, "trade-mark."
A token, evidence, or proof; as in the phrase "a
mark of fraud."
A weight used in several parts of Europe, and
for several commodities, especially gold and silver.
When gold and silver are sold by the mark, it is
divided into twenty-four carats.
A money of accounts in England, and in some
other countries a coin. The English mark is two-
thirds of a pound sterling, or 13s. 4d.; and the
Scotch mark is of equal value in Scotch money of
account. Enc.Amer.
The word is sometimes used as another form
of "marque," a license of reprisals.
In early Teutonic and English law, a species of
village community, being the lowest unit in the
political system; one of the forms of the gens or
clan, variously known as the "mark," "gemeinde,"
"commune," or "parish." Also the land held in
common by such a community. The union of sev-
eral such village communities and their marks, or
common lands, forms the next higher political
union, the hundred. Freem. Compar. Politics, 116,
Demi-mark. Half a mark; a sum of money
which was anciently required to be tendered in a
writ of right, the effect of such tender being to put
the demandant, in the first instance, upon proof
of the seisin as stated in his count; that is, to
prove that the seisin was in the king's reign there
stated. Rosc. Real Act. 216.

ket-place on one side only, or during one part of
the day only, the other sides being occupied by
temples, theaters, courts of justice, and other pub-
lic buildings. Wharton.
The liberty, privilege, or franchise by which

posed publicly to sale is market overt, for such
things only as the owner professes to trade in. 2

in the usual and ordinary course of trade and com-
petition, between sellers and buyers equally free to
bargain, as established by records of late sales.

command in the market. State Highway Board
v. Bridges, 60 Ga.App. 240, 3 S.E.2d 907, 910.
For "Fair and Reasonable Market Value" and
"Fair Cash Market Value", see those titles.
The market value of an article or piece of property is the
price which it might be expected to bring if offered for sale
in a fair market; not the price which might be obtained
on a sale at public auction or a sale forced by the necessi-
ties of the owner, but such a price as would be fixed by
negotiation and mutual agreement, after ample time to
find a purchaser, as between a vendor who is willing (but
not compelled) to sell and a purchaser who desires to buy
but is not compelled to take the particular article or piece
of property. Winnipiseogee Lake, etc., Co. v. Gilford, 67
N.H. 514, 35 A. 945; Muser v. Magone, 155 U.S. 240, 15

tors' Service Co., 73 Cal.App. 467, 238 P. 825, 827.

## MARKETABLE TITLE

A "marketable title" to
land is such a title as a court of' equity, when asked
to decree specific performance of the contract of
sale, will compel the vendee to accept as sufficient.
It is said to be not merely a defensible title, but
a title which is free from plausible or reasonable
objections. Austin v. Barnum, 52 Minn. 136, 53
N.W. 1132; Brokaw v. Duffy, 165 N.Y. 391, 59 N.E.
196; Wilson v. Korte, 91 Wash. 30, 157 P. 47, 48.
Such a title as is free from reasonable doubt in
law and in fact; not merely a title valid in fact,
but one which readily can be sold or mortgaged to
a reasonably prudent purchaser or mortgagee; one
acceptable to a reasonable purchaser, informed as
to the facts and their legal meaning, willing tc-:,
perform his contract, in the exercise of that pru-
dence which business men usually bring to bear on
such transactions; one under which a purchaser
may have quiet and peaceful enjoyment of the
property; one that is free from material defects,
or grave doubts, and reasonably free from litiga-
tion. Myrick v. Austin, 141 Kan. 778, 44 P.2d 266,
MARKSMAN. In practice and conveyancing. One
who makes his mark; a person who cannot write,
and only makes his mark in executing instruments.

## MARKUSH DOCTRINE

The Noctrine permits an
applicant for a patent where there is no known
subgeneric term which would include elements
which applicant found useful and exclude those
which are not, to employ a generic term limited to
the elements found to be operative and recognizes
as unobjectionable as to form, claims containing
a coined subgeneric expression. In re Swenson,
C.C.P.A., 132 F.2d 336.

## MARLBRIDGE, STATUTE OF

An English stat-
ute enacted in 1267 (52 Hen. III.) at Marlbridge,
(now called "Marlborough,") where parliament
was then sitting. It related to land tenures, and
to procedure, and to unlawful and excessive dis-
tresses.
MARQUE AND REPRISAL, LETTERS OF.
These words, "marque" and "reprisal," are fre-
quently used as synonymous, but, taken in their
strict etymological sense, the latter signifies a
"taking in return;" the former, the passing the
frontiers (marches) in order to such taking. Let-
ters of marque and reprisal are grantable, by the
law of nations, whenever the subjects of one state
are oppressed and injured by those of another, and
justice is denied by that state to which the oppres-
sor belongs; and the party to whom these letters
are granted may then seize the bodies or the goods
of the subjects of the state to which the offender
belongs, until satisfaction be made, wherever they
happen to be found. Reprisals are to be granted
only in case of a clear and open denial of justice.
At the present day, in consequence partly of trea-
ties and partly of the practice of nations, the
making of reprisals is confined to the seizure of
commercial property on the high seas by public
cruisers, or by private cruisers specially authorized
thereto. Brown.

## MARQUE, LAW OF

A sort of law of reprisal,
which entitles him who has received any wrong
from another and cannot get ordinary justice to
take the shipping or goods of the wrong-doer,
where he can find them within his own bounds or
precincts, in satisfaction of the wrong. Cowell;
Brown.
MARQUIS, or MARQUESS. In English law, one
of the second order of nobility; next in order to a
duke.

## MARQUISATE

The seigniory of a marquis.

## MARRIAGE

Marriage, as distinguished from
the agreement to marry and from the act of be-
coming married, is the civil status, condition, or
relation of one man and one woman united in law
for life, for the discharge to each other and the
community of the duties legally incumbent on
those whose association is founded on the distinc-
tion of sex. 1 Bish.Mar. & Div. § 3; Collins v.
Hoag & Rollins, 121 Neb. 716, 238 N.W. 351, 355;
Allen v. Allen, 73 Conn. 54, 46 A. 242, 49 L.R.A.
A contract, according to the form prescribed by
law, by which a man and woman, capable of en-
tering into such contract, mutually engage with
each other to live their whole lives together in the
state of union which ought to exist between a hus-
band and wife. Shelf. Mar. & Div. 1; Seuss v.
Schukat, 358 III. 27, 192 N.E. 668, 671, 95 A.L.R.
The word also signifies the act, ceremony, or
formal proceeding by which persons take each
other for husband and wife. Davis v. Davis, 119
Conn. 194, 175 A. 574, 575.
In old English law, marriage is used in the sense
of "maritagium," (q. v.,) or the feudal right en-
joyed by the lord or guardian in chivalry of dis-
posing of his ward in marriage.
Avail of marriage. See that title.
Consensual marriage. See that title.
Common-law marriage. See Common Law.
Fleet marriages. There were in the neighbor-
hood of the Fleet prison about sixty marriage
houses, some of which were public houses and oth-
ers not. They were known by having a sign-board,
with joined hands, in addition to the public house
sign. At the doors of these houses persons called
Pliers solicited the passers-by to come in and be
married, and in these houses persons who were,
or pretended to be, clergymen performed the mar-
riage ceremony and made entries in registers
that were kept at the respective houses. There is
little doubt that many entries had false dates, that
persons who were married personated others, and
that women who wished to plead a plea of cover-
ture or hide their shame were married to men who,
for a trifling gratuity, married any woman who
would pay them, though they had previously mar-
ried others. Such marriages also took place in
the neighborhood of the King's Bench prison, at
the Savoy, in the Mint, in the Borough, and at the
Mayfair Chapel.
It is said in 1 Peake N.P.C. 303, that a marriage in the
Fleet was considered at that time good and legal. In 13
Carr. & P. 581 (34 E.C.L.R.), Patteson, J., said: "I shall
not receive the Fleet Registry in evidence for any purpose
whatever." They were refused in 1 Peake N.P.C. 303. A
collection of over a thousand Fleet registers have been
deposited in the Registry, of the Bishop of London.
See Extracts from these registers and a historical note
In 34 E.C.L.R. 534; Burns, Fleet Registers,
Jactitation of marriage. See Jactitation.
Manus marriage. A form of marriage in early
Rome; it formed a relation called manus (hand)
and brought the wife into the husband's power,
placing her as to legal rights in the position of
a daughter. Bryce, Marr. & Divorce, in 3 Sel.
Essays in Anglo-Amer.L.H. 787.
Mixed marriage. A marriage between persons
of different nationalities; or, more particularly, be-
tween persons of different racial origin; as be-
tween a white person and a negro or an Indian.
Morganatic marriage. The lawful and insep-
arable conjunction of a man, of noble or Illustri-
ous birth, with a woman of inferior station, upon
condition that neither the wife nor her children
shall partake of the titles, arms, or dignity of the
husband, or succeed to his inheritance, but be con-
tented with a certain allowed rank assigned to
them by the morganatic contract. But since these
restrictions relate only to the rank of the parties
and succession to property, without affecting the
nature of a matrimonial engagement, it must be
considered as a just marriage. The marriage cer-
emony was regularly performed; the union was
indissoluble; the children legitimate. Wharton.
Plural marriage. In general, any bigamous or
polygamous union, but particularly, a second or
subsequent marriage of a man who already has
one wife living under system of polygamy. See
Freil v. Wood, 1 Utah 165.
Scotch marriage. A marriage contracted with-
out any formal solemnization or religious cere-
mony, by the mere mutual agreement of the par-
ties per verba de prcesenti in the presence of wit-
nesses, recognized as valid by the Scottish law.

## MARRIAGE ACT, ROYAL

Spencer, 84 Misc.Rep. 264, 147 N.Y.S. 111, 113.

## MARRIAGE CONSIDERATION

The considera-
tion furnished by an intended marriage of two
persons. It is the highest consideration known to
the law.

## MARRIAGE LICENSE

A license or permission
granted by public authority to persons who intend
to intermarry, usually addressed to the minister
or magistrate who is to perform the ceremony, or,
in general terms, to any one authorized to solemn-
ize marriages. By statute in some jurisdictions,
it is made an essential prerequisite to the lawful
solemnization of the marriage.
MARRIAGE—NOTICE BOOK. A book kept, in
England, by the registrar, in which applications
for and issue of registrar's licenses to marry are

J.L. 296.

## MARRIAGE SETTLEMENT

A written agree-
ment in the nature of a conveyance, called a "set-
tlement," which is made in contemplation of a
proposed marriage and in consideration thereof,
either by the parties about to intermarry, or one
of them, or by a parent or relation on their behalf,
by which the title to certain property is settled,
i. e., fixed or limited to a prescribed course of suc-
cession; the object being, usually, to provide for
the wife and children. Thus, the estate might be
limited to the husband and issue, or to the wife
and issue, or to husband and wife for their joint
lives, remainder to the survivor for life, remainder
over to the issue, or otherwise. Such settlements
may also be made after marriage, in which case
they are called "postnuptial."
MARRIED WOMAN. A woman who has a hus-
band living and not divorced; a feme covert.

## MARSHAL

In old English law, the title borne
by several officers of state and of the law, of whom
the most important were the following: (1) The
earl-marshal, who presided in the court of chival-
ry; (2) the marshal of the king's house, or knight-
marshal, whose special authority was in the king's
palace, to hear causes between members of the
household, and punish faults committed within
the verge; (3) the marshal of the king's bench
prison, who had the custody of that jail; (4) the
marshal of the exchequer, who had the custody
of the king's debtors; (5) the marshal of the
judge of assize, whose duty was to swear in the
grand jury.
In American law, an officer pertaining to the or-
ganization of the federal judicial system, whose
duties are similar to those of a sheriff. He is to
execute the process of the United States courts
within the district for which he is appointed, etc.
Also, in some of the states, this is the name of
an officer of police, in a city or borough, having
powers and duties corresponding generally to
those of a constable or sheriff.

## MARSHAL OF THE QUEEN'S BENCH

An of-
ficer who had the custody of the queen's bench
prison. The St. 5 & 6 Vict. c. 22, abolished this
office, and substituted an officer called "keeper of
the queen's prison."
MARSHALING. Arranging, ranking, or dispos-
ing in order; particularly, in the case of a group
or series -of conflicting claims or interests, arrang-
ing them in such an order of sequence, or so di-
recting the manner of their satisfaction, as shall
secure justice to all persons concerned and the
largest possible measure of satisfaction to each.
See sub-titles infra.

## MARSHALING ASSETS

In equity, the arrang-
ing or ranking of assets in the due order of admin-
istration. Such an arrangement of the different
funds under administration as shall enable all the
parties having equities therein to receive their due
proportions, notwithstanding any intervening in-
terests, liens, or other claims of particular persons
to prior satisfaction out of a portion of these
funds. In re Van Zandt's Estate, 142 Misc. 663, 255
N.Y.S. 359, 366. The arrangement or ranking' of
assets in a certain order towards the payment of
debts. 1 Story, Eq.Jur. § 558; 4 Kent, Comm.
421. The arrangement of assets or claims so as to
secure the proper application of the assets to the
various claims; especially when there are two
classes of assets, and some creditors can enforce
their claims against both, and others against only
one, and the creditors of the former class are com-
pelled to exhaust the assets against which they
alone have a claim before having recourse to other
assets, thus providing for the settlement of as
many claims as possible. Pub.St.Mass. p. 1292.

## MARSHALING LIENS

The ranking or ordering
of several estates or parcels of land, for the satis-
faction of a judgment or mortgage to which they
are all liable, though successively conveyed away
by the debtor. The rule is that, where lands sub-
ject to the lien of a judgment or mortgage have
been sold or incumbered by the owner at different
times to different purchasers, the various tracts
are liable to the satisfaction of the lien in the in-
verse order of their alienation or incumbrance, the
land last sold being first chargeable. 1 Black,
Judgm. § 440.

## MARSHALING REMEDIES

The basis for
"marshaling of remedies" is that where one cred-
itor has security on two funds of common debtor
and another creditor has security on only one of
such funds, second creditor has right in equity to
compel first creditor to resort to the other fund, if
it is necessary for satisfaction of both creditors
and will not prejudice rights or interests of party
entitled to double fund, do injustice to debtor, or
operate inequitably on other persons' interests.
Greenwich Trust Co. v. Tyson, 129 Conn. 211, 27
A.2d 166, 174.

## MARSHALING SECURITIES

An equitable
practice, which consists in so ranking or arrang-
ing classes of creditors, with respect to the assets
of the common debtor, as to provide for satisfac-
tion of the greatest number of claims. The proc-
ess is this: Where one class of creditors have liens
or securities on two funds, while another class of
creditors can resort to only one of those funds,
equity will compel the doubly-secured creditors to
first exhaust that fund which will leave the single
security of the other creditors intact. See 1 Story,
Eq.Jur. § 633; Dilworth v. Federal Reserve Bank
of St. Louis, 170 Miss. 373, 154 So. 535, 540, 92 A.
L.R. 1076.

## MARSHALSEA

In English law, a prison belong-
ing to the king's bench. It has now been consoli-
dated with others, under the name of the "King's
Prison."

## MARSHALSEA, COURT OF

In English law, the
court or seat of the marshal. A court originally
held before the steward and marshal of the king's
house, instituted to administer justice between the
king's domestic servants. It had jurisdiction of
all trespasses committed within the verge of the
king's court, where one of the parties was of the
royal household; and of all debts and contracts,
when both parties were of that establishment.
It was abolished by 12 & 13 Vict. c. 101, § 13. Moz-
ley & Whitley.

## MART

A place of public traffic or sale.

## MARTE SUO DECURRERE

Lat. To run by its
own force. A term applied in the civil law to a
suit when it ran its course to the end without any
impediment. Calvin.

## MARTIAL LAW

Exists when military authori-
ties carry on government or exercise various de-
grees of control over civilians or civilian author-
ities in domestic territory. Ochikubo v. Bonesteel,
D.C.Cal., 60 F.Supp. 916, 928, 929, 930. A system
of law, obtaining only in time of actual war and
growing out of the exigencies thereof, arbitrary in
its character, and depending only on the will of
the commander of an army, which is established
and administered in a place or district of hostile
territory held in belligerent possession, or, some-
times, in places occupied or pervaded by insur-
gents or mobs, and which suspends all existing
civil laws, as well as the civil authority and the or-
dinary administration of justice. In re Ezeta, D.
C.Cal., 62 F. 972; Corn. v. Shortall, 206 Pa. 165, 55
A. 952, 65 L.R.A. 193. See, also, Military Law.
"Martial law, which is built upon no settled principles,
but is entirely arbitrary in its decisions, is in truth and
reality no law, but something indulged rather than al-
lowed as a law. The necessity of order and discipline in
an army is the only thing which can give it countenance,
and therefore it ought not to be permitted in time of
peace, when the king's courts are open for all persons to
receive justice according to the laws of the land." 1 Bl.
Comm. 413.
Martial law is neither more nor less than the will of the
general who commands the army. It overrides and sup-
presses all existing civil laws, civil officers, and civil
authorities, by the arbitrary exercise of military power;
and every citizen or subject—in other words, the entire
population of the country, within the confines of its pow-
er—is subjected to the mere will or caprice of the com-
mander. He holds the lives, liberty, and property of all
in the palm of his hand. Martial law is regulated by no
known or established system or code of laws, as it is over
and above all of them. The commander is the legislator,
judge, and executioner. In re Egan, 5 Blatchf. 321, F.Cas.
No.4,303.

## MAXIM

"Maxims" are but attempted general
statements of rules of law and are law only to ex-

2d 929, 936. An established principle or proposi-
tion. A principle of law universally admitted, as
_being a correct statement of the law, or as agree-
able to reason.
Coke defines a maxim to be "conclusion of rea-
son," and says that it is so called "quia maxima
ejus dignitas et certissima auctoritas, et quod
maxime omnibus probetur." Co.Litt. 11a. He
says in another place: "A maxime is a proposi-
tion to be of all men confessed and granted with-
out proofe, argument, or discourse." Id. 67a.

N.W. 349, 352, L.R.A.1918F, 164. Regardless of
the instrument, however, whether constitution,
statute, deed, contract or whatnot, courts not in-
frequently construe "may" as "shall" or "must"
to the end that justice may not be the slave of
grammar. Minor v. Mechanics' Bank, 1 Pet. 46,
64, 7 L.Ed. 47; Appeal of Burnap, 94 Conn. 286, 108

## MEANDER

To meander means to follow a wind-
ing or flexuous course; and when it is said, in a
description of land, "thence with the meander of
the river," it must mean a meandered line,—a
line which follows the sinuosities of the river,—
or, in other words, that the river is the boundary
between the points indicated. Turner v. Parker,
14 Or. 341, 12 P. 495; Schurmeier v. St. Paul &
P. R. Co., 10 Minn. 100, Gil. 75, 88 Am.Dec. 59.
This term is used in some jurisdictions with the

.cording to its meanderings, or windings and turn-
ings. See Jones v. Pettibone, 2 Wis. 317.

## MEANDER LINES

Lines run in surveying par-
ticular portions of the public lands which border
on navigable rivers, not as boundaries of the tract,
but for the purpose of defining the sinuosities of
the banks of the stream, and as the means of as-
certaining the quantity of land in the fraction sub-
ject to sale, and which is to be paid for by the pur-
chaser. In preparing the official plat from the
field notes, the meander line is represented as the
border line of the stream, and shows that the wa-
tercourse, and not the meander line as naturally
run on the ground, is the boundary. St. Paul & P.
R. Co. v. Schurmeier, 7 Wall. 286, 19 L.Ed. 74;

## MEANING

That which is, or is intended to be,
signified or denoted by act or language; significa-
tion; sense; import. Webster, Dict.
Secondary Meaning. While generic names, geographical
names, and names composed of words which are merely
descriptive are incapable of exclusive appropriation, words
or names, which have a primary meaning of their own,
such as words descriptive of the goods, service, or place
where they are made, or the name of the maker, may
nevertheless, by long use in connection with the business
of the particular trade, come to be understood by the pub-
lic as designating the goods, service, or business of a par-
ticular trader. This is what is known as the doctrine of
"secondary meaning" ; and is the origin of the law of
unfair competition, as distinguished from technical trade-
marks or trade-names. Saunders System Atlanta Co. v.
Drive It Yourself Co., 158 Ga. 1, 123 S.E. 132, 135; Rich-
mond Remedies Co. v. Dr. Miles Medical Co., C.C.A.Mo.,

which, an end is attained; something tending to

In the ordinary sense of
the word, "measure" would mean something by
comparison with which we may ascertain what is
the value of anything. When we consider, further,
that value itself is relative, and that two things
are necessary to constitute it, independently of the
third thing, which is to measure it, we may define
a "measure of value" to be something by compar-
ing with which any two other things we may in-
fer their value in relation to one another. 2 Mill,
Pol. Econ. 101.
MEASURER, or METER. An officer in the city

adopted, instead of another, by any person skilled
in the particular art from his knowledge of the
art, and which is competent to perform the same
functions or produce the same result, without in-
troducing an original idea or changing the general

## MEMOIRE

In French law, a document in the
form of a petition, by which appeals to the court
of cassation are initiated:
MEMORANDUM. Lat. To be remembered; be It
remembered. A formal word with which the body
of a record in the court of king's bench anciently
commenced. Townsh. PL 486; 2 Tidd, Pr. 719.
Also an informal note or instrument embody-
ing something that the parties desire to fix in
memory by the aid of written evidence, or that is
to serve as the basis of a future formal contract
or deed. Plott v. Kittelson, 58 N.D. 881, 228 N.W.
217, 221.
This word is used in the statute of frauds as
the designation of the written agreement, or note
or evidence thereof, which must exist in order to
bind the parties in the cases provided. The mem-
orandum must be such as to disclose the parties,
the nature and substance of the contract, the con-
sideration and promise, and be signed by the party
to be bound or his authorized agent. See 2 Kent,
Comm. 510; Des Brisay v. Foss, 264 Mass. 102, 162
N.E. 4, 6.
The whole clause is now, in practice, termed, from this
initial word, the "memorandum," and its use is supposed
to have originated from the circumstance that proceedings
"by bill" (in which alone it has been employed) were for-
merly considered as the by-business of the court. Gilb.
Com.P1. 47, 48.

## MEMORANDUM ARTICLES

In the law of mar-
ine insurance, this phrase designates the articles
of merchandise which are usually mentioned in
the memorandum clause, (q. v.,) and for which
the underwriter's liability is thereby limited. See
Waln v. Thompson, 9 Serg. & R., Pa., 120, 11 Am.
Dec. 675.

## MEMORANDUM CHECK

See Check.

## MEMORANDUM CLAUSE

In a policy of marine
insurance the memorandum clause is a clause in-
serted to prevent the underwriters from being
liable for injury to goods of a peculiarly perisha-
ble nature, and for minor damages. It begins as
follows: "N. B. Corn, fish, salt, fruit, flour, and
seed are warranted free from average, unless
general, or the ship be stranded,"—meaning that
the underwriters are not to be liable for damage
to these articles caused by seawater or the like.
Maude & P. Shipp. 371; Sweet.

## MEMORANDUM IN ERROR

A document alleg-
ing error in fact, accompanied by an affidavit of
such matter of fact.

## MEMORANDUM OF ALTERATION

Formerly,
in England, where a patent was granted for two
inventions, one of which was not new or not use-
ful, the whole patent was bad, and the same rule
applied when a material part of a patent for a
single invention had either of those defects. To
remedy this the statute 5 & 6 Wm. IV. c. 83, em-
powers a patentee (with the fiat of the attorney
general) to enter a disclaimer (q. v.) or a mem-
orandum of an alteration in the title or specifica-
tion of the patent, not being of such a nature as
to extend the exclusive right granted by the pat-
ent, and thereupon the memorandum is deemed to
be part of the letters patent or the specification.
Sweet.

## MEMORANDUM OF ASSOCIATION

ment to be subscribed by seven or more persons
associated for a lawful purpose, by subscribing

tive body, or to the executive, by one or more in-

tered, as in the case of an annuity which must be
registered. Wharton.
In practice, a short note, abstract, memoran-
dum, or rough draft of the orders of the court,
from which the records thereof may at any time
be fully made up. State v. Shaw, 73 Vt. 149, 50 A.

## IMEMORITER

instrument is such as is furnished by the recol-
lection of a witness who had seen and known it.

in derogation of the rights of the author. 5 Term
R. 245; 14 A.L.R., N.S. 207.

## MEMORY

The word as used in Blackstone and
other ancient authorities, appeared to be synony-
mous with "mind", whereas the word "memory"
in modern times is used in a more restricted sense
of recollection of past events rather than the
general state of one's mental power. United
States v. Boylen, D.C.Or., 41 F.Supp. 724, 725.
Mental capacity; the mental power to review
and recognize the successive states of conscious-
ness in their consecutive order.
This word, as used in jurisprudence to denote one of the
psychological elements necessary in the making of a valid
will or contract or the commission of a crime, implies the
mental power to conduct a consecutive train of thought, or
an orderly planning of affairs, by recalling correctly the
past states of the mind and past events, and arranging
them in their due order of sequence and in their logical
relations with the events and mental states of the present.
The phrase "sound and disposing mind and memory"
means not merely distinct recollection of the items of one's
property and the persons among whom it may be given,
but entire power of mind to dispose of property by will.
Abbott.
The reputation and name, good or bad, which a
man leaves at his death.
Legal memory. An ancient usage, custom, sup-
posed grant (as a foundation for prescription) and
the like, are said to be immemorial when they
are really or fictitiously of such an ancient date
that "the memory of man runneth not to the con-
trary," or, in other words, "beyond legal memory."
And legal memory or "time out of mind," accord-
ing to the rule of the common law, commenced
from the reign of Richard I., A. D. 1189. But
under the statute of limitation of 32 Hen. VIII.
this was reduced to 60 years, and again by that
of 2 & 3 Wm. IV. c. 71, to 20 years. In the Ameri-
can states, by statute, the time of legal memory
is generally fixed at a period corresponding to that
prescribed for actions for the recovery of real
property, usually about 20 years. See 2 Bl.Comm. •
31; Miller v. Garlock, 8 Barb., N.Y. 153.

## MEN OF STRAW

Men who used in former days
to ply about courts of law, so called from their
manner of making known their occupation, (i. e.,
by a straw in one of their shoes,) recognized by
the name of "straw-shoes." An advocate or lawyer i
who wanted a convenient witness knew by these f
signs where to meet with one, and the colloquy
between the parties was brief. "Don't you remem-
ber?" said the advocate; to which the ready an-
swer was, "To be sure I do." "Then come into
court and swear it?' And straw-shoes went into
court and swore. Athens abounded in straw-shoes. s
Quart. Rev. vol. 33, p. 344. c

others being swallowed up or merged therein.
Metropolitan Edison Co. v. Commissioner of In-
ternal Revenue, C.C.A.3, 98 F.2d 807, 810, 811. It

Real-Property Law. It is a general principle of
law that where a greater estate and a less coin-
cide and meet in one and the same person, without
any intermediate estate, the less is immediately
annihilated, or, in the law phrase, is said to be
merged, that is, sunk or drowned, in the greater.
Thus, if there be tenant for years, and the rever-
sion in fee-simple descends to or is purchased by
him, the term of years is merged in the inheri-
tance, and shall never exist any more. 2 Bl.
Comm. 177; 1 Steph. Comm. 293; 4 Kent, Comm.
99. Duncan v. Smith, 31 N.J.L. 327.
Rights. This term, as applied to rights, is equiv-
alent to "confusio" in the Roman law, and in-
dicates that where the qualities of debtor and cred
itor become united in the same individual, there
arises a confusion of rights which extinguishes
both qualities; whence, also, merger is often calle
Rights of Action. In the law relating to rights
of action, when a person takes or acquires a rem-
edy or security of a higher nature, in legal estima-
tion, than the one which he already possesses for
the same right, then his remedies in respect of
the minor right or security merge in those attach-
ing to the higher one. Leake, Cont. 506; 10 C.B.
561. As where a claim is merged in the judgment
recovered upon it. Frost v. Thompson, 219 Mass.
360, 106 N.E. 1009, 1010.

or supplier. U. S. v. General Dynamics Corp.,

Hammond v. Squier, D.C.Wash., 51 F.Supp. 227,
MILITARY JURISDICTION. There are under the
Constitution, three kinds of military jurisdiction:
one to be exercised both in peace and war; another
to be exercised in time of foreign war without the
boundaries of the United States or in time of re-
bellion and civil war within states or districts oc-
third to be exercised in time of invasion or insur.
rection within the limits of the United States or
during rebellion within the limits of states main-
taining adhesion to the National Government,
when the public danger requires its exercise. The
first of these may be called jurisdiction under
"military law" and is found in acts of Congress
prescribing rules and articles of war, or otherwise
providing for the government of the national forc-
es; the second may be distinguished as "military
government" superseding, as far as may be deem-
ed expedient the local law, and exercised by the
military commander under the direction of the
President, with the express or implied sanction of
Congress; while the third may be denominated
"martial law", and is called into action by Con-
gress, or temporarily when the action of Congress
cannot be invited, and in the face of justifying or
excusing peril, by the President in times of insur-
rection or invasion, or of civil or foreign war, with-

service of the government; whereas, martial law,

and soldiers and supersedes civil law. U. S. ex
rel. Wessels v. McDonald, D.C.N.Y., 265 F. 754,

N.Y.Supp. 615; In re Bergin, 31 Wis. 386; Walsh v. Peo-
ple, 65 Ill. 65, 16 Am. Rep. 569.
Under modern statutes the distinction between felonies
and misdemeanors is not whether the offense is infamous,
but whether it is punishable by imprisonment in the peni-
tentiary or capitally, in which case it is a "felony" ; other-
wise a "misdemeanor." Jones v. Brinkley, 174 N.C. 23, 93

feasance" is the doing of an act which a person ought not
to do at all. Proksch v. Bettendorf, 218 Iowa 1376, 257
N.W. 383. But "misfeasance" is often used in the sense of

Okl.Cr. 361, 211 P. 517, 518.

understood by the jury, or to give them a wrong
impression, are said to be "misleading."
MISNOMER. Mistake in name; giving incorrect
name to person in accusation, indictment, plead-
ing, deed or other instrument. Culpepper v. State,
173 Ga. 799, 161 S.E. 623.

## MISPLEADING

Pleading incorrectly, or omit-
ting anything in pleading which is essential to the
support or defense of an action, is so called; as
in the case of a plaintiff not merely stating his
title in a defective manner, but setting forth a
title which is essentially defective in itself; or if,
to an action of debt, the defendant pleads "not
guilty" instead of nil debet. Brown. Lovett v.
Pell, 22 Wend., N.Y., 376; Chicago & A. IL Co. v.
Murphy, 198 Ill. 462, 64 N.E. 1011.

sertion not in accordance with the facts. A. P.
Landis, Inc., v. Mellinger, 116 Pa.Super. 167, 175 A.
745, 746.
An untrue statement of fact. An incorrect or false rep-
resentation. That which, if accepted, leads the mind to
an apprehension of a condition other and different from
that which exists. Colloquially it is understood to mean a
statement made to deceive or mislead. Haigh v. White
Way Laundry Co., 164 Iowa 143, 145 N.W. 473, 474, 50
L.R.A.,N.S., 1091; Zackwik v. Hanover Fire Ins. Co., Mo.
App., 225 S.W. 135, 138.

Wynn, 137 Va. 186, 119 S.E. 133, 135.
A "misrepresentation," which justifies the rescission of a
contract, is a false statement of a substantive fact, or any
conduct which leads to a belief of a substantive fact mate-
rial to proper understanding of the matter in hand, made
with intent to deceive or mislead. Rhodes v. Uhl, 189 Iowa
408, 178 N.W. 394, 400.
Misrepresentation such as will amount to false pretense
is not confined to mere oral misstatements of fact but in-
cludes distribution of printed matter, or a course of con-
duct, manifestly intended to deceive as to conditions actu-
ally existing. Commonwealth v. Dougherty, 84 Pa.Super.
Ct. 319, 321.
False or fraudulent misrepresentation is a representation
contrary to the fact, made by a person with a knowledge
of its falsehood, and being the cause of the other party's
entering into the contract. 6 Clark & F. 232.
Negligent misrepresentation is a false representation
made by a person who has no reasonable grounds for
believing it to be true, though he does not know that it is
untrue, or even believes it to be true. L.R. 4 H.L. 79.
misrepresentation occurs where the person mak-
ing the representation had reasonable grounds for believ-
ing it to be true. L.R. 2 Q.B. 580.

## MISTAKE

Some unintentional act, omission, or
error arising from ignorance, surprise, imposition,
or misplaced confidence. Code Ga. § 3117, Civ.
Code 1910, § 4570; 1 Story, Eq. Jur. § 110.
A mistake exists when a person, under some
erroneous conviction of law or fact, does, or omits
to do, some act which, but for the erroneous con-
viction, he would not have done or omitted.
Jeremy, Eq. Jur. 358; Ward v. Lyman, 108 Vt.
464, 188 A. 892, 896. It may arise either from
unconsciousness, ignorance, forgetfulness, imposi-
tion, or misplaced confidence. Bisph. Eq. § 185;
Salazar v. Steelman, 22 Cal.App.2d 402, 71 P.2d
79, 82.
Mistake of fact is a mistake not caused by the neglect of
a legal duty on the part of the person making the mistake,
and consisting in (1) an unconscious ignorance or forget-
fulness of a fact, past or present, material to the contract;
or (2) belief in the present existence of a thing material
to the contract which does not exist, or in the past exist-
ence of such a thing which has not existed. Callan Court
Co. v. Citizens & Southern Nat. Bank, 184 Ga. 87, 190 S.E.
831,854.
A mistake of law happens when a party, having full
knowledge of the facts, comes to an erroneous conclusion
as to their legal effect. It is a mistaken opinion or infer-
ence, arising from an imperfect or incorrect exercise of the
judgment, upon facts, Page v. Provines, 179 Okl. 391, 66
P.2d 7, 10; and necessarily presupposes that the person
forming it is in full possession of the facts. The facts
precede the law, and the true and false opinion alike imply
an acquaintance with them. The one is the result of a
correct application of legal principles, which every man is
presumed to know, and is called "law ;" the other, the
result of a faulty application, and is called a "mistake of
law." Hurd v. Hall, 12 Wis. 124; Barnett v. Douglas, 102
Okl. 85, 226 P. 1035, 1037, 39 A.L.R. 188.
Mutual mistake is where the parties have a common
intention, but it is induced by a common or mutual mis-
take. Paine-Fishburn Granite Co. v. Reynoldson, 115 Neb.
520, 213 N.W. 750, 751; Northwest Thresher Co. v. Mc-
Ninch, 42 Okl. 155, 140 P. 1170, 1172. "Mutual" as used in
the expression mutual mistake of fact expresses a thought
of reciprocity and distinguishes it from a mistake which is
a common mistake of both parties. There is something of
the thought of a common mistake because it must affect
both parties. Mistake of fact as ground for relief may be
neither "mutual" nor common in the strict sense because
it may be wholly the mistake of one of the parties, the
other being wholly ignorant both of the fact upon the faith
of which the other has mistakenly acted and that the other
has acted upon such an understanding of the fact situation.
United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. v. Heller, D.C.Pa.,
259 F. 885, 890; Litteral v. Bevins, 186 Ky. 514, 217 S.W.
369, 370.

## MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES

gree of moral culpability. Heaton v. Wright, 10
How.Prac., N.Y. 82. Those that affect basis for
award of exemplary damages, or reduce actual
damages by showing, not that they were never
suffered, but that they have been partially ex-
tinguished. McClelland v. Climax Hosiery Mills,
252 N.Y. 347, 169 N.E. 605, 608. And in actions for
libel and slander, circumstances bearing on de-
ducing moral culpability, or on liability for actual
damages by showing partial extinguishment there-
of. Civil Practice Act, §§ 262, 338. Fleckenstein
v. Friedman, 266 N.Y. 19, 193 N.E. 537, 539.

A name given to an inter-

alities, whether native or European, but criminal charges
against natives are heard in the native criminal courts and
those against Europeans in the proper consular courts.
There are three first instance courts, one at Alexandria
with eighteen judges, of whom twelve are foreign, one at
Cairo with nineteen judges, of whom thirteen are foreign.
and one at Mansurah with nine judges, of whom six are
foreign, and a Court of Appeal sitting at Alexandria, corn-
posed of fifteen judges. The jurisdiction cannot be in-
voked unless one party is a foreigner, but it is said to be

claims to foreigners, so as to get them into these courts.

are subjects of various European states, and of the United
States and Brazil. They are appointed by their respective
governments; Milner, England in Egypt.

ment," for the former term denotes some minor change in
the substance of the thing, without reference to its im-
provement or deterioration thereby, while the latter word
imports an amelioration of the thing (as by changing the

In its strict technical sense, "money" means coined
metal, usually gold or silver, upon which the government
stamp has been impressed to indicate its value. In its
more popular sense, "money" means any currency, tokens,
bank-notes, or other circulating medium in general use as
the representative of value. Kennedy v. Briere, 45 Tex.
305; Cook v. State, 130 ,Nrk. 90, 196 S. W. 922, 924; Vick

The simple meaning of "money" is current coin, but it
may mean possessions expressible in money values. "Mon-
ey" has no technical meaning, but is of ambiguous import,
and may be interpreted having regard to all surrounding
circumstances under which it is used. "Money" is often
and popularly used as equivalent to "property." "Money"
means wealth reckoned in terms of money; capital con-
sidered as a cash asset; specifically such wealth or capital
dealt in as a commodity to be loaned, invested, or the like;
wealth considered as a cash asset. Salt Lake County v.
Utah Copper Co., C.C.A.Utah, 93 F.2d 127, 132.
In its more comprehensive and general sense, it means
wealth,—the representative of commodities of all kinds, of
lands, and of everything that can be transferred in com-
merce. Paul v. Ball, 31 Tex. 10. A general, indefinite
term for the measure and representative of value.

Cal. App. 18, 225 P. 36, 39. Under a statute, all money

## MONEY CHANGERS

A money changer is one

ing of the term pertained to those persons who, in
early history, engaged in the business of foreign

and buying and selling of uncurrent funds and the
exchanging of one kind of money for another. Ar-
nold v. City of Chicago, 387 Ill. 532, 56 N.E.2d 795,
MONEY CLAIMS. In English practice, under the
judicature act of 1875, claims for the price of goods
sold, for money lent, for arrears of rent, etc., and
other claims where money is directly payable on a
contract express or implied, as opposed to the cas-
es where money is claimed by way of damages for
some independent wrong, whether by breach of
contract or otherwise. These "money claims" cor-
respond very nearly to the "money counts" hith-
erto in use. Mozley & Whitley.

## MONEY DEMAND

uidated amount of money, or for a sum which
can be ascertained by mere calculation; in this

is either a simple monition in personam or an at-
tachment and monition in rem. Ben.Adm. 228,
It is sometimes termed "monition viis et modis," and
has been supposed to be derived from the old Roman prac-
tice of summoning a defendant. Manro v. Almeida, 10
Wheat. 490, 6 L.Ed. 369.
The monition, in American admiralty practice, is, in
effect, a summons, citation, or notice, though in form a
command to the marshal to cite and admonish the defend-
ant to appear and answer, and not a summons addressed to
the party. 2 Conk.Adm., 2d Ed., 147.
General monition. In civil law and admiralty
practice, a monition or summons to all parties in
interest to appear and show cause against the de-
cree prayed for.
Practice. A monition is a formal order of the
court commanding something to be done by the
person to whom it is directed, and who is called
the "person monished." Thus, when money is de-
creed to be paid, a monition may be obtained com-
manding its payment. In ecclesiastical procedure,
a monition is an order monishing or warning the
party complained against to do or not to do a cer-
tain act "under pain of the law and contempt there-
of." A monition may also be appended to a sen-
tence inflicting a punishment for a past offense;
in that case the monition forbids the repetition of
MONITORY LETTERS. Communications of
warning and admonition sent from an ecclesias-
tical judge, upon information of scandal and abus-
es within the cognizance of his court.

the common law methods of obtaining possession

the Gregorian calendar,—January, February, March, etc.,
—which are of unequal length.

MORAL ACTIONS. Those only in which men
have knowledge to guide them, and a will to choose
for themselves. Ruth, Inst. lib. 1, c. 1.

## MORAL CERTAINTY

That degree of assurance
which induces a man of sound mind to act, with-
out doubt, upon the conclusions to which it leads.
Wills, Circ.Ev. 7. A high degree of impression of
the truth of a fact, falling short of absolute cer-
tainty, but sufficient to justify a verdict of guilty,
even in a capital case. Burrill, Circ.Ev. 198-200.
As explained in the Century Dictionary, it signifies a
probability sufficiently strong to justify action on it. In
Webster's International, the first definition given is, "a
very high degree of probability, although not demonstra-
ble, as a certainty." It has also been used as indicating a
conclusion of the mind established beyond a reasonable
doubt. Gray v. State, 56 Okl.Cr. 208, 38 P.2d 967.
The phrase "moral certainty" has been introduced into
our jurisprudence from the publicists and metaphysicians,
and signifies only a very high degree of probability. It
was observed by Puffendorf that, "when we declare such
a thing to be morally certain, because it has been con-
firmed by credible witnesses, this moral certitude is noth-
ing else but a strong presumption grounded on probable
reasons, and which very seldom fails and deceives us."
"Probable evidence," says Bishop Butler, in the opening
sentence of his Analogy, "is essentially distinguished from
demonstrative by this: that it admits of degrees, and of
all variety of them, from the highest moral certainty to the
very lowest presumption." Corn. v. Costley, 118 Mass. 23.

## MORAL CONSIDERATION

See Consideration.

## MORAL DURESS

ette Dramatic Productions v. Ferentz, 305 Mich.
193, 9 N.W.2d 57, 66, 145 A.L.R. 1158.

## MORAL EVIDENCE

As opposed to "mathemati-
cal" or "demonstrative" evidence, this term de-
notes that kind of evidence which, without devel-
oping an absolute and necessary certainty, gener-
ates a high degree of probability or persuasive
force. It is founded upon analogy or induction, ex-
perience of the ordinary course of nature or the
sequence of events, and the testimony of men.

## MORAL FRAUD

This phrase is one of the less
usual designations of "actual" or "positive" fraud
or "fraud in fact," as distinguished from "con-
structive" fraud or "fraud in law." It means fraud
which involves actual guilt, a wrongful purpose,
or moral obliquity.

## MORAL HAZARD

See Hazard.

## MORAL INSANITY

See Insanity,
MORAL LAW. The law of conscience; the ag-
gregate of those rules and principles of ethics
,
which relate to right and wrong conduct and pre-

L.R.A. 279.

of all or of certain legal remedies against debtors,
sometimes authorized by law during financial dis-
tress. Brown v. State Nat. Bank of Shawnee, 133
Okl. 173, 271 P. 833, 834. A period of permissive
or obligatory delay; specifically, a period during
which an obligor has a legal right to delay meeting
an obligation. State ex rel. Jensen Livestock Co.
v. Hyslop, 111 Mont. 122, 107 P.2d 1088, 1092.

## MORATUR IN LEGE

Lat. He delays in law.
The phrase describes the action of one who de-
murs, because the party does not proceed in plead-
ing, but rests or abides upon the judgment of the
court on a certain point, as to the legal sufficiency
of his opponent's pleading. The courts deliberate
and determine thereupon.

## MORAVIANS

Otherwise called "Herrnhutters"
or "United Brethren." A sect of Christians whose
social polity is particular and conspicuous. It
sprung up in Moravia and Bohemia, on the open-
ing of that reformation which stripped the chair
of St. Peter of so many votaries, and gave birth
to so many denominations of Christians. They
give evidence on their solemn affirmation. 2
Steph.Comm. 338n.

band-like manner. Townsh.Pl. 198.

proximately; implying that both parties assume
the risk of any ordinary discrepancy. Alexander
v. Hicks, 242 Ala. 243, 5 So.2d 781, 782, 783.
The words are intended to cover slight or unimportant
inaccuracies in quantity, Carter v. Finch, 186 Ark. 954, 57
S.W.2d 408; and are ordinarily to be interpreted as taking
care of unsubstantial differences or differences of small
importance compared to the whole number of items trans-
ferred. Crawl v. Box, 144 Okl. 25, 288 P. 942, 946.

## MOREOVER

In addition thereto, also, further-
more, likewise, beyond this, besides this. Pagano
v. Cerri, 93 Ohio St. 345, 112 N.E. 1037, 1040, L.R.A.

other employed salaried people, the contract calling
for installment payments over a one year period.
Other secured loans are also made. Board of

case of the death of a party to an action.
MORSELLUM, or MORSELLUS, TERRIE. In old
English law, a small parcel or bit of land.
MORT CIVILE, In French law, civil death, as
upon conviction for felony.
It was nominally abolished by a law of the 31st of May,
1854, but something very similar to it, in effect at least,
still remains. Thus, the property of the condemned, pos-
sessed by him at the date of his conviction, goes and be-
longs to his successors, (hOritiers,) as in case of an intes-
tacy; and his future acquired property goes to the state
by right of its prerogative, (par droit de desUrence,) but
the state may, as a matter of grace, make it over in whole
or in part to the widow and children. Brown.

## MORT D'ANCESTOR

An ancient and now almost
obsolete remedy in the English law. An assize of
mort d'ancestor was a writ which lay for a person
whose ancestor died seised of lands in fee-simple,
and after his death a stranger abated; and this
writ directed the sheriff to summon a jury or as-
size, who should view the land in question and rec-
ognize whether such ancestor were seised thereof
on the day of his death, and whether the demand-
ant were the next heir.

## MORTAL

Destructive to life; causing or occa-
sioning death; exposing to or deserving death, es-
pecially spiritual death; deadly; fatal; as, a mor-
tal wound, State v. Logan, 344 Mo. 351, 126 S.W.2d
256, 259, 122 A.L.R. 417; or mortal sin; of or per-
taining to time of death. State v. Baker, 122 Kan.
552, 253 P. 221, 223.

## MORTALITY

This word, in its ordinary sense,
never means violent death, but death arising from
natural causes. Lawrence 'v. Aberdein, 5 Barn. &
Ald. 110.

## MORTALITY TABLES

A means of ascertaining
the probable number of years any man or woman
of a given age and of ordinary health will live.
Butler v. Butler, 180 Minn. 134, 230 N.W.

## MORTGAGE

An estate created by a conveyance
absolute in its form, but intended to secure the
performance of some act, such as the payment of
money, and the like, by the grantor or some other
person, and to become void if the act is performed
agreeably to the terms prescribed at the time of
making such conveyance. 1 Washb.Real Prop.
*475.
A conditional conveyance of land. Mitchell v.
Burnham, 44 Me. 299.
A transfer of property passing conditionally as
security for debt. Potter v. Vernon, 129 Okl. 251,
264 P. 611, 613.
A debt by specialty, secured by a pledge of lands,
of which the legal ownership is vested in the credi-
tor, but of which, in equity, the debtor and those
claiming under him remain the actual owners, un-
til debarred by judicial sentence or their own lach-
es, Coote, Mortg. 1.
The foregoing definitions are applicable to the
common-law conception of a mortgage. But in
many states in modern times, it is regarded as a
mere lien, and not as creating a title or estate.
Zeigler v. Sawyer, Tex.Civ.App., 16 S.W.2d 894,
896. It is a pledge or security of particular prop-
erty for the payment of a debt or the performance
of some other obligation, whatever form the trans-
action may take, but is not now regarded as a con-
veyance in effect, though it may be cast in the
form of a conveyance. Muth v. Goddard, 28 Mont.
237, 72 P. 621, 98 Am.St.Rep. 553; Johnson v. Rob-
inson, 68 Tex. 399, 4 S.W. 625; Killebrew v. Hines,
104 N.C. 182, 10 S.E. 159, 17 Am.St.Rep. 672;
Stockel v. Elich, 297 P. 595, 597, 112 Cal.App. 588;
In re Morgan, D.C.N.J., 39 F.2d 489, 490.
Chattel mortgage. A mortgage of goods, chat-
tels, or personal property. See Chattel Mortgage.
Conventional mortgage. The conventional mort-
gage is a contract by which a person binds the
whole of his property, or a portion of it only, in
favor of another, to secure the execution of some
engagement, but without divesting himself of pos-
session. Civ.Code La. art. 3290; Succession of Ben-
jamin, 39 La.Ann. 612, 2 So. 187. It is distin-
guished from the "legal" mortgage, which is a
privilege which the law alone in certain cases gives
to a creditor over the property of his debtor, with-
out stipulation of the parties. This last is very
much like a general lien at common law, created by
the law rather than by the act of the parties, such
as a judgment lien.
Equitable mortgage. A specific lien upon real
property to secure the payment of money or the
performance of some other obligation, which a
court of equity will recognize and enforce, in ac-
cordance with the clearly ascertained intent of the
parties to that effect, but which lacks the essential
features of a legal mortgage, either because it
grows out of the transactions of the parties with-
out any deed or express contract to give a lien,
or because the instrument used for that purpose
Is wanting in some of the characteristics of a
common-law mortgage, or, being absolute in form,
right to redeem, or because an explicit agreement
to 'Wye a mortgage has not been. carried into effect.
4 Kent, Comm. 150; 2 Story, Eq.Jur. § 1018;
Ketchum v. St. Louis, 101 U.S. 306, 25 L.Ed. 999;
Gessner v. Palmateer, 89 Cal. 89, 26 P. 789, 13
L.R.A. 187.
In English law, the following mortgages are equitable:
(1) Where the subject of a mortgage is trust property,
which security is effected either by a formal deed or a
written memorandum, notice being given to the trustees
in order to preserve the priority. (2) Where it is an equity
of redemption, which is merely a right to bring an action
in the chancery division to redeem the estate. (3) Where
there is a written agreement only to make a mortgage,
which creates an equitable lien on the land. (4) Where a
debtor deposits the title-deeds of his estate with his
creditor or some person on his behalf, without even a
verbal communication. The deposit itself is deemed evi-
dence of an executed agreement or contract for a mortgage
for such estate. Wharton.
First mortgage. The first (in time or right) of a
series of two or more mortgages covering the same
property and successively attaching as liens upon
it; also, in a more particular sense, a mortgage
which is a first lien on the property, not only as
against other mortgages, but as against any other
charges or incurnbrances. Green's Appeal, 97 Pa.
First mortgage bonds. Bonds the payment of
which is secured by a first mortgage on property.
Bank of Atchison County v. Byers, 139 Mo. 627, 41
S.W. 325; Corn. v. Williamstown, 156 Mass. 70, 30
N.E. 472.
General mortgage. Mortgages are sometimes
classified as general and special, a mortgage of
the former class being one which binds all prop-
erty, present and future, of the debtor (sometimes
called a "blanket" mortgage) ; while a special
mortgage is limited to certain particular and speci-
fied property. Barnard v. Erwin, 2 Rob., La., 415.
Judicial mortgage. In the law of Louisiana, the
lien resulting from judgments, whether rendered
on contested cases or by default, whether final or
provisional, in favor of the person obtaining them.
Civ.Code La. art. 3321.
Legal mortgage. A term used in Louisiana.
The law alone in c,rtain cases gives to the credi-
tor a mortgage on the property of his debtor, with-
out it being requisite that the parties should stipu-
late it. This is called "legal mortgage." Civ.Code
La. art. 3311.
Mortgage of goods. A conveyance of goods in
gage or mortgage by which the whole legal title
passes conditionally to the mortgagee; and, if the
goods are not redeemed at the time stipulated, the
title becomes absolute in law, although equity will
interfere to compel a redemption. It is distin-
guished from a "pledge" by the circumstance that
possession by the mortgagee is not or may not be
essential to create or to support the title. Story,
Bailm. § 287. See Chattel Mortgage.
Purchase-money mortgage. A mortgage given,
concurrently with a conveyance of land, by the
vendee to the vendor, on the same land, to secure
the unpaid balance of the purchase price. Baker v.
Clepper, 26 Tex. 629, 84 Am.Dec. 591; Keefe v.
Cropper, 196 Iowa 1179, 194 N.W. 305, 306; Ladd
& Tilton Bank v. Mitchell, 93 Or. 668, 184 P. 282,
284, 6 A.L.R. 1420.
Second mortgage. One which takes rank im-
mediately after a first mortgage on the same prop-
erty, without any intervening liens, and is next
entitled to satisfaction out of the proceeds of the
property. Green's Appeal, 97 Pa. 347. Properly
speaking, however, the term designates the second
of a series of mortgages, not necessarily the second
lien. For instance, the lien of a judgment might
intervene between the first and second mortgages;
in which case, the second mortgage would be the
third lien.
Tacit mortgage. In Louisiana, the same as a
"legal" mortgage. See supra.
Welsh mortgage. In English law, a species of
security which partakes of the nature of a mort-
gage, as there is a debt due, and an estate is given
as security for the repayment, but differs from it
in the circumstances that the rents and profits are
to be received without account till the principal
money is paid off, and there is no remedy to en-
force payment, while the mortgagor has a per-
petual power of redemption. It is now rarely used.
1 Pow.Mortg. 373a; Bentley v. Phelps, 3 F.Cas.

## MORTGAGE POOLS

## MORTGAGEE IN POSSESSION

A mortgagee of
real property who is in possession of it with the
agreement or assent of the mortgagor, express

prerequisite to his being dispossessed. Rogers v.
Benton, 39 Minn. 39, 38 N.W. 765, 12 Am.St.Rep.
613; Stouffer v. Harlan, 68 Kan. 135, 74 P. 610,

Sur., N.Y., 245, 250.

## MORTMAIN

A term applied to denote the aliena-
tion of lands or tenements to any corporation, sole
or aggregate, ecclesiastical or temporal. These
purchases having been chiefly made by religious
houses, in consequence of which lands became per-
petually inherent in one dead hand, this has oc-
casioned the general appellation of "mortmain" to
be applied to such alienations. 2 Bl.Comm. 268;
Co.Litt. 2b; Perin v. Carey, 24 How. 495, 16 L.Ed.

## MORTMAIN ACTS

These acts had for their ob-
ject to prevent lands getting into the possession or
control of religious corporations, or, as the name
indicates, in mortua mane. After numerous prior
acts dating from the reign of Edward I., it was
enacted by the statute 9 Geo. II. c. 36, (called the
"Mortmain Act" par excellence), that no lands
should be given to charities unless certain requi-
sites should be observed. Brown. Yates v. Yates,
9 Barb., N.Y., 324.

## MORTON TOE

"Morton toe" is neuralgia of the
fourth toe. State v. Armstrong, 38 Idaho 493, 225
P. 491, 493, 33 A.L.R. 835.

## MORTUARY

A kind of ecclesiastical heriot, being a customary
gift of the second best living animal belonging to
the deceased, claimed by and due to the minister

in an ecclesiastical sense, and applied to a payment
to the lord of the fee. Paroch.Antiq. 470.

## MORTUARY TABLES

Tables for estimating the
probable duration of the life of a party at a given
age. Gallagher v. Market St. Ry. Co., 67 Cal. 16,
6 P. 871, 51 Am.Rep. 680.

## MORTUUM VADIUM

A dead pledge; a mort-
gage (q. v.) ; a pledge where the profits or rents
of the thing pledged are not applied to the pay-
ment of the debt.

## MORTUUS

Lat. Dead. So in sheriff's return.
mortuus est, he is dead.

## MORTUUS CIVILITER

Civil death.
This incident attended every attainder of treason or oth-
er felony, whereby in the language of Lord Coke the at-
tainted person "is disabled to bring any action, for he is
extra legem mortuus"; Co.Litt. 199. He could be heard
in court only for the direct purpose of reversing the at-
tainder, and not in prosecution of a civil right; 1 B. & A.
159. He could be grantor or grantee after attainder, and
the grant would be good against all persons except the
:MORTUUS EXITUS NON EST EXITUS. A dead
issue is no issue. Co.Litt. 29. A child born dead
is not considered as issue.

## MORTUUS SINE PROLE

Dead without issue.
In genealogical tables often abbreviated to "m.
8. p.”

## MOS RETINENDUS EST FIDELISSIMIE VET- USTATIS

4 Coke, 78. A custom of the truest
antiquity is to be retained.

## MOSCOW INTERNATIONAL

See Third Interna-
tional.

## MOSLEM LAW

One of the two great systems of
customary law which the English found in India.
It regulated the life and relations of all Moslems,
and parts of it, especially its penal provisions, were
applied to both Moslems and Hindus. Bryce, Ex-
tension of the Law.

## MOST FAVORED NATION CLAUSE

A clause
found in most treaties providing that the citizens
or subjects of the contracting states may enjoy the
privileges accorded by either party to those of the
most favored nations. It is said that the general
design of such clauses is to establish the principle
of equality of international treatment. The test
of whether this principle is violated by the conces-
sion of advantages to a particular nation is, not
the form in which such concession is made, but
the condition on which it is granted; whether it
is given for a price, or whether this price is in
the nature of a substantial equivalent, and not of
a mere evasion. The United States has always tak-
en the stand that reciprocal commercial conces-
sions are given for a valuable consideration and
are not within the scope of this clause. Whitney
v. Robertson, 124 U.S. 190, 8 S.Ct. 456, 31 L.Ed. 386.
Great Britain has taken the opposite position.
See Consular Treaty Rights and Comments on
the "Most Favored Nation" Clause, by Ernest Lud-
wig; 3 Amer.Journ.Int.L. 57; Herod, Most Favored
Nation Treatment; Moore's Dig.Int.Law; 3 Amer.
Journ.Int.Law 395.

A female parent, Guide Pub. Co. v. Futrell, 175
Va. 77, 7 S.E.2d 133, 138. Correlative to "son" or
"daughter." The term includes maternity during
prebirth period. Watson v. Independent Banner of
Love Soc., 54 Ga.App. 370, 187 S.E. 897, 898.

## MOTHER-IN-LAW

MOTION. Parliamentary law. The formal mode
in which a member submits a proposed measure
or resolve for the consideration and action of the
meeting.
Practice. Primarily an application for a rule or
order made viva voce to a court or judge, but the

such applications, whether written or oral. Irwin
v. Gilson Realty Co., 117 Fla. 394, 158 So. 77.
Special motion. A motion addressed to the dis-
cretion of the court, and which must be heard and
determined; as distinguished from one which may

motion for decree. Hunter, Suit Eq. 59; Daniell,
Ch.Pr. 722.

## MOTION FOR JUDGMENT

In English practice,
a proceeding whereby a party to an action moves
for the judgment of the court in his favor. S.Ct.
Rules 1883, ord. 40.

## MOTION IN ARREST OF JUDGMENT

It is in-
tended to avoid judgment because of unamendable
defect appearing on record. Turner v. Shackle-
ford, 43 Ga.App. 271, 158 S.E. 439, 440.

## MOTION IN ERROR

A motion in error stands
on the same footing as a writ of error; the only
difference is that, on a motion in error, no service
is required to be made on the opposite party, be-
cause, being before the court when the motion is
filed, he is bound to take notice of it at his peril.
Treadway v. Coe, 21 Conn. 283.

## MOTION TO SET ASIDE JUDGMENT

This is a
step taken by a party ih an action who is dissatis-
fied with the judgment directed to be entered at
the trial of the action.

## MOTIVE

Cause or reason that moves the will
and induces action. Commonwealth v. Trunk, 311
Pa. 555, 167 A. 333, 338. An inducement, or that
which leads or tempts the mind to indulge a crim-
inal act. People v. Lewis, 275 N.Y. 33, 9 N.E.2d
765, 768.
In the popular mind intent and "motive" are not in-
frequently regarded as one and the same thing. In law
there is a clear distinction between them. "Motive" is the
moving power which impels to action for a definite result.
Intent is the purpose to use a particular means to effect
such result. "Motive" is that which incites or stimulates
a person to do an act. People v. Weiss, 252 App.Div. 463,
300 N.Y.S. 249, 255.

## MOTOR VEHICLE

In the Uniform Act Regulat-
ing Traffic on Highways, 11 U.L.A., and similar
statutes, any self-propelled "vehicle," defined as
including every device in, upon, or by which any
person or property is or may be transported or
drawn upon a highway, except devices moved by
human or muscular power or used exclusively up-
on stationary rails or tracks. The term "motor
vehicles," although sometimes regarded as synony-
a broader meaning, and includes not only ordinary •
automobiles, but also motorbusses and trucks, as
well as motorcycles. Blashfield, Cyc. of Automo-
bile Law and Prac., Perm. Ed., § 2.
Motor vehicle insurance. See Insurance.

## MOTORCYCLE

A bicycle propelled by a gasoline
engine located in the frame between the wheels.
Ellett v. Klein, C.C.A.Pa., 252 F. 805, 806, certio-
rari denied Harley-Davidson Motor Co. v. Ellett,
39 S.Ct. 8, 248 U.S. 563, 63 L.Ed. 423; Bonds v.
State, 16 Ga.App. 401, 85 S.E. 629, 630.
A motorcycle is not a "motor-driven car" as that term
is used in insurance policies. Generally, however, a motor-
cycle is included in the term "motor vehicle," although
under some statutes the words "automobile" and "motor-
cycle" are separately defined and the regulations and lia-
bilities with respect thereto differ in material ways.
Blashfleld, Cyc. of Automobile Law and Prac., Perm. Ed.,
§2.

## MOTU PROPRIO

par. 931, Rev.Code 1928, § 742.

## MOVABLE

as movable property; or in time, as movable feasts
or terms of court. Goddard v. Winchell, 86 Iowa
71, 52 N.W. 1124, 17 L.R.A. 788.

## MOVABLE ESTATE

A term equivalent to "per-
sonal estate" or "personal property." Den v.
Sayre, 3 N.J.L. 187.

## MOVABLE FREEHOLD

A term applied by Lord
Coke to real property which is capable of being in-
creased or diminished by natural causes; as where
the owner of seashore acquires or loses land as the
waters recede or approach. Holman v. Hodges, 112
Iowa 714, 84 N.W. 950, 58 L.R.A. 673.

## MOVABLES

Things movable; movable or per-
sonal chattels which may be annexed to or attend-
ant on the person of the owner, and carried about
with him from one part of the world to another.
2 Bl.Comm. 387.
Movables consist—First, of inanimate things, as goods,
plate, money, jewels, implements of war, garments, and
the like or vegetable productions, as the fruit or other
parts of a plant when severed from the body of it or the
whole plant itself when severed from the ground; second-
ly, of animals, which have in themselves a principle and
power of motion. 2 Steph.Comm. 67.
possession, or which are in the power of the owner, as a
horse in actual use, a piece of furniture in a man's own
house; and such as are in the possession of another, and
can only be recovered by action, which are therefore said
to be in action, as a debt.
But it has been held that movable property, in a legacy,
strictly includes only such as is corporeal and tangible;
not, therefore, rights in action, as judgment or bond
debts; Strong v. White, 19 Conn. 238, 245; 1 Wm. Jones
225; but see Penniman v. French, 17 Pick., Mass., 404, 28
Am.Dec. 309; and that, in a will, "movables" is used in
its largest sense, but will not pass growing crops, nor
building materials on ground; Jackson v. Vanderspreigle,
2 Dall. 142, 1 L.Ed. 323.
Civil law. Movables (mobilia,) properly denoted
inanimate things; animals being distinguished as
moventia, things moving. Calvin. But these
words mobilia and moventia are also used synony-
mously, and in the general sense of "movables."
Id.
Scotch law. "Movables" are opposed to "heri-
tage." So that every species of property, and
every right a man can hold, is by that law either
heritable or movable. Bell.

motion before a count; the applicant for a rule or
order.

## MOVE OUT

To vacate; to yield up possession.
Polich v. Severson, 68 Mont. 225, 216 R 785, 787.

## MOVEMENT

In relating to train, the word
"movement" was not restricted to actual revolu-
tion of wheels of train or locomotive engaged in
interstate commerce, but could apply to a train
tied up on a siding. Great Northern Ry. Co. v.
United States, C.C.A.Idaho, 211 F. 309, 312. Simi-
larly, as regards vehicles, the term could compre-
hend the control and management of vehicles,
including power to require that motor be closed
down when a motor vehicle was left on street.

forated baffles for a locomotive pop safety valve.

ster, Dict. See, also, Mustizo.
Properly a mulatto is a person one of whose parents is
wholly black and the other wholly white ; but the word
does not always, though perhaps it does generally, re-
quire so exactly even a mixture of blood, nor is its
signification alike in all the states. 1 Bish.Mar. & D. § 308.

## MULCT

A penalty or punishment imposed on a
person guilty of some offense, tort, or misdemean-

if the reading of old authors was familiar to us.
MULTA IN JURE COMMUNI CONTRA RA-
TIONEM DISPUTANDI, PRO COMMUNI UTIL-
ITATE INTRODUCTA SUNT. Many things have
been introduced into the common law, with a view

mand of several matters of a distinct and independent na-
ture against several defendants, in the same bill. Stork,
Eq.P1. § 271; Essen v. Adams, 342 Mo. 1196, 119 S.W.2d
773, 777, 118 A.L.R. 1393.
"Multifariousness" as to matter consists in uniting in
the same bill distinct and disconnected subjects, matters,
or causes, and "multifariousness" as to parties consists in
joining in same suit parties who are without a common in-
terest in subject of litigation and have no connection with
each other. Essen v. Adams, 342 Mo. 1196, 119 S.W.2d 773,
777, 118 A.L.R. 1393.
The joining of distinct and independent matters, each of
which would constitute a cause of action. Otto F. Stifel's
Union Brewing Co. v. Weber, 194 Mo.App. 605, 186 S.W.
1119, 1122; Johnson v. Benbow, 93 Fla. 124, 111 So. 504,
"Multifariousness" abstractly is incapable of an accurate
definition, but includes those cases where a party is
brought as a defendant on a record with a large portion
of which, and, in the case made by which, he has no con-
nection whatever. Stamey v. Fortner; 230 Ala. 204, 160
So. 116.
The vice of multifariousness is the union of causes of ac-
tion which, or of parties whose .claims, it is either im-
practical or inconvenient to adjudicate in a single suit.
Where it is as practical and convenient for court and par-
ties to deal with the claims, and parties joined, in one suit
as in many, there is no multifariousness. Westinghouse
Air Brake Co. v. R. Co., C.C.A.Mo., 71 C.C.A. 1, 137 F. 26;
Schell v. Leander Clark College, C.C.A.Iowa, 2 F.2d 17, 21.
And it is not essential that every defendant have an inter-
est in or concern for all matters or phases of the contro-
versy. Mitchell v. Cudd, 196 Ala. 162, 71 So. 660; Norfolk
Southern R. Co. v. Stricklin, D.C.N.C., 264 F. 546, 555.
A bill is not multifarious which seeks alternative or in-
consistent relief growing out of the same subject-matter
or founded on the same contract or transaction, or relating
to the same property between the same parties. Code Ala.
§ 3095, Code 1923, § 6526; Szabo v. Speckman, 73 Fla. 374,
74 So. 411, 412, L.R.A. 1917D, 357.
Legislation. The joining, in a single legislative
act, of dissimilar and discordant subjects, which,
by no fair intendment, can be considered as having
a legitimate connection or relation to the subject
of the act. Boise City v. Baxter, 41 Idaho 368, 238
P. 1029, 1033.

## MULTIPLE POINDING

In Scotch law, double
distress; a name given to an action, corresponding
to proceedings by way of interpleader, which may

settle their claims, so that the party who sues may
be liable only "in once and single payment." Bell.

385; Williams v. Millington, 1. H.B1. 81.

## MULTITUDE

An assemblage of many people.
According to Coke it is not a word of very pre-
cise meaning; for some authorities hold that there
must be at least ten persons to make a multitude,
while others maintain that no definite number is
fixed by law. Co.Litt. 257. Two cannot consti-
tute a multitude. Pike v. Witt, 104 Mass. 595.
Three or more constitute. State v. Earp, '196 N.C.
164, 145 S.E. 23, 25.

## MULTITUDINEM DECEM FACIUNT

Co.Litt.
257. Ten make a multitude.

## MULTITUDO ERRANTIUM NON PARIT ER- RORI PATROCINUM

The multitude of those
who err furnishes no countenance or excuse for
error. 11 Coke, 75a. It is no excuse for error

a court. 2 Inst. 219.

## MULTO

In old records, a wether sheep.
MULTO UTILIUS EST PAUCA IDONEA EF-

## MUNERA

In the early ages of the feudal law,
the name given to the grants of land made by a
king or chieftain to his followers, which were held

lord. Afterwards they became life-estates, and
then hereditary, and were called first "benefices,"
and then "feuds." See Wright, Ten. 19.

## MUNICEPS

Lat. In Roman Law, eligible to of-
fice. A provincial person; a countryman. This
was the designation of one born in the provinces
or in a city politically connected with Rome, who
had come to Rome, and though a Roman citizen,
yet was looked down upon as a provincial, and
not allowed to hold the higher offices.
In the provinces the term seems to have been
applied to the freemen of any city who were eligi-
ble to the municipal offices. Calvin.

## MUNICIPAL

In narrower sense, it means per-
taining to a local governmental unit, commonly, a
city or town or other governmental unit. In its
broader sense, it means pertaining to the public
or governmental affairs of a state or nation or of
a people. Chadwick v. City of Crawfordsville, 216
Ind. 399, 24 N.E.2d 937, 941, 942, 129 A.L.R. 469.

considered as an entity independent of other
states or nations. Hammel v. Little, 66 App.D.C.

Among the Romans, cities were called municipia; these
cities voluntarily joined the Roman republic in relation to
their sovereignty only, retaining their laws, their liberties,
and their magistrates, who were thence called municipal
magistrates. With us this word has a more extensive
meaning : for example, we call municipal law not the law
of a city only, but the law of the state. 1 Bla.Comm. 44.

## MUNICIPAL ACTION

Exercise of governmental
power by a municipality. Orme v. Atlas Gas &
Oil Co., 217 Minn. 27, 13 N.W.2d 757, 761.

## MUNICIPAL AFFAIRS

energy, and the establishment and operation of transpor-
tation service, which were once regarded as being of a
strictly private nature. In re Bonds of Orosi Public Utili-

taken by private parties, but likely to be of bene-
fit to the municipality; e. g., a railroad.

utes contemplating the consent of such authori-
ties, the term means the consent by the legisla-
tive authorities of the city acting by ordinance;
Holland Realty & Power Co. v. City of St. Louis,
282 Mo. 180, 221 S.W. 51, 53, for example, in a
town, the members of the town board; Farnsworth
v. Boro Oil & Gas Co., 216 N.Y. 40, 109 N.E. 860.

## MUNICIPAL BONDS

ration, created by government for political pur-
poses, and having subordinate and local powers
of legislation. 2 Kent, Comm. 275; Bonaparte v,
Camden & A. R. Co., Baldw. 222, F.Cas.No.1617.
An incorporation of persons, inhabitants of a
particular place, or connected with a particular
district, enabling them to conduct its local civil

thority of subordinate self-government and improvement
and local administration of affairs of state. State v.

Div. 708, 189 N.Y.S. 119, 122; but see contra, as to the Dis-
trict of Columbia, Stoutenburgh v. Hennick, 129 U.S. 141,
9 S.Ct. 256, 32 L.Ed. 637. Nevertheless, it has been held in
other cases, often under different circumstances or in dif-
ferent contexts, that the term may include counties; Van

authority from "incorporating" charters granted
by the crown. Wharton.
Quasi municipal corporations. Bodies politic
and corporate, created for the sole purpose of

Woodward v. Livermore Falls Water Dist., 116 Me.
86, 100 A. 317, 319, L.R.A.1917D, 678.
Public corporations organized for governmental pur-
poses and having for most purposes the status and powers
of municipal corporations (such as counties, townships,
school districts, drainage districts, irrigation districts,
etc.), but not municipal corporations proper, such as
cities and incorporated towns. Snider v. St. Paul, 51 Minn.
466, 53 N.W. 763, 18 L.R.A. 151; Plumbing Supply Co. v.
Board of Education of Independent School Dist. of City

Community Consol. School Dist. No. 76, 312 Ill. 376, 144
N.E. 13, 16.

## MUNICIPAL CORPORATION DE FACTO

One
which exists when there is (1) some law under
which a corporation with the powers assumed
might lawfully have been created; (2) a colorable
and bona fide attempt to perfect an organization
under such a law; (3) user of the rights claimed
to have been conferred by the law. Evens v. An-
derson, 132 Minn. 59, 155 N.W. 1040, 1041.

## MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONS ACT

In English
law, a general statute, (5 & 6 Wm. IV. c. 76,) pass-
ed in 1835, prescribing general regulations for the
incorporation and government of boroughs.

## MUNICIPAL COURTS

In the judicial organiza-
tion of several states, courts are established un-
fined to the city or community in which they are
erected. Such courts usually have a criminal ju-
risdiction corresponding to that of a police court,
and, in some cases, possess civil jurisdiction in
small causes. Ex parte Gownlock, 13 Okl.Cr. 293,
164 P. 130, 131.

## MUNICIPAL DOMICILE

Sometimes used in
contradistinction to "national domicile" and "qua-
si national domicile" to refer to residence in a
county, township, or municipality; called also
"domestic domicile." Hayward v. Hayward, 65
Ind.App. 440, 115 N.E. 966, 970.

## MUNICIPAL ELECTION

pal officers are chosen. Hutchins v. City of Des
Moines, 176 Iowa, 189, 157 N.W. 881, 883. Compare

## MUNICIPAL FUNCTION

One created or grant-
ed for the special benefit and advantage of the
urban community embraced within the corporate
boundaries. State ex rel. Gebhardt v. City Coun-
cil of Helena, 102 Mont. 27, 55 P.2d 671, 673.
Sometimes called a private function, as distinguished
from a public or governmental function, which is one con-
ferred or imposed on the municipality as a local agency of
limited and prescribed jurisdiction to be employed in ad-
ministering the affairs of the state, and promoting the
public welfare generally. Bryan v. City of West Palm
Beach, 75 Fla. 19, 77 So. 627; Griffith v. City of Butte, 72
Mont. 552, 234 P. 829, 831.
Logically all those are strictly municipal functions which
specially and peculiarly promote the comfort, convenience,
safety and happiness of the citizens of the municipality,
rather than the welfare of the general public. Under this
class of functions are included, in most jurisdictions, the
proper care of streets and alleys, parks and other public
places, and the erection and maintenance of public utilities
and improvements generally. Chardkoff Junk Co. v. City
of Tampa, 102 Fla. 501, 135 So. 457, 459.

tices, 229 Mass. 601, 119 N.E. 778, 781.

an individual state or nation. It is the rule or law by
which a particular district, community, or nation is gov-
erned. 1 Bl.Comm. 44. That which pertains solely to the
citizens and inhabitants of a state, and is thus distin-
guished from political law, commercial law, and the law
of nations. Wharton; City of Louisville v. Babb, C.C.A.
Ind., 75 F.2d 162, 165. In its more modern and narrower
connotation it means those laws which pertain to towns,
cities and villages and their local government. People ex
rel. Ray v. Martin, 294 N.Y. 61, 60 N.E.2d 541, 547; 548.

often bears a special .or limited sense, in which
it may not apply even to members of the city
council. Lambert v. Barrett, 115 Va. 136, 78 S.E.
586, 587, Ann.Cas.1914D, 1226.

a regulation under a delegation of power from
the state. Harris v. City of Des Moines, 202 Iowa
53, 209 N.W. 454, 456, 46 A.L.R. 1429.

al purposes as distinguished from private pur-
poses; Georgia Ry. & Power Co. v. City of Atlan-
ta, 154 Ga. 731, 115 S.E. 263, 271. It may compre-
hend all activities essential to the health, morals,
protection, and welfare of the municipality. State

York, 87 Misc. 120, 150 N.Y.S. 382, 385.

debtedness issued by cities, towns, counties, town-
ships, school-districts, and other such territorial

## MURDER

express or implied. State v. Hutter, 145 Neb. 798,
18 N.W.2d 203, 206.
The crime committed where a person of sound mind and
discretion (that is, of sufficient age to form and execute a
criminal design and not legally "insane") kills any human
creature in being (excluding quick but unborn children)
and in the peace of the state or nation (including all per-
sons except the military forces of the public enemy in time
cuse in law. with malice aforethought, express or implied,
that is, with a deliberate purpose or a design or determi-
nation distinctly formed in the mind before the commis-
sion of the act, provided generally that death results from
the injury inflicted within one year and a day after its
infliction. Kilpatrick v. Com., 31 Pa. 198; Hotema v. U.

State, 117 Ala. 1, 23 So. 671, 67 Am.St.Rep. 157.
The term implies a felonious homicide, while the word
"kill" does not necessarily mean any more than to deprive
of life, as a man may kill another by accident, or in self-
defense, and in many other ways, without the imputation
of crime. Pilcher v. State, 16 Ala.App. 237, 77 So. 75, 76.
For the distinction between murder and manslaughter
and other forms of homicide, see Homicide; Manslaughter.
Statutory Definitions. Murder is the unlawful killing of
a human being with malice aforethought. Pen.Code Cal.
§ 187; Arizona Code Ann.1939, § 43-2901, Pen.Code Ariz.

aforethought, either express or implied, is guilty of mur-
der. I.C.A. § 690.1. Murder is the unlawful killing of a

The killing of a human being, without the authority of
law, by any means, or in any manner shall be murder in
the following cases : When done with deliberate design to
effect the death of the person killed, or of any human be-
ing ; when done in the commission of an act eminently
dangerous to others, and evincing a depraved heart, re-
gardless of human life, although without any premeditated
design to effect the death of any particular individual;
when done without any design to effect death, by any
person engaged in the commission of the crime of rape,
burglary, arson, or robbery, or in any attempt to commit
such felonies. Mississippi Code 1942 § 2215. Every homi-
cide, perpetrated by poison, lying in wait, or any other
kind of willful, deliberate, malicious, and premeditated
killing; or committed in the perpetration of, or the at-
tempt to perpetrate, any arson, rape, robbery, or burglary;
or perpetrated from a premeditated design unlawfully and
maliciously to effect the death of any human being other
than him who is killed; or perpetrated by any act greatly
dangerous to the lives of others, and evidencing a depraved
mind, regardless of human life, although without any pre-
conceived purpose to deprive any particular person of life,
is murder in the first degree; and every other homicide,
committed under such circumstances as would have con-
stituted murder at common law, is murder in the second
degree. Code Ala. 1940, § 314. Murder is the unlawful
killing of a human being, in the peace of the people, with
malice aforethought, either expressed or implied. The
unlawful killing may be perpetrated by poisoning, strik-
ing, starving, drowning, stabbing, shooting, or by any

ture may be overcome, and death thereby occasioned.
S.H.A. ch. 38, § 358.
Common-Law. The willful killing of any subject what-
ever, with malice aforethought, whether the person slain
shall be an Englishman or a foreigner. Hawk. P.C. b. 1,
c. 13, § 3. The killing of any person under the king's

Inst. 47; State v. Robinson, 143 La. 543, 78 So. 933, 935.
Degrees. These were unknown at common law, but have
been introduced in many states by statutes, the terms of
which are too variant to be here discussed in detail. In
general, however, it may be said that most states only
divide the crime into "murder in the first degree" and
"murder in the second degree," though in some there are
three degrees; and that the general purport of these stat-
utes is to confine murder in the first degree to homicide
committed by poison, lying in wait, and other killings com-
mitted in pursuance of a deliberate and premeditated de-
sign, and to those which accompany the commission of
some of the more atrocious felonies, such as burglary, ar-
son, rape, and robbery; while murder in the second de-
gree occurs where there is no such deliberately formed
design to take life or to perpetrate one of the enumerated
nevertheless, there was a purpose to kill (or at least a
purpose to inflict the particular injury without caring
whether it caused death or not) formed instantaneously in
the mind, and where the killing was without justification
or excuse, and without any such provocation as would re-
duce the crime to the grade of manslaughter. State v.
Nelson, 148 Minn. 285, 181 N.W. 850, 851; State v. Liolios,
285 Mo. 1, 225 S.W. 941, 947; Commonwealth v. Divomte,
262 Pa. 504, 105 A. 821, 822. In a few states, there is a
crime of "murder in the third degree," which is defined as
the killing of a human being without any design to effect
death by a person who is engaged in the commission of a
felony. Tillman v. State, 81 Fla. 558, 88 So. 377, 378.

## MURDRUM

In old English law, the killing of a
man in a secret manner.
When a man was thus killed, and he was unknown, by
the laws of Canute he was presumed to be a Dane, and

his death. After the conquest, a similar law was made in
favor of Normans, which was abolished by 3 Edw. III.
