Notes about transcript: These transcripts are auto generated, so its possible that there could be some inaccuracies in the transcription.  Also, the speaker, Brandon Joe Williams, uses alot of swear words, so it looks like the auto transcript blocks them out.  As for interpreting Brandon Joe Williams speaking style, please keep in mind that he:

1. Can use alot of swear words, but they are more meant to be just a form of expression, and not taken literally.  

2. Can occasionally use some sarcasm

Additional notes about this transcript.  From my view, it is overall about a "man" or "woman" being able to healthfully and properly establish healthy and correct relationships with the law and legal world around them.  This is done by more accurately understanding the current agreements (aka, contracts) that people have knowingly or unknowingly gotten theirself into.  From there, people can then do several things:

1. correct their relationship in a way that actually benefits them and reflects the truth of the situation (e.g. they dont want to be in unhealthy agreements that are one sided, or agreements that could harm theirself)

2. create new agreements (aka. contracts) which properly integrate with other agreement frameworks.
