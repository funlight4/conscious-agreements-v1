# Independent Analysis: The Slaughterhouse Cases (1873)
## 83 U.S. 36 - A Close Reading with Brandon Joe Williams' Key References

---

## Case Overview

### The Basic Facts
- Louisiana passed a law in 1869 creating a monopoly for one slaughterhouse company in New Orleans area
- The monopoly covered 1,154 square miles and affected 200,000-300,000 people
- About 1,000 butchers were forced to use this single company's facilities and pay fees
- The butchers sued, claiming violations of the 13th and 14th Amendments

### The Core Question
Can a state grant exclusive monopoly privileges that prevent citizens from pursuing their lawful trade independently?

---

## The Majority Opinion (Justice Miller)

### Key Finding on Two Citizenships

**Critical Passage** (exactly what Brandon references):
> "It is quite clear, then, that there is a citizenship of the United States, and a citizenship of a State, which are distinct from each other, and which depend upon different characteristics or circumstances in the individual."

**The Distinction Explained**:
> "Not only may a man be a citizen of the United States without being a citizen of a State, but an important element is necessary to convert the former into the latter. He must reside within the State to make him a citizen of it, but it is only necessary that he should be born or naturalized in the United States to be a citizen of the Union."

### What Rights Belong to Each Citizenship?

**Federal Citizenship Rights (very limited)**:
The Court said federal citizenship only protects:
- Right to come to the seat of government
- Right to access seaports
- Right to protection when abroad
- Right to use navigable waters
- Rights secured by treaties
- Right to become a citizen of any state by residing there

**State Citizenship Rights (most rights)**:
> "the entire domain of the privileges and immunities of citizens of the States, as above defined, lay within the constitutional and legislative power of the States, and without that of the Federal government."

### The Court's Shocking Admission

The Court essentially admits the 14th Amendment would be meaningless under their interpretation:
> "If this inhibition has no reference to privileges and immunities of this character, but only refers, as held by the majority of the court in their opinion, to such privileges and immunities as were before its adoption specially designated in the Constitution or necessarily implied as belonging to citizens of the United States, it was a vain and idle enactment, which accomplished nothing"

(This is from Field's dissent, but accurately describes the majority's position)

## Justice Field's Powerful Dissent

### On Natural Rights vs. Granted Privileges

Field argues the Louisiana law violates fundamental rights:
> "The question presented is, therefore, one of the gravest importance, not merely to the parties here, but to the whole country. It is nothing less than the question whether the recent amendments to the Federal Constitution protect the citizens of the United States against the deprivation of their common rights by State legislation."

### The Right to Pursue a Lawful Calling

**Key Quote Brandon Would Reference**:
> "Clearly among these must be placed the right to pursue a lawful employment in a lawful manner, without other restraint than such as equally affects all persons."

### On Monopolies Being Void at Common Law

Field references the English common law that Brandon cites:
> "All monopolies in any known trade or manufacture are an invasion of these privileges, for they encroach upon the liberty of citizens to acquire property and pursue happiness, and were held void at common law in the great Case of Monopolies, decided during the reign of Queen Elizabeth."

### Definition of Monopoly (Important for Brandon's Framework)

> "A monopoly is defined 'to be an institution or allowance from the sovereign power of the State by grant, commission, or otherwise, to any person or corporation, for the sole buying, selling, making, working, or using of anything, whereby any person or persons, bodies politic or corporate, are sought to be restrained of any freedom or liberty they had before, or hindered in their lawful trade.'"

## Critical Passages for Brandon's System

### 1. The 14th Amendment's Purpose (Majority View)

> "Before its enactment there was much diversity of opinion among jurists and statesmen whether there was any such citizenship independent of that of the State, and, if any existed, as to the manner in which it originated."

The Court admits there was major disagreement about whether US citizenship even existed separately from state citizenship.

### 2. The Calhoun Position (Referenced in Dissent)

> "If by citizen of the United States he means a citizen at large, one whose citizenship extends to the entire geographical limits of the country without having a local citizenship in some State or Territory, a sort of citizen of the world, all I have to say is that such a citizen would be a perfect nondescript; that not a single individual of this description can be found in the entire mass of our population."

This supports Brandon's view that originally, you were ONLY a citizen of your state, not of the "United States" as a whole.

### 3. The Privileges or Immunities Clause Neutered

**What the Clause Says**:
> "No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States"

**How the Court Destroyed It**:
> "It is a little remarkable, if this clause was intended as a protection to the citizen of a State against the legislative power of his own State, that the word citizen of the State should be left out when it is so carefully used, and used in contradistinction to citizens of the United States, in the very sentence which precedes it."

### 4. The Police Power Justification

The Court upheld the monopoly as valid "police power":
> "This power is, and must be from its very nature, incapable of any very exact definition or limitation. Upon it depends the security of social order, the life and health of the citizen, the comfort of an existence in a thickly populated community"

## Brandon's Key Takeaways from This Case

### 1. **Two Separate Citizenships Confirmed**
- State citizenship = primary, with full rights
- US citizenship = secondary, limited federal rights only
- Location: Throughout opinion, especially middle sections

### 2. **State Citizens Had Rights Before the 14th Amendment**
The Court admits state citizens already had rights that didn't come from federal government:
> "Was it the purpose of the fourteenth amendment, by the simple declaration that no State should make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States, to transfer the security and protection of all the civil rights which we have mentioned, from the States to the Federal government?"

### 3. **The 14th Amendment Created Federal Citizenship**
> "The first clause of the fourteenth amendment changes this whole subject, and removes it from the region of discussion and doubt. It recognizes in express terms, if it does not create, citizens of the United States"

### 4. **Rights Come from States, Not Federal Government**
> "they are not intended to have any additional protection by this paragraph of the amendment... If, then, there is a difference between the privileges and immunities belonging to a citizen of the United States as such, and those belonging to the citizen of the State as such the latter must rest for their security and protection where they have heretofore rested"

### 5. **The Common Law Still Matters**
Field's dissent emphasizes that monopolies were void at common law - Brandon uses this to argue that many modern "requirements" (licenses, permits) are actually unlawful monopolies.

## My Independent Observations

### What's Remarkable About This Case

1. **The Court Admits Its Interpretation Makes the Amendment Pointless**
They essentially acknowledge that their reading makes the 14th Amendment do nothing new, yet they stick with it anyway.

2. **The Dissent Predicts Tyranny**
Field warns that if states can create monopolies for butchering, they can create them for anything:
> "If exclusive privileges of this character can be granted to a corporation of seventeen persons, they may, in the discretion of the legislature, be equally granted to single individual. If they may be granted for twenty-five years they may be equally granted for a century, and in perpetuity."

3. **The African American Context**
The majority admits the amendments were primarily about protecting freed slaves, but then interprets them so narrowly that they provide almost no protection to anyone.

### How Brandon Uses This Case

Brandon appears to use the Slaughterhouse Cases to argue:

1. **You Can Choose Your Citizenship Status**
Since the court recognizes two distinct citizenships, Brandon argues you can be a state citizen without being a federal citizen.

2. **Federal Citizenship is a Trap**
The limited rights of federal citizenship compared to state citizenship makes federal citizenship actually disadvantageous.

3. **Most "Requirements" Are Actually Privileges**
If monopolies are against common law, then exclusive licenses (driver's licenses, professional licenses) might be void.

4. **The 14th Amendment Never Properly Integrated**
The Court's own admission that their interpretation makes it "vain and idle" suggests the amendment isn't functioning as intended.

## Critical Quotations for Brandon's Framework

### On Involuntary Servitude (from Field's Dissent)
> "The compulsion which would force him to labor even for his own benefit only in one direction, or in one place, would be almost as oppressive and nearly as great an invasion of his liberty as the compulsion which would force him to labor for the benefit or pleasure of another, and would equally constitute an element of servitude."

### On Natural Rights
> "The fundamental rights, privileges, and immunities which belong to him as a free man and a free citizen, now belong to him as a citizen of the United States, and are not dependent upon his citizenship of any State."

### On the Power of States vs. Federal Government
> "Under the pressure of all the excited feeling growing out of the war, our statesmen have still believed that the existence of the State with powers for domestic and local government, including the regulation of civil rights—the rights of person and of property—was essential to the perfect working of our complex form of government"

## The Hidden Implications

### What the Court Doesn't Say Explicitly

1. **Consent to Federal Citizenship**
If the two citizenships are separate, did people consent to federal citizenship? The Court doesn't address this.

2. **Can You Reject Federal Citizenship?**
If state citizenship is primary and existed first, can you have one without the other? The Court doesn't say you can't.

3. **What About Non-14th Amendment Citizens?**
People who were already state citizens before the 14th Amendment - did they automatically become federal citizens? The Court is unclear.

### The Pandora's Box

The Court opened a door that Brandon walks through:
- If rights come from states, not federal government
- If the two citizenships are separate
- If the 14th Amendment only protects federal rights (which are minimal)
- Then why would anyone want federal citizenship?

## Conclusion: Why This Case Matters to Brandon's System

The Slaughterhouse Cases provide Brandon with:

1. **Supreme Court Authority** for the two-citizenship distinction
2. **Historical Evidence** that state citizenship was primary
3. **Legal Precedent** that most rights come from states, not federal government
4. **Common Law Basis** for challenging monopolies and exclusive privileges
5. **Judicial Admission** that the 14th Amendment, as interpreted, does almost nothing

The irony is that the Court, in trying to limit the 14th Amendment's reach, created the very legal framework Brandon uses to argue for opting out of federal citizenship entirely. They confirmed the distinction between citizenships while admitting federal citizenship provides minimal benefits - exactly Brandon's point.

The dissent provides even more ammunition, arguing that monopolies and restrictions on pursuing lawful trades are fundamental violations of freedom - which Brandon extends to all licensing schemes.

This case is the cornerstone of Brandon's legal theory because it's the Supreme Court itself saying that:
- The two citizenships are different
- Federal citizenship has limited value
- States retain most power over rights
- The 14th Amendment didn't really change much

All of which supports his argument that remaining solely a state citizen might be preferable to accepting federal citizenship with all its obligations but few benefits.
