# FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLES

## PRINCIPLE 1: CHOICE CANNOT BE BROKEN

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                                 │
│                          CHOICE                                 │
│                                                                 │
│         The sovereign exercise of will by a living being        │
│                                                                 │
│                   THIS CANNOT BE BROKEN                         │
│                                                                 │
│   The only way it appears broken is if you choose to forget.   │
│   But forgetting is a choice - undone instantly by remembering.│
│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## PRINCIPLE 2: INHERITANCE RULE

**Every nested agreement inherits and cannot violate the terms of its encompassing agreement(s).**

Like a building needs a foundation, every agreement rests upon those that contain it. This cascades through all levels.

*(See Glossary: Nested, Inheritance, Encompassing)*

---

## PRINCIPLE 3: PURPOSE REQUIREMENT

**Every agreement has a PURPOSE.**

- Purpose may be explicit, implicit, hidden, or forgotten
- If you don't know the purpose, you don't understand the agreement
- Purpose determines positioning in hierarchy
- Always ask: "What is the PURPOSE of this agreement?"

*(See Perspective 8: Purpose)*

---

## PRINCIPLE 4: RELATIVE MEANING

**All meaning is relative to context. Context is defined by agreement.**

- There is no absolute "private" or "public" - only relative positioning
- Words mean what the AGREEMENT defines them to mean
- Same word in different agreements = different meanings
- Know your agreement = Know your meaning

*(See Relative Meaning Framework v1.0; Perspective 7)*

---

## PRINCIPLE 5: TEMPLATES AT EVERY LEVEL

**Higher level agreements function as templates for lower levels.**

- A template has DEFINED (fixed) elements and VARIABLE (open) elements
- Higher levels fill some variables, leave others open
- Lower levels inherit fixed elements and fill remaining variables
- This pattern repeats at every level of nesting

*(See Glossary: Template, Defined Elements, Variable Elements)*

---

## PRINCIPLE 6: POWER DYNAMICS

**Every agreement involves power. The question is HOW power is structured.**

- **Power-With:** Cooperative, mutual, life-enhancing
- **Power-Over:** Dominating, extractive, life-diminishing
- This distinction applies at ALL levels
- Covert contracts are ALWAYS Power-Over

*(See Perspective 9: Power Dynamics)*

---

## PRINCIPLE 7: THE KNOWN/UNKNOWN JOURNEY

**Consciousness evolves by encountering the unknown and integrating it into the known.**

- Unconscious agreements are not failures - they are growth edges
- The journey is continuous; mastery is comfort with the process
- All beings are somewhere on this journey

*(See Perspective 10: Known/Unknown Journey)*

# AGREEMENT AWARENESS SPECTRUM

Agreements exist on a spectrum of awareness:

```
CONSCIOUS ◄─────────────────────────────────────────► UNCONSCIOUS

Fully         Mostly        Partially      Mostly         Fully
Aware         Aware         Aware          Unaware        Unaware
│             │             │              │              │
Chosen        Known but     Some terms     Entered        No idea
deliberately  not examined  unclear        unknowingly    you're in it
```

## Conscious Agreements

Agreements where you:
- Know you're in them
- Understand the terms (mostly)
- Chose to enter (or consciously remain)
- Know how to exit

**Can be:** Power-With OR Power-Over (at least you know)

## Unconscious Agreements

Agreements where you:
- Don't know you're in them, OR
- Don't understand the real terms, OR
- Didn't consciously choose to enter, OR
- Don't know you can exit

**Types of Unconscious Agreements:**

| Type | Description | Power Dynamic | Response |
|------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| **Growth-Neutral** | Unknown but not significant | Neutral | Examine when relevant |
| **Growth-Positive** | Beneficial patterns absorbed | Power-With | Appreciate when conscious |
| **Growth-Negative** | Exploitative, not yet recognized | Power-Over | Exit or transform |
| **Covert Contract** | Deliberately hidden to exploit | Always Power-Over | Recognize, exit, protect |

*(See Perspective 10 for full framework on consciousness journey)*

---

# AGREEMENT FORMATION MODALITIES

How agreements come into existence:

| Modality | Description | Typical Awareness |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Spoken** | Verbal agreement | Usually conscious |
| **Written** | Documented, signed | Usually conscious |
| **Implied** | Inferred from behavior/context | Often unconscious |
| **Inherited** | Born into | Unconscious (initially) |
| **Coerced** | Entered under duress | Varies |

# THE HIERARCHY

---

## LEVEL 0: CHOICE

```
CHOICE
│
│   The apex. The unbreakable foundation.
│   Every living being has this capacity.
│   It cannot be removed, only forgotten.
│
│   PURPOSE: To exercise sovereign will
│
└── [Leads to Agreement]
```

---

## LEVEL 1: AGREEMENT

```
CHOICE
│
└── AGREEMENT
    │
    │   The mechanism by which choice is clarified and manifested.
    │
    │   PURPOSE: To structure and manifest choice into form
    │
    ├── INTERNAL AGREEMENT (Within Self)
    │   └── [See Level 1A]
    │
    └── EXTERNAL AGREEMENT (With Others/World)
        └── [See Level 1B and below]
```

---

## LEVEL 1A: INTERNAL AGREEMENT

```
AGREEMENT
│
└── INTERNAL AGREEMENT
    │
    │   Agreements within yourself.
    │   These PRECEDE and DRIVE all external agreements.
    │   Your internal state creates your external reality.
    │
    │   PURPOSE: To align self with chosen direction
    │
    ├── BELIEFS
    │   └── Agreements about what is true
    │
    ├── COMMITMENTS
    │   └── Agreements about what you will do
    │
    ├── VALUES
    │   └── Agreements about what matters
    │
    ├── IDENTITY
    │   └── Agreements about who you are
    │
    └── INTENTIONS
        └── Agreements about what you aim to create
```

**Key Insight:** Before any external agreement can bind you, there is an internal agreement that permits it.

---

## LEVEL 1B: EXTERNAL AGREEMENT

```
AGREEMENT
│
└── EXTERNAL AGREEMENT
    │
    │   Agreements with others or with the world.
    │
    │   PURPOSE: To create shared reality with others

    │   └── [See Level 3]
    │
    └── NATION AGREEMENTS (Specific Nations)
        └── [See Level 4]
```

**Note on "Particular Agreements":** Agreements between specific parties (previously called "Private Agreements" or "Level 5") are not a hierarchical level but rather a **relative position**. Any agreement can be "particular" (between specific parties) at any level. The term "private" is relative - meaning "not within the referenced agreement context." 

*(See Perspective 7: Relative Meaning; Glossary: Private)*

# UNCONSCIOUS & COVERT AGREEMENTS

**This section is CRITICAL. Most binding agreements are entered unconsciously.**

*(See also: Perspective 10: Known/Unknown Journey)*

---

## Categories of Unconscious Agreements

### SYSTEMIC (Almost everyone is in these)

| Agreement | How Entered | Power Dynamic | Awareness |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|-----------|
| Birth Certificate | Parents signed | Mixed/Unknown | None (baby) |
| Social Security | Application signed | Power-Over? | Low |
| Citizenship | Born into | Mixed | Low |
| Using FRNs (USD) | Just using them | Power-Over | Very Low |
| Driver's License | Application signed | Mixed | Low |
| Voter Registration | Application signed | Mixed | Medium |
| Bank Account | Agreements signed | Power-Over | Low |

### INSTITUTIONAL

| Agreement | How Entered | Power Dynamic | Awareness |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|-----------|
| Terms of Service | Clicked "I agree" | Usually Power-Over | Very Low |
| Employment | Signed contract | Varies | Low-Medium |
| Medical Consent | Signed forms | Mixed | Low |
| Education Enrollment | Signed forms | Mixed | Low |
| Insurance Policies | Signed policy | Often Power-Over | Low |

### PERSONAL/RELATIONAL (Covert Contracts)

| Pattern | How Formed | Power Dynamic | Recognition |
|---------|------------|---------------|-------------|
| Narcissistic Relationship | Gradual manipulation | Power-Over | Often very low |
| Unspoken Expectations | Assumed, never stated | Can be either | Low |
| Family Patterns | Inherited from childhood | Can be either | Low |
| Cultural Assumptions | Absorbed from environment | Can be either | Very Low |
| Guilt/Obligation Contracts | Emotional manipulation | Power-Over | Low-Medium |

---

## Covert Contracts

**Definition:** Agreements with deliberately hidden terms, designed to exploit the unaware party.

**Characteristics:**
- **Always Power-Over** - by definition
- One or more parties don't know the full terms
- Benefits aware party at expense of unaware
- Uses confusion, shame, fear, or obligation
- Difficult to exit (or exit isn't visible)
- Questioning is punished

**Warning Signs:**
- You feel obligated but don't know why
- Terms seem to change without notice
- You're not allowed to question
- Exit feels impossible
- You feel diminished by the relationship
- "That's just how it is"

*(See Perspective 9 for full Power Dynamics analysis)*

## The Awakening Process

When an unconscious agreement becomes conscious:

```
UNCONSCIOUS AGREEMENT
        │
        ▼
   RECOGNITION
   "I'm in an agreement I didn't know about"
        │
        ▼
   INVESTIGATION
   "What are the actual terms?"
        │
        ▼
   EVALUATION
   "Does this serve me? Power-With or Power-Over?"
        │
        ▼
   CHOICE
   ├── CONTINUE (now consciously)
   ├── EXIT (if possible and desired)
   ├── RENEGOTIATE (if possible)
   └── TRANSFORM relationship to it
        │
        ▼
CONSCIOUS AGREEMENT (or no agreement)
   Now integrated into the Known
```

# RELATIVE POSITIONING: PRIVATE/PUBLIC

**"Private" and "Public" are not hierarchical levels - they are RELATIVE POSITIONS.**

| Term | Meaning | Relative To |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Private** | NOT within the referenced agreement | Specific agreement context |
| **Public** | Within/available to those in agreement | Specific agreement context |

**Example:**
- A trust is "private" relative to U.S. = not within U.S. jurisdiction
- Same trust is "public" relative to Erlandia = known/recognized in Erlandia
- Same trust is "particular" = between specific parties

**There is no absolute "private" - only relative positioning.**

*(See Perspective 7: Relative Meaning; Glossary: Private, Public)*

# THE TEN PERSPECTIVES

For full analysis, apply these perspectives:

| # | Perspective | Key Question |
|---|-------------|--------------|
| 1 | Structural/Nesting | What contains what? |
| 2 | Awareness/Consciousness | Do I know I'm in this? |
| 3 | Template Flow | How do variables fill? |
| 4 | Scope/Breadth | How broadly does it span? |
| 5 | Modality | How was it formed? |
| 6 | Health/Alignment | Does it serve all parties? |
| 7 | Relative Meaning | What does it mean from here? |
| 8 | Purpose | Why does it exist? |
| 9 | Power Dynamics | Power-With or Power-Over? |
| 10 | Known/Unknown Journey | Where am I in consciousness evolution? |
