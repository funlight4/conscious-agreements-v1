# WHY THIS MATTERS

**People are confused because they think meaning is absolute.**

They think:
- "Person" means the same thing everywhere
- "Money" is money is money
- "Private" means hidden from everyone
- "Law" applies to everyone the same way
- Words have fixed definitions

**Reality:**
- "Person" in Black's Law ≠ "person" at the dinner table
- "Money" (gold) ≠ "currency" (FRN) ≠ "credit"
- "Private" only means "not in THIS agreement"
- "Law" is specific to the agreement that created it
- Words mean what the AGREEMENT says they mean

**The confusion is the control mechanism.**

When you don't understand relative meaning, you can be:
- Manipulated by word games
- Trapped in agreements you don't recognize
- Held to definitions you didn't agree to
- Controlled by changing the context without notice

**Understanding relative meaning is FREEDOM.**

---

# THE STRUCTURE OF RELATIVE MEANING

## Three Components

Every meaning has three components:

```
MEANING = TERM + CONTEXT + OBSERVER

Where:
- TERM = The word, symbol, or concept
- CONTEXT = The agreement structure it's within
- OBSERVER = The perspective from which it's being viewed
```

Change any component, the meaning changes.

---

## Example: The Word "Person"

**TERM:** "Person"

| CONTEXT | MEANING |
|---------|---------|
| Common English | A human being |
| 26 USC 7701 | Includes individual, trust, estate, partnership, corporation |
| Black's Law (some definitions) | May or may not include the sovereign |
| Your kitchen | Someone standing there |
| Corporate law | Often means the corporation itself |

**Same term. Different contexts. Different meanings.**

Now add OBSERVER:

| OBSERVER | SEES "PERSON" AS |
|----------|------------------|
| IRS agent | A tax-liable entity (their context) |
| Common man | A human being (common context) |
| Sovereign researcher | A legal fiction distinct from man/woman |
| Corporation | Itself or other corporations |

**The IRS agent is not wrong within THEIR context.**
**The common man is not wrong within THEIR context.**
**They're using the same word with different meanings.**

The question is: **WHICH CONTEXT APPLIES TO THIS SITUATION?**

---

## Example: "Private"

**There is no absolute "private."**

| RELATIVE TO | "PRIVATE" MEANS |
|-------------|-----------------|
| U.S. jurisdiction | Not within U.S. agreement; outside their system |
| Erlandia | Not within Erlandian agreement |
| A specific contract | Not disclosed in that contract |
| Your family | Not shared with family |
| The public | Not publicly known |

**"Private trust" = A trust that is NOT within the referenced public system**

If you're referencing U.S. law, "private trust" means not within U.S. trust law.
If you're referencing Erlandia, that same trust might be "public" (known, recognized).

**"Private" and "Public" are RELATIVE POSITIONS, not absolute states.**

---

## Example: "Law"

| CONTEXT | "LAW" REFERS TO |
|---------|-----------------|
| United States | USC, CFR, state statutes, case law |
| Erlandia | Erlandian law |
| Canon Law | Catholic Church regulations |
| Natural Law | Principles inherent to existence |
| Your household | House rules |

**U.S. "law" does not automatically apply to someone in the Erlandian context.**
**Just as Erlandian "law" does not automatically apply in the U.S. context.**
**Just as your household "law" doesn't apply at your neighbor's house.**

Each agreement structure has its own "law" - the rules within that agreement.

# THE RELATIVITY FRAMEWORK

## Level 1: Term Identification

**Ask:** What term/concept are we dealing with?
- Get clear on the exact word or concept
- Don't assume you know what it means yet

## Level 2: Context Identification

**Ask:** What agreement context is being referenced?
- Who created this context?
- What are its boundaries?
- What are its internal definitions?

## Level 3: Observer Identification

**Ask:** From whose perspective is this being viewed?
- Where is the observer standing?
- What context is the observer in?
- What assumptions does the observer carry?

## Level 4: Meaning Determination

**Only now** can you determine meaning:
- The term's meaning within the identified context
- As seen from the identified observer position
- This is the RELATIVE meaning

## Level 5: Applicability Question

**Ask:** Does this context actually apply to me/this situation?
- Am I within this agreement?
- Did I consent to this context?
- Is this context being imposed or assumed?

---

# PRACTICAL APPLICATION

## When Someone Uses a Word

**Don't assume you know what they mean.**

Instead:
1. **Ask:** "What do you mean by [term]?"
2. **Ask:** "In what context?"
3. **Ask:** "According to whose definition?"

**Example dialogue:**

Them: "You're a person subject to this law."

You: "What do you mean by 'person' in this context?"
Them: "A person under the tax code."
You: "And which agreement establishes that I'm a 'person' under that code?"
Them: "..."

**The question exposes the assumption.**

---

## When Encountering a Document

**Identify the context first.**

Ask:
1. What agreement is this document within?
2. How does this document define its terms?
3. Does this agreement apply to me?
4. Did I enter this agreement?

**Example: Tax Form**

1. **Agreement:** U.S. tax code (26 USC)
2. **Definitions:** As defined in 26 USC 7701
3. **Applicability:** Only if you're a "taxpayer" as defined
4. **Entry:** Various mechanisms claimed by IRS

---

## When Making a Statement

**Be precise about your context.**

Specify:
1. What context you're speaking from
2. What definitions you're using
3. What your position is relative to other contexts

**Example:**

Instead of: "That's illegal!"
Say: "That's prohibited under U.S. federal law, which may or may not apply depending on jurisdictional agreements."

Instead of: "I'm a private person."
Say: "I am operating in a private capacity relative to [specific agreement], meaning I am not within that agreement's jurisdiction."

---

# CONTEXT SHIFTING

## What It Is

Context shifting is when the agreement context changes - either:
- **Explicitly** (clearly announced)
- **Implicitly** (assumed without announcement)
- **Covertly** (hidden, manipulative)

## The Danger

**Covert context shifting is a primary manipulation technique.**

Example:
1. You're having a casual conversation (common English context)
2. Someone asks you to sign something
3. Suddenly you're in a legal context (different definitions)
4. But no one told you the context shifted
5. Now words you used "casually" have legal implications

## The Defense

**Always ask:** "Has the context changed?"

Signs of context shift:
- Documents appear
- Formal language increases
- Someone is recording
- Official titles are used
- You're asked to sign or state something

When context shifts, **PAUSE** and:
1. Identify the new context
2. Understand the new definitions
3. Decide if you're entering this context
4. Reserve rights if entering

```

**The collective level has the universal/common meaning.**
**Each nation context adds or modifies for their system.**
**What "person" means depends on WHERE you're standing.**

---

# COMMON TRAPS

## Trap 1: Assuming Universal Meaning

**Trap:** Thinking a word means the same thing everywhere.

**Example:** Thinking "individual" means "a human being" when in tax context it may mean "sole proprietorship."

**Defense:** Always check definitions within the specific context.

---

## Trap 2: Accepting Imposed Context

**Trap:** Letting someone else put you in their context without agreement.

**Example:** IRS sends letter assuming you're a "taxpayer" - you respond as if you are, accepting their context.

**Defense:** Question whether their context applies before responding within it.

---

## Trap 3: Not Knowing Your Context

**Trap:** Not being clear what context YOU are operating from.

**Example:** You think you're in "private" but you've signed documents putting you in "public" U.S. jurisdiction.

**Defense:** Audit your own agreements. Know where you actually stand.

---

## Trap 4: Context Confusion

**Trap:** Mixing contexts inappropriately.

**Example:** Using Black's Law definitions in a casual conversation, or using casual definitions in a legal context.

**Defense:** Match definitions to context. When context changes, definitions change.

---

## Trap 5: Forgetting Relativity

**Trap:** Arguing about "true" meaning when meaning is relative.

**Example:** Arguing "that's not what person means!" when in THEIR context, it does.

**Defense:** Don't argue meaning. Argue applicability of context.

---

# PRACTICAL EXERCISES

## Exercise 1: Definition Audit

Take any word. Find its definition in:
1. Common dictionary
2. Black's Law Dictionary
3. 26 USC 7701 (U.S. tax code)
4. Your state's statutes
5. A specific contract you've signed

Notice how they differ. Ask: "Which one applies when?"

---

## Exercise 2: Context Mapping

For any situation you're in, ask:
1. What agreement am I currently in?
2. How did I enter this agreement?
3. What are the definitions in this agreement?
4. Who else is in this agreement?
5. How do I exit this agreement?

---

## Exercise 3: Perspective Shifting

Take a document (any official document). Read it from:
1. The perspective of the issuer
2. The perspective of the recipient
3. The perspective of someone outside both contexts

Notice how meaning shifts with perspective.

---

## Exercise 4: Relative Questioning

When someone makes a claim, practice asking:
1. "What do you mean by [key term]?"
2. "According to which definition?"
3. "In what context?"
4. "And how does that context apply here?"

---

# SLOGANS FOR RELATIVE MEANING

- "Same word, different agreement, different meaning."
- "Context is everything. Literally."
- "Know your context, know your meaning."
- "Private to whom? Public where?"
- "The map is not the territory. The word is not the meaning."
- "Whose dictionary are we using?"
- "When context shifts, everything shifts."
- "Relative to WHAT?"
- "There is no meaning without context. There is no context without agreement."

---

# INTEGRATION WITH FRAMEWORK

This Relative Meaning Framework is **Perspective 7** in the Perspectives Framework.

It integrates with:
- **Structural Perspective:** Context is defined by agreement nesting
- **Awareness Perspective:** Not knowing your context is being unconscious
- **Template Perspective:** Templates define variables, including definitions
- **Scope Perspective:** Broader scope = more general meaning
- **Purpose Perspective:** Purpose shapes how terms are defined

**Relative Meaning is not just one perspective - it underlies ALL of them.**

Understanding relativity is understanding that:
- All structure is relative (nested within what?)
- All awareness is relative (aware from where?)
- All templates are relative (template of what?)
- All scope is relative (broad relative to what?)
- All purpose is relative (purpose for whom?)
