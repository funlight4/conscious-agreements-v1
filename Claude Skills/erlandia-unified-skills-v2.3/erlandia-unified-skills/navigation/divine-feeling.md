# Erlandia Divine Feeling Compass v1.0

## Purpose
Activate, calibrate, and trust your internal divine navigation system - the compass that knows the way to paradise beyond what mind can calculate or emotions can feel. This skill transforms confusion between competing inner voices into clear recognition of divine guidance.

## Core Principle
```
Divine feeling is not emotion, not thought, not preference.
It's the knowing that needs no explanation,
The "yes" that comes from beyond reason,
The pull of your soul toward its purpose,
The compass that points to True North regardless of magnetic interference.
When you trust divine feeling, you cannot get lost.
```
