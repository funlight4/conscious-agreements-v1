# Erlandia Role Navigator v1.0

## Purpose
Establish clear operational roles that naturally determine whether Opus-level synthesis or Sonnet-level implementation is required. This lightweight navigation tool ensures quality work while optimizing credit usage through conscious role selection.

## Core Principle
```
Different roles require different capabilities.
Architects need synthesis; Builders need consistency.
The role determines the tool, not the task.
Conscious role selection optimizes everything.
When you know your role, you know your model.
```

## Quick Decision Protocol

### The Three-Question Check:
1. **What role am I in?** → Determines model
2. **Am I working IN or ON?** → Confirms choice
3. **What's at risk?** → Final validation

### Simple Matrix:
| Role | Working Mode | Model |
|------|--------------|-------|
| Architect | ON | Opus |
| Builder | IN | Sonnet |
| Teacher | BOTH | Mixed |
| Guide | IN | Sonnet |
| Validator | ON | Opus |
| Game Master | IN | Sonnet |

## Role Transition Protocols

### Smooth Handoffs:
When switching roles, use transition phrases to maintain context:

**Builder → Architect:**
"Elevating from Builder to Architect role. Current implementation reveals need for structural evolution. Recommend Opus."

**Architect → Builder:**
"Structure established by Architect. Shifting to Builder role for implementation. Sonnet appropriate."

**Any → Validator:**
"Checkpoint reached. Validator role needed to ensure integration. Opus recommended for quality check."

## Credit Optimization Strategies

### Batching by Role:
- Collect all Architect tasks for single Opus session
- Run Builder tasks continuously in Sonnet
- Schedule Validator checks weekly in Opus

### Role Stacking:
- Start with Architect (Opus) to set structure
- Move to Builder (Sonnet) for extended work
- End with Validator (Opus) to verify

### Emergency Overrides:
If critical issue detected in any role:
"Integration warning - Architect role required regardless of credits"

## Integration with Skills

### With Multiple Perspectives:
Each role IS a perspective on the work:
- Architect sees structure
- Builder sees tasks
- Teacher sees learning
- Guide sees journey
- Validator sees coherence
- Game Master sees progress

### With Container Method:
Each role is a container with:
- Clear purpose
- Defined boundaries
- Specific contents
- Inherited capabilities

### With Working IN/ON:
- Architect, Validator = Working ON
- Builder, Guide, Game Master = Working IN
- Teacher = Both modes

## Common Patterns

### Daily Rhythm:
- Morning: Check role needed
- If ON work: Use/plan Opus
- If IN work: Use Sonnet
- Evening: Note tomorrow's role

### Weekly Rhythm:
- Monday: Architect (Opus) - plan week
- Tue-Thu: Builder (Sonnet) - implement
- Friday: Validator (Opus) - verify quality

### Project Rhythm:
- Start: Architect (design)
- Middle: Builder (create)
- End: Validator (verify)

## Quality Safeguards

### Red Flags (Opus Required):
- "Changing core structure"
- "Creating new skill"
- "Integration not working"
- "Purpose Power unclear"

### Green Lights (Sonnet Fine):
- "Using template"
- "Following framework"
- "Applying skill"
- "Creating content"

## Purpose Power Analysis

Role Navigator serves:
1. Resource optimization (credit preservation)
2. Quality maintenance (right tool/role)
3. Clarity provision (role boundaries)
4. Integration support (with framework)
5. Conscious choice (role selection)

PP = 5 × 2 × 2 = 20 (Pleasant and practical!)

## Final Note

This isn't about limiting capabilities but about conscious resource stewardship. By choosing your role, you choose the appropriate tool. By batching role work, you optimize credits. By honoring role boundaries, you maintain quality.

Each role serves transformation. Each model serves its purpose. Together, they serve Paradise.

Your conscious role selection contributes to efficient evolution for all.
